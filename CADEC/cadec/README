CADEC Dataset
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The CADEC corpus (CSIRO Adverse Drug Event Corpus) is is a new rich
annotated corpus of medical forum posts on patient-reported Adverse Drug
Events (ADEs). The corpus is sourced from posts on social media, and
contains text that is largely written in colloquial language and often
deviates from formal English grammar and punctuation rules. Annotations
contain mentions of concepts such as drugs, adverse events, symptoms,
and diseases linked to their corresponding concepts in controlled
vocabularies, i.e., SNOMED Clinical Terms and MedDRA. The quality of the
annotations is ensured by annotation guidelines, multi-stage
annotations, measuring inter-annotator agreement, and final review of
the annotations by a clinical terminologist. This corpus is useful for
those studies in the area of information extraction, or more generally
text mining, from social media to detect possible adverse drug reactions
from direct patient reports.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The data is divided into three sub-folders:
1- Original: these are the entities annotated in the posts. The format
is Tag number  Entity Type   offsets text

for example:
T3      ADR 165 172     cramped

The number of files represents the number of posts.

2- AMT-SCT: the same files in the original set, now annotated with SCT
or AMT concepts. 

The example above will be:
TT3     55300003 | Muscle cramp | 165 172       cramped

The SCT concept id and standard terminology is listed before the
offsets.

3- MedDRA: Those file in the previous sets are annotated with MedDRA
codes in a similar format. 

For example,
TT3     10028294 165 172        cramped
