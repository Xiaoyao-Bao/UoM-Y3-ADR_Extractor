Leg calf cramps, eyes feeling of pressure or spaced out feeling.
Horrible depression, wild mood swings, feeling of impending doom, sinus congestion, extreme fatigue, lack of motivation and diffuculty thinking, memory loss.
I went from a highly motivated regional manager to a person who dosent want to get out of bed.
No amount of sleep makes me feel rested.
My legs are killing me and I thank God I found this website.
My mind was starting to deteriorate and I couldnt remember anything without difficulty.
My driving became dangerous.
I have stopped the cursed drug and after 2 days my energy level has increased dramaticly.
No one warned me of these risks.
This drug should be taken off the market.
