After using Lipitor for 2.5 years, I decided to stop two weeks ago because of severe pain in my left arm.
I am left handed and recently couldn't normally do my job.
Twice I told my doctor about pain in my arm and he didn't take that seriously, ignoring my complaint.
After two weeks of not taking Lipitor my arm almost recovered and I can work without any pain or any problem.
It started a long time ago with tingling in my arms, they were often fall asleep, usually when I wake up in the morning.
From month to month pain was worst until I almost lost all strength and couldn't use my arm.
Anyway, I think I made a good decision by not using Lipitor anymore (my doctor will be mad at me).
I will try with natural supplements and more exercising.
I am very "anxious" about medication that can cause myopathy, liver damage or cancer.
