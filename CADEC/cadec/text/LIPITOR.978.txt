Was put on lipitor 3 months ago because of high cholesteral.
Took for a month and seemed to have problems with feet, etc but kept taking.
I had tests done after a month.
My doctor sent a letter and said to cut the dose in half for a month and have tests again.
After my second set of tests she called me and told me to go off completely.
She said she realized that my cholesteral would go back up, but CPK is of concern.
Was raised to mid 200's.
After a month I went in and of course my cholesteral was back up and my CPK level was elevated to over 500.
Now am having another blood test a week later.
Not sure what it will show but I feel horrible.
Tingly hands, terrible musche aches.
She told me no excercise until we determine what the problem is with CPK level.
My husband said my face looks puffy.
My eyes hurt all the time.
I look sickly.
This is horrible.
Never again!
DON'T TAKE THIS!!!!!!!.
