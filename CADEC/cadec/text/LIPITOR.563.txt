I have been taking lipitor for 3 years.
I though the side effects was just me.
It wasn't until I talked to a friend and she told me about her boyfriends side effects, it was like she was talking ab out me.
Memory loss, joint pain, swollen feet and hands, sore ribs, inability to sleep well, no sex drive, moodiness, always tired, lack of energy, increased heart rate, headaches every day, and dry joints.
This all became worst when my dose was increased from 40mg to 80 mg 3 months ago.
I have now decided to try other methods to reduce my cholesterol.
(Mine is hereditary).
I have a wonderful chiro whom suggested I try lecithin, with Omega 3, and Vit C.
Here goes, I hope to be to get back to my walk of 6km a day.
