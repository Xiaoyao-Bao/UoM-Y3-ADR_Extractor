I stumbled across this website which was nothing short of a miracle to me.
I was searching for answers on why I am in such pain throughout my body, mental confusion at times and also short term memory loss which all seemed to be growing steadily worse for the past few years.
I blamed it on stress (with a dying husband), arthritis, advancing age etc and even discussed leg pain and body cramps with my doctor which he attributed chiefly to age and arthritis.
I even had tests done on arteries to see if that could be the cause as I have an aortic aneurysem and thought perhaps my problems could be from poor circulation or blockage somewhere.
They all checked out okay.
It has been unbearable for several weeks now off and on and I suffered fatigue, lack of energy and growing depression and a feeling a fragility where I had always been a strong woman until recent years.
I looked up fibromyalgia thinking I might have that but when I casually looked up lipitor the ratings leaped out at me.
These people all were experiencing my symptoms!!!
THANK YOU for providing this web site it may very well have saved my life.
I am contacting my doctor immediately and as of now no more lipitor.
It did lower my cholestral but greatly lowered my quality of life and I guess I am going to do exercise and have joined weight watchers and see if I can control it in that manner.
I am 67 and have been on Lipitor for several years with the symptoms growing steadily until now unbearable.
