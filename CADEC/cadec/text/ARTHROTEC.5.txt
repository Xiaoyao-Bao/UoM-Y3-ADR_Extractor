No side effects.
I tried the advertised Arthritis medicines with severe side-effects and only tried this one because the doctor had samples.
Instead of taking the pill 2X daily, as prescribed I take it at most once per day, usually about 3-4 times per week, but often skipping a week or two at a time.
My arthritis has been under control for years and only causes me trouble if I skip taking the pills for about a month.
At the time this was prescribed the doctor was discussing the strongest possible medicines in serious (threatening) doses.
This drug has been a god-send for me.
