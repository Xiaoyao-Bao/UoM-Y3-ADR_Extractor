Terrible charlie horses, cramping, my neck glands hurt.
My mother was began to have symptoms of als shortly after her lipitor dose was increased.
She wasn't formally diagnosed for a year and a half after that.
I lost my mother on January 12, 2008.
I want to know if lipitor is connected to als.
My husband was on it for less than 6 months and he noticed leg pains, neck glands hurt, trouble swallowing and more.
