greatly reduced cholesterol levels.
But I've been experiencing muscle/joint pain, mostly in legs, thighs /calves.
Some in arms.
At times pain so bad I can hardly move or walk with a limp as I favor the bad leg.
Works for cholesterol, but if these are the side effects, I think I'll take my chances with the cholesterol - doesn't make sense to have low cholesterol if I can't move or do anything else.
