I am 43 years old and have been taking Lipitor for a year and a half.
I am having horrible aching in my fingers, knees, hips & toes.
Went to my yearly exam this week and blood test reveals arthritis.
No family history of arthritis, has to be the Lipitor.
The drug did bring my cholesterol down over 100 points - but is it worth having arthritis to achieve that?.
