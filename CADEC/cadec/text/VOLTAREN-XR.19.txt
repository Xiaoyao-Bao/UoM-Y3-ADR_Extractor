I took this medication for about 2 weeks.
On day two I noticed a rash on the outside part of my left arm, then the it spread to to my back and front of my neck by day three.
I also noticed some dizziness, bloated stomach, gas, and muscle weakness specially in my back.
I had kidney pain on the right side to the point I could not bend forwad.
I stoped taking this medication by the second week I was on it, however it is taking me a while to get better from the weakness, the rash is improving but my skin is stained with multiple brown dots.
I would not recommend this medication.
