recently wrote about my husband who was diagnosed with parkinson's--he stopped Lipitor 4 months ago, and began mega doses of coq10 -and other antioxidants and magnesium orotate- 4 weeks ago--memory problem has disappeared, tremor decreased to a minor.
we think my husband's symptoms of parkinson's was caused by/brought on by Lipitor's lowering of coq10 and interrupting many other metabolic pathways within the body including selenium production.
time is required to determine if reversal of symptoms permanent.
Have received letter about a case of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis dianosis changed to.
