memory loss, transient amnesia, severe shoulder and knee pain, insomnia, extreme tiredness,hard to get up in the AM and hard to stay awake, crippling back pain, depression, loss of balance.
I took Pravachol and Zocor before Lipitor - cardiologist increased dose of Lipitor to 40mg and 80mg.
The last 4 years of my life have been a physical and mental nightmare.
As soon as stopped Lipitor immediately felt much better but degenerative back disease (MD said was due to aging) is still severe but improving somewhat.
Statins destroyed my life, I am certain of.
