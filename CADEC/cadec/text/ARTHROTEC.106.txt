none that I can think of.
I recently had bilateral knee replacement.
Prior to that, Arthrotec was the only drug that helped.
I tried every drug on the market,but, to no avail.
I took 50 mg. 3 times a day of Arthrotec and was almost pain free.
I highly recommend it to anyone that suffers from arthritis.
