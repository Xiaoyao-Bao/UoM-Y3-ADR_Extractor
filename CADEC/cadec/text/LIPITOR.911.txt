severe muscle pain.
could not lie on either side in bed.
each day it got worse and my shoulder pain was unbearable.
Because of Lipitor I had very serious depression and thoughts of hurting myself.
I figured out myself to stop taking Lipitor as my doctor never connected the drug with the side effects I always told him about.
