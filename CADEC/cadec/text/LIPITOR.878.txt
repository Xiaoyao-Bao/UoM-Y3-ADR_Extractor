hair loss, weight gain, muscle pain.
After suffering form real bad side effects (hair loss, weight gain, blurred vision) I decided to stop all the chemicals.
I am fed up with all those medications which ALL induce side effects, for which your doctor will prescribe more and more medications.
That is when hell starts.
My hair was falling off, I could not lose weight even exercising and eating healthy food.
When I stopped Lipitor, my hair stopped falling immediately and I lost 4 lbs the 1st week, without doing anything different.
You completely destroy your metabolism absorbing chemicals.
Now I stopped all that and I am going the NATURAL way with good results.
I recommend acupuncture, homeopathy, natural supplements (I highly recommend Apple Cider Vinegar and raw honey, those made my blood pressure go down by 30 points!), good nutrition and exercise are much better and you will not enrich those pharmaceutical companies which are after your money, just trying to erase the symptoms but NOT the cause.
Take charge!
It is time.
