after visiting this site it is like looking into a mirrow.
i have had most of the problems many are having,infact it is 4 am can not sleep for just turning in bed is painful.
decided to do a little research on LIPITOR it has dropped cholosterol from 395 to 187 and tri from 1100 to 300 but i wounder if it worth the side-effects.
before medication had mild heart attack was put on lipitor, at first i felt good but now back pain and tiredness is at a high level, my wife complains that i need exercise but she does not understand i hurt just as much now as i did with the heart attack, i guess it all boils down to if i could get some rest, but seems impossible for just moving in bed is painful.
