I female, 5 feet 7 and a half inches tall, 117 lbs.
I do not smoke and have never smoked.
I do not have high blood pressure, nor have I ever had it.
I am not diabetic.
I am 45 and a half years old and was on 20 mg of Lipitor due to genetically high LDL for a period of seven months.
At that point, I started having terrible, migratory joint pain all over my body that was very distinct and pronounced.
I also had disabling fatigue and flu-like malaise.
Some nights I would go to bed at 6 pm and not get up until 8 or 9 the next morning.
I was quite ill.
My doctor did tons of lab work to rule out things like rheumatoid arthriitis, lupus, Lyme disease and active parvovirus infection.
These all came back NEGATIVE.
Finally, I was taken off Lipitor to see if the drug had anything to do with my symptoms.
Within 72 hours I noted an improvement; within seven days, the symptoms were completely gone and I was restored to health.
I will not ever take Lipitor again as I believe it is liver-toxic and slowly poisons the patient.
It did a great job of lowering my LDL (173 down to 60).
My total cholesterol went from 238 down to 143.
However, it nearly killed me in the process and I believe it is almost like a slow-acting poison.
