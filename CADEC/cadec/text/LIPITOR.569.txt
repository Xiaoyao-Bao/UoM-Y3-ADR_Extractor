Severe (burning) pain in upper and lower left arm and left hand, stiffness and pain in both knees, pain in upper back (over left shoulder blade).
Pain in both elbows.
Pain in left arm at night intense that I can't sleep and no position seems to relieve it.
Have ceased to go to gym, as this is wholly impractical, given my loss of fitness.
Pain is so intense that pain killers do not help.
I cannot understand why this condition should come on so suddenly.
It started with a flu-like symptoms, three to four weeks ago, followed by pains in my left knee.
I am presently being tested for arthritus, but there is no history of arthritus in my family and I am just 61.
The pain has been so intense that my life is being made a misery.
Will now stop taking Liptor having read the comments on this site and hope I recover.
Assuming Liptor is the culprit I am really annoyed with my doctor.
and will tell him so.
I went to him feeling totally OK nine months ago and he advised me to start taking this drug.
Better to live ten years feeling OK and then drop dead of a heart attack, rather than commit suicide to escape the intense pain caused by a prescribed drug.
