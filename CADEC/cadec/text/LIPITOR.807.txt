Within a week or two of taking the prescribe dose, I began developing something I never had before: eczema.
It became progressively worse, and by the end of the first month had created a massive triangular rash on my forehead, as well as a patch on one cheek.
The skin was very red and rough, and made public life miserable and embarassing.
I stopped taking Lipitor and the rash cleared up greatly, but has NEVER gone away completly, flaring up slightly from time to time, but not nearly as bad as it was during dosing with Lipitor.
I was not taking any other medications at the time, and never had eczema before.
The anti-lipid effect of Lipitor was unusually strong in my case, causing my CHO to drop below 90 (from a baseline of over 200).
by the end of the first 2 weeks of dosing, my physician had me cutting the smallest dose tablet in half to be taken once a day.
Even so, the rash continued to enlarge and get worse, so I was forced to stop taking the Lipitor.
