Was put on 10mg, the lowest dose.
I experienced cramping in my stomach, and some muscle side effects.
I decided to go off of it after a few months.
When my Cholesterol shot up to 300, I reconsidered and tried it again.
But I cut the dosage in half with a pill cutter taking only 5mg per day.
This is something people should consider.
Where the first time my cholesterol went down to 188 with 10mg, on 5mg it went down to 198.
it has since gone up to 220 on that dosage but still a far cry from 300.
But now (after about 9 months) I am once again considering going off of it.
I have terrible constipation and have been having bad muscle pains.
in my neck and shoulders, lower back and right hip,
Then the other day it was on the news that a study showed statin drugs can CAUSE heart problems.
and CANCER especially in the elderly.
It also said that 7 our of 10 researchers who told us they should lower the bar on cholesterol levels (meaning more people should take it at lower numbers) were connected to the drug companies who make and sell it!!!!.
