Was on LIPITOR for 18 days.
Developed sore legs, sore back, general tiredness and my head was foggy .
making it difficult to concentrate.
At day 16, developed excruciating toothache (that moved from day to day).
Gave up on day 18.
At end of day 19, the toothache had gone.
I would not recommend this drug to anyone.
My father-in-law was on the same drug to defeat cholesterol and ended up in a wheelchair with symptoms of Parkison's disease.
He died of a massive heart attack last year.
