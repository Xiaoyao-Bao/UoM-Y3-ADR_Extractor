Horrific medication - Suffered an acute pancreatic attack with critical blood levels that almost caused my death.
My entire body was "shutting" down.
My blood reports were at critical levels, BP was very low 98/60, fever for over 6 weeks, weight loss of 10 lbs.,yellow color to my skin, couldn't walk straight,prostate infection, sweating, nausea, pain in stomach & back, urination effected, hoarseness/coughing, heart racing, disoriented.
Then the doctor in charge left us floundering on our own, going from one specialist after another to counter what was happening.
My children did some research on the web about my drugs that I was taking, which included Voltaren,and learned about the adverse reactions to this drug and I stopped Voltaren.
The specialists agreed with this conclusion, since they were exact to my problems.
My body reacted and I recovered gradually.
My advice to all - STOP - Find something else.
I lost 2 months of my life and I still don't remember the entire e.
If you are taking this drug - Make absolutely sure that you get blood work done every 6 months, in order to catch any critical levels in your blood.
Then - STOP - the drug.
