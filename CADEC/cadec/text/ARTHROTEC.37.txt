I took my first pill this morning, with food as noted.
Rode my bike 12 minutes to work & didn't think I could make it.
Got to work, ran to the bathroom with SEVERE abdominal cramping, had massive diarrhea & severe cramping continued for 2 hours.
I had to leave work & go home sick.
I would much rather put up with my debilitating chronic knee pain (waiting for surgery) than to ever take another pill.
I spent $100 on the stupid pills - what an utter & complete waste of money.
