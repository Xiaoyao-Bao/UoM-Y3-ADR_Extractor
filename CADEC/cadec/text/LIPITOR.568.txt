Extremely dry mouth, severe joint aches, muscle cramps in lower legs, sever swelling of feet, hands and ankles, difficulty breathing, tired, memory loss, mild depression, diminished eyesight.
While these symptoms crept up on me over an 18 month period, I like many people assume it's an age thing .
I just turned 50 and family and friends would laugh about my forgetfulness.
The severity of that memory failure frightened me enough to do extensive research on Lipitor.
I stopped taking it the next day and within 72 hours my swelling decreased significantly, muscle aches and joint pain disappeared, memory loss is not as severe, breathing is easier, stamina is back etc
I mentioned these same things to my cousin who has since stopped taking it as well.
She can't thank me enough for giving her life back!
I haven't told my doctor yet, she doesn't like when I am informed.
need to change doctors.
