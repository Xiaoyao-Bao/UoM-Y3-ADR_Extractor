rhabdomyolosis w/cpk of 14,600 in aug./2006.
2 biopsies confirmed statin damage at mayo/rochester,mn.
even then only 3of5 drs. would admit statin damage.
now live w/myalgia,periphael neuropathy,tinninitus and rheumatoid arthritis.
unbelievable amount of people come to talk about their aches and pains since going on statin drugs,how can the medical community continue to deceive at such a level-{truly shameful}.
