I have been taking Lipitor for at least 5 years and lately I have had very bad muscle pain and fatique not knowing why.
I am type 11 diabetic and my doctor put me on Lipitor to keep my cholestrol down.
It has lowered it and kept it down but I was told by the doctor just yesterday to stop the Lipitor because of the syptoms I am having.
I am hoping that these syptoms will go away since I can barely walk without pain and fatique.
I have also experienced gastro problem.
I would like to hear from anyone who may be off the drug and feeling better??.
