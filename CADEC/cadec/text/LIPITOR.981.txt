Dizziness,falls,poor memory,loss of fine motor skills,stiffness in legs, sore feet.
I began having falls shortly after starting lipitor approx 5years ago.
Had an EEG at that time with no abnormalities.
Had another EEG 6months ago with Frontal Lobe abnormalities which I suspect is due to Lipitor.
Started on 20mg and progressed to 80mg.
