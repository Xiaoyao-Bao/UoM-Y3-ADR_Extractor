Weak muscles.
Achey like when you have a very high fever, only without the fever.
Elevated white blood cell count (very high), but liver emzymes were normal.
I was on lowest dose.
My LDL started at 90, but MD insisted that because I am diabetic, I should be on lipitor and try to get below 70.
Lipitor knocked it down to 25.
I do not know if the problems were due to Lipitor, or having LDL down to 25.
I asked MD he stated They (whomever they are), have not established a low threshold for what is safe .
I stated that just because it has not been proven in a lab, does not mean it is not true.
I went off the meds, and am now in search of a new MD, as I have felt worse under this DR care than ever before in my life.
