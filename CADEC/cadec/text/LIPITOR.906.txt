taken since 2004, just got off this stuff a month or so now, had memory loss, extreme ache in left arm and sometimes left leg.
thought it was another issue, spent the last 4 years with neurologists doing MRI, nerve tests, every test known to detect the reason for this.
nothing found.
decided to stop taking lipitor and am much improved.
can do many things without my arm aching now.
this ache was extreme, almost unbearable, many doctors just ignore the side effects of this drug.
