Took for 2 weeks.
Towards the end, began getting tightness in my throat, tingling eyes and lips.
These symptoms worsened over the following two weeks, especially the tightness in my throat until a severe case resulted in me colapsing from a heart attack and hospitalised for a week.
Would never use it again or reccommend it.
