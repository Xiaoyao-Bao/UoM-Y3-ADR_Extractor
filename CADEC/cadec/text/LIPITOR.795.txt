Body aches (knees, back and especially chest) which increased with time, lethargic, short term memory lacking, concentration is worse than ever.
Worked wonders for my cholesterol but ruined everything else.
I kept telling my doctor about the body aches but he always blamed it on something else.
stress, anxiety, lack of exercise.
I'm still on the lipitor but I'm contacting my doctor to try another cholesterol med.
I'm glad I came across this site.
