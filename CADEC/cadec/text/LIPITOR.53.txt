I have had tendonitis in my knees and troublesome pain in my lower legs and feet.
My knee swells with fluid, so that any movement causes excrutiating pain.
At first, I thought that this might be gout, because it runs in my family, and my toes swell up occasionally.
But, after my doctor confirmed that my swollen knees were not gout, I began to consider other causes.
It dawned on me to check the internet concerning the Lipitor I have been taking.
Sure enough, many people have the same troubles.
I used to be able to walk for endless miles.
For about the same amount of time I have been taking this drug, I have been hobbling around, cautious of every painful step.
Although it may lower my cholesterol, tomorrow, I will stop taking the Lipitor.
