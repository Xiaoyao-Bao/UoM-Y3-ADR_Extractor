I was taking this medication for 2 months.
Intense pain in both calves and thighs when walking only a few blocks.
Pain in lower back, forearms and left shoulder.
I thought I was getting PAD.
I couldn't climb stairs or walk while shopping with my wife.
I needed to rest every few minutes.
I don't even have high cholesterol, but my cardiologist suggested I take Lipitor as a preventitive treatment.
I'm glad I found this site.
I have stopped taking it for 3 days now, but pain persists.
