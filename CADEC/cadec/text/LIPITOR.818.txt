Type II diabetic, formerly on oral medication but converted to insulin injections twice daily after bypass surgery.
Prescribed Lipitor 40 mg/day although TC was below 200 mcg/dl.
After taking drug for several months, I experienced progressive unsteasiness walking & could not stand in one place for more than a few seconds without loss of balance.
Intermittent acute pain in both feet, for which I was prescribed Neurontin.
Also experienced weakness in legs and knees causing some limping as well as numbness in fingers & general weakness in hands (difficulty removing gas cap on car).
After accidentally running out of Lipitor, I noticed a significant improvement in balance within 2-3 days.
Also found that blood glucose level dropped significantly both AM and PM after halting Lipitor.
I also discontinued Neurontin and began taking coenzyme Q10 120 mg/day.
I have researched Lipitor and other statin drug side effects on internet and will no longer take Lipitor or any statin drugs.
Feel much better after 30 days statin-free.
