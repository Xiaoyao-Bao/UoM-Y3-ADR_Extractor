Both husband and wife on low dosage (10 mg)
We are having extreme reactions to heat.
When the weather is hot we both get extreme headaches.
This happens with even slight temp changes/worse with high tems outside.
(80 degrees is already bad) Husband starts sweating alot.
Husband also has diabetes.
Both have flu like symtoms.
Help!!
Anyone else having these problems?.
