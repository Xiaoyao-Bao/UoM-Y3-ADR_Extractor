Random severe cramping, diarrhea, increased menstrual blood flow.
The day I took my first Arthrotec, I started experiencing urinary incontinence.
It's not severe but enough to be disruptive and require a pad.
I haven't seen this listed in anyone's symptomology.
Has anyone else had this experience?.
