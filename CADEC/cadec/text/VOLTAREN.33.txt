I have vaginal bleeding and cramping.
.
.
it's taken me almost a week to realize this bleeding is due to the medication.
The bleeding started almost immediately after taking the first dose.
I initially thought I was having my period (even though it was not time).
If anyone can give me info regarding how long this bleeding and cramping lasts, I would appreciate it.
