Calf Pain.
Calves tire and burn Very quickly, requiring very frequent stops on light uphill walking and stairs.
Also, I've always been prone to leg and foot cramps,(twice a year) and am experiencing Some additional cramping, mostly upon waking.
(twice a month) Generally become fatigued quicker, need to rest more often due to tired or burning muscles: NOT breathlessness.
Exercize is even Less attractive now!.
