Joint pain in shoulder, I could not lift my arms over my head.
Extreme pain in upper back area.
Pain in knees, short term memory loss.
Although the drug actually took me from a TC of 250 down to 174, the side effects were just too much to bear.
I was taking pain killers to numb out the pain from this drug.
Unfortunately upon stopping my cholesterol went to 280 in 8 weeks.
I am now starting Pravachol.
