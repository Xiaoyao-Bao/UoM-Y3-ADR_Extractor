I took one dose and 15 minutes later i felt dizzy and had chest pain and felt like my life was gonna slip away and die.
i called my Dr and he is an idiot .
he told me that this medicine does not cause these symptoms I hate when Pharmecitical company push these and have DR's advertise and experiment on us like animals they jsut make us sicker.
