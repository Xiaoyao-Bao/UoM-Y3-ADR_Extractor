I was on 5mg - cut a 10mg pill in half.
After about 2 weeks taking it I woke up with leg cramps.
During the day if I squatted (e.g. in the garden) or tried to get on a ladder I got foot/leg cramps.
I mentioned it to my doctor who said it couldn't possibly be related to the Lipitor .
It kept getting worse and worse - legs began feeling very tired, couldn't go up stairs easily, had cramping events in my legs 3-4 times a day.
I took 5mg/day of Lipitor for a year but finally quit as my legs were hurting too much.
Most cramping stopped within a couple of days but there was a long tail - it has only been in the last two years that all cramping stopped (having been off since 2005).
It did help get my TC down to 180 from 220, and my HDL to 70-90 frum 30.
My legs are still very weak even now - but they don't cramp.
My physician said it was all in my head.
