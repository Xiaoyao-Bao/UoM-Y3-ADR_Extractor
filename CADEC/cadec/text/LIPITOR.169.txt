I have been taking 20mg of lipitor for 1 year, It has lowered my cholestrol to 225 but I cannot deal with the agony of constant gas and loose stools.
I am also experiencing heel pain.
The loose stools and gas are more than I can bear.
anyone switch to a different statin drug that did not cause loose stools and constant gas?.
