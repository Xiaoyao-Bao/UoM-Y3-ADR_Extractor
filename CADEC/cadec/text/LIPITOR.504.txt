Extreme back pain, nerve damage, breathing problems to the point of hospitalization stiffness all over body, muscle damage, hugh black and blue marks 6 in., hair loss, dizzyness, vision problems, close to blackouts, sinus problems,temperature, heart palputations, abdominal problems, bleeding, gas.
Wore braces on calf, ankle, full knee brace and two small braces and crutches, wrist locked up on me, wore a brace for months, just to mention a few of the problems I had on all Statins.
Doctors left me on Statins for seven years.
My advise is not to go on any Statins I still hurt after 2 years off them.
