My wife and I bo,th shared weakness in legs, pain in legs, hair losss, Rashes, itchy when I went to sit down instead of sitng normaly I would almost fall down in the chair no control no strength, upon getting up I had to hold on to something to get up.
No stopping action going down hill, arms, hands, have little or no grip, I am on 20 mgs, my wife 10,,, we have stopped as of this date.
I(male) have been on Lipitor for almost 3 yrs, I had open heart surgery 3 yrs ago and since then Ive been on it, My wife gets burning sensations, pains in her back, frequent urination(both of us) and a hard time sleeping.
Its bad news.
