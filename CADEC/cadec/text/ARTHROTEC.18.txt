slightly heavier menstrual cycle.
An absolute miracle drug for me.
None of the stomach issues others seem to have.
I was at the point where I was becoming highly immobile and in constant pain.
Started taking arthrotec and had IMMEDIATE relief.
honestly never thought I would feel that way again.
recently pain has started to increase though, and not sure if I've overworked my back.
or if I'm becoming intolerant.
Have recommended to two others who have had similar exceptional results for chronic arthritic type issues.
