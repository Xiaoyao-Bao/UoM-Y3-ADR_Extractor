After a mild heart attack 2 years ago I was put on 10mg of Lipitor.
I began having leg and feet cramps.
I stopped for a month and felt better but my cholesterol went back up.
The doctor insisted I go back on.
When I complained of feet and leg cramps the doctor put me on 5 mg.
This helped but after 3 months my feet are cramping and I wake several times a night.
I am also having back and hip pain and am feeling tired and depressed.
I am going to stop again.
It is not worth going through the pain.
The doctor does not believe it is the Lipitor but I feel better when off.
