My boyfriend is 49 and has had high cholesterol for about 10 years.
his doctor put him on Lipitor.
he took it twice and could hardly stay awake.
Also noticed pains in his legs and weakness in his knees after the first dose.
He has stopped and will not resume this treatment.
There must be a better alternative.
Don't do it!
There are too many websites like these with pages and pages of similar complaints.
