My doctor has started me out on 80mg a day of lipitor.
I have only been taking it for a little over a week.
I started feeling sick to my stomach about two days ago, and I have been feeling very fatigued.
My head has been twitching and today I noticed hand tremors.
Also feel like I am in a fog.
Have not had blood results yet to determine if it has lowered my cholesterol or not.
