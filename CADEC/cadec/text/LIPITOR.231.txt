Reduced chol from 300 to 160 (29 yrs old in great shape just genetically high).
Miracle drug- until year 3.
Leg began having vibrating sensation (kept thinking cell phone was in pocket but it wasnt).
Entire body ached; toes felt arthritic; had problems with memory & coordination (fell down stairs # of times).
Stopped and all symptoms have gone away.
Experienced same issue w/ all Statins- not just lipitor.
