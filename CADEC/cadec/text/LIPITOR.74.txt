After taking Crestor and having muscle pain and lack of control when standing in the mornings, my Dr prescribed Lipitor.
I have had increasing non stop Pain in neck and back and now severe tingling and burning in hands and feet with itchy crawly feeling all over.
My bad levels have decreased but now I am afraid I may have nerve damage or liver problems and after reading this sites comments will stop taking Lipitor.
