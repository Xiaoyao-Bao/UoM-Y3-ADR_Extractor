On the third day taking just 5mg, stomach cramps and loose stools set in.
Gas, bloating and fatigue followed.
Just wanted to sleep.
Couldn't exercise or eat.
Started using anti-acids for the first time in 15 years.
Three weeks after quitting the drug, the symptoms persist.
I am 41, male, taking no meds (except 72 hours of Lipitor), with no history of smoking, diabetes, etc This drug (or class of drugs) is potentially very nasty.
