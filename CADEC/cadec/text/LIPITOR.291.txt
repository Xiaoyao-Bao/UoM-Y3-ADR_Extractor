Muscle weakness and extreme pain, nausea, diarrhea, dark urine, dizziness.
I have been off of it for 4 days and can barely walk.
I hope that this is not permanent.
I thought that I had the flu bug tht was going around the neighborhood.
I had taken pravochol for years with not side effects, but wasn't lowering my cholesterol enough.
