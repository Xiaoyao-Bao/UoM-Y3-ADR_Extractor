Heartburn and stomach upset.
It seems to be working pretty well.
I still have pain but less severe.
I have been somewhat concerned about taking this drug for so long due to the possible side effects, but my Dr checks me out (blood work, etc )every four months and I seem to be doing allright.
I don't want to get started on stronger, possibly habit forming drugs.
