I've been on it for 18 months and only after 15 months the muscle pain started - particularly in the glutes, calves and thighs but also in the back and neck.
A general feeling of weakness.
Difficulty getting up out of a chair.
I've also had palpitations but don't know if that could be the cause.
Also a hard to describe feeling like a very inner mild panic attack which only lasts a minute or two and is helped by deep breathing.
Abdominal rash for the last 6 months - I thought it was shingles but the doctor said no and prescribed an ointment.
I have had high blood pressure for the last three months too but am not sure if Lipitor could be the cause.
