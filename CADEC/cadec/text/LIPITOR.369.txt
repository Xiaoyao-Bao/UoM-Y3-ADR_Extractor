My left arm and neck that hurt from chronic pain are now exploding.
I hope from just taking a short time no perm damage is done.
The pain is unbearable.
I was down to a level 4 and now hitting 10 for parts of each day.
I told the dr.
I felt socked in the arm, he thinks my chronic problem is just getting worse.
I hope he is wrong because I cannot take this much longer.
