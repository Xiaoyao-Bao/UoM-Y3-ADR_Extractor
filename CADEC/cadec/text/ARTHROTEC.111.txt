This greatly improved the swelling when I had a surgery on both legs.
There weren't any side effects.
maybe a little gas but may not be related to the drug.
I would recommend this to anyone that has swelling of any sort to help heal an injury.
The doctor did say to only take it 5 days though because it reduces mucus in the stomach and it can cause extreme stomach pain if taken too long.
