I had a chronic backache that kept getting worse.
I complained about this for some time finally a doctor scheduled me for a MRI.
The results indicated I have arthritis so I accepted that and attributed the aches to simply getting old, (69 yrs).
Two weeks ago it got so bad that I stopped my regular exercise.
About a week ago, in the middle of the night after taking my usual Lipitor dose, while making my nightly trip to the toilet, a severe muscle back cramp almost sent me to the floor.
After finishing my business, I hardly could sleep that night.
As I got out of bed that morning I started getting severe muscle spasms in the same old place.
The spasms lasted most of the day and gradually the intensity, frequency and duration diminished.
Since I had done nothing recently to cause a cramp or spasm, and realizing that in the past, the back aches usually were the worst in the morning but got better during the day and best at night just before my Lipitor dose, I suspected Lipitor.
I quit them 7 days ago and my back has not been this good in months!.
