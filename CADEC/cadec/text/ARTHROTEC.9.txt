vomitting - I have to fight to not throw up I am supposed to take this twice a day - but it makes me soooooo sick that I take literally as I a going to bed, so that I am asleep before the sickness kicks in.
I have tried and tried to take the day dose - but I would rather live without the sickness - its just too awful.
very painful joints - but with this tablet, the pain is much much reduced.
If I miss a couple of days I really know about it.
If I could find the same sort of thing without the EXTREME nausea - I would switch drugs in teh blink of an eye.
