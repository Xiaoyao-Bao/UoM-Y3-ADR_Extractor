Muscle pain in feet, shoulders, chest muscle, arms.
Tingling in extremities and chronic fatigue.
Headache.
WHAT A PRICE TO PAY!!
I have always been athletic (no, I'm not one of those dreamers that pretends I am).
I bike 60+ miles a week, plus weight train twice a week.
Usually, I would been sore once in a while from over-doing it, but not for days on end and not in such severity.
I used a 5 pound sledge to do some work and I felt like I had severe arthritis in my right hand for at least a week and a half.
I feel very bad for those of you that didn't find out until late about this junk.
I didn't have any digestive problems, but did have the headache described, and as pointed out by others, nothing will help the pain.
I have been off this stuff for two days now, and feeling better already.
I wish you all a swift return to a high quality of life.
