This medicine completely relieves my thumb pain, and really helps with my back pain.
BUT, it makes my stomach hurt soooo bad that I'm not sure what is worse.
I only use it when my thumbs hurt so bad I want to cry.
Then I put up with the stomach pain.
It also give you diarrhea but I can handle that.
