I think I've been ok with this medication.
I was diagnosed with high cholesterol when I was 19, I'm now 38 and started on Lipitor when I was 31.
Prior to starting Lipitor my cholesterol level was 8.45(Canada),in Nov/03 my level was down to 6.24.
Its still a bit high,(Canada the levels are measured different then the US, levels should be below 5.20).
My mother and I are both recipients of high cholesterol.
I do suffer migranes, back aches sore neck.
I do exercise regualarly, but still have pains.
I am always tired, but I really don't know if this is caused by the medication.
I have never mentioned this to my doctor, because I just thought this was caused by my job and being run down with dealing with my children.
