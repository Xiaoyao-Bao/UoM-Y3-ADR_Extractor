Side effects are some drowsiness and some dry mouth.
Can take it on an empty stomach with no problem.
The drowsiness is nice and helps me sleep, as well.
Overall an excellent drug that works better than any other NSAID I've tried!.
I was surprised to find that this drug noticeably lowers my pain level after about 45 minutes.
I still have to take it in combo with a stronger pain reliever, but it's just a good drug for aches and pains.
Better than things like Vioxx and OTC stuff, for sure.
