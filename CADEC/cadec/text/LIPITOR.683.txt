Diarrhea, muscle pain, joint aches.
Lipitor did a wonderful job on my cholesterol but after about 4 weeks, I developed what I thought were strained muscles from exercise.
It seems to be getting worse.
After all I've read, I think I will stop taking this and find another alternative.
I am a type one diabetic.
