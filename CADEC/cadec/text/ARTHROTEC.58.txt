Disorentatation,trouble brathing, extreme hot, redness and swelling, itching, later abominal cramps.
All this came all sudden in couple of minutes.
I had been taking arthrotec before for my knee pain and it helped me a lot.
I only had 10-12 pills left from last March when I had a cortisone shot and my knee pain went away.
