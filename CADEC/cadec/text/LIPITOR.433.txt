My Dr increased my dose from 10 to 20mg.
Have been taking for about 4 years.
my liver readings went up' am constipated and bloated with loss of appetite.
Went off Lipitor for 2 weeks and felt great.
Now, I'm back on 10mg plus another drug.
Bloated again with headaches.
Am not a headache person.
Will wait out this week before I contact the Dr.
