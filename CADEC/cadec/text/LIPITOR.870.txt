A few years after the dosage was raised to 40 mg, I began to have a sharp pain in the ball of my right foot, diagnosed as a neuroma.
(It seemed more like metatarsalgia to me.)
Then the left foot started hurting also.
I nearly stopped walking for 6 months, hoping to get better to avoid surgery.
I stopped Lipitor as an experiment, and after 3 days the pain changed completely.
It began to heal after that.
Every week since has been a marked improvement.
After 7 weeks, it's nearly healed.
I can again hike for miles without the horrible pain I experienced for over 6 months while taking this drug.
Lipitor did control cholesterol, but isn't it really inflamation causing heart disease and stroke, and not the cholesterol?
Is everyone barking up the wrong tree here?
And what is the price of all the weird side effects no one can recognize?.
