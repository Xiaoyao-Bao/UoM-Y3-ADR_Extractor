Abdominal distention - feel full.
Gained about 5 lbs the first week.
back pain in the am, leg cramps on and off.
Weird tight feeling in my head.
Gas, insomnia, loss of muscle strength.
I have Sores on the inner cheeks.
Weird tight feeling in chest cavity at times, when exercising.
I was in otherwise good health before starting, although it's only been a week.
It should be noted that this is my third time trying this med.
I am not drinking the koolaid on this miracle drug.
I think it has major side effects that the mfgs are still not attributing to the drug.
There is a lot of good reads out there, including articles in the NY times - do some research - it seems a lot of us are on the fence.
I'm in a very high risk category, with levels over 300, a horrible ratio, and tryc through the roof.
