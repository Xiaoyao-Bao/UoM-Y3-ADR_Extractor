I took Lipitor for 6 weeks and noticed extreme dehydration and extremely dry eyes.
My eyes are so dry that they stick to the eyelids at night and I am getting microabrasions on them - very painful.
Additionally, despite eating a pure fiber diet to lower my cholesterol, the medicine has made me extremely constipated.
I have been off now for 5 days.
The constipation is starting to go away as are the dry eyes although they are still quite painful.
I have started the Blood Type Diet for my blood type (A) and will lower my cholesterol naturally since I cannot fathom being on Lipitor after my experience with it.
I would not recommend this medicine to anyone.
