I started to take 20 mg lipitor in August 2006, after 6 months, I reduced to take 10 mg, and after another 6 months, I reduced the lipitor intake to 5 mg.
During all these 18 months, my LDL and cholesterol in 70s and 120s and I did not feel much side effects.
When I incresed lipitor from 5 mg to 10 mg about 3 months ago, I started to experience the following side-effects started at different time: loss body balance, joint pain, muscle aches, weak legs, and some memory loss.
About 2 months ago while I first told my doctor I lost some body balance and it might be due to lipitor buy my doctor told me the side effect was most likely by some other reason(s).
During my second visiting him, he told me my blood test CK is 90 and my muscle should be OK.
Then I continued to take 10 mg lipitor, but I felt more on muscle and joint pain and I started to feel I lost some memory.
Therefore, I deeply believed that I had side effects by taking lipitor.
After about a week to 10 day without lipitor, I got my memory back to nomal level and my body balance is getting better.
During my third doctor visit, my doctor finally believed that I got bad side effects and he told me it would take months for recovery.
Now my doctor wants me to take B3 or Niaspan instead of lipitor.
