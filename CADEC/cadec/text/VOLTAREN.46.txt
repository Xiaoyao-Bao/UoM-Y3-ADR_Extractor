This drug MAY have caused edema of fingers and face after taking for 4 days.
Also may have caused shortness of breath.
Also some crabbiness and cramping (as in menstrual) and spotting.
Timing off for a true period, so suspect Voltaren is the culprit.
Took one 50 mg pill each day for 5 days.
The first day it seemed to make all the pain of a muscle spasm in shoulder go away.
It almost seemed like a miracle.
The effects diminished each day (I have pain almost all the time) and now my face and fingers are swollen and I am short of breath, cramping and bloated.
Interesting to see females posting similar troubles.
I will NEVER take another one of these.
