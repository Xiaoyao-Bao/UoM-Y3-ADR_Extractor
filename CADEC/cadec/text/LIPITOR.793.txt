General fatigue, aches and pains for years.
Thought it was menopause.
But recently--severe swolen/inflamation of the fingers/hands and wrist pain.
Have suffered with geneal aches and pains for years thinking very similar to alot of you, that it was just my age and I had to accept it!
I have been suffering with severe swolen/inflamation of the fingers/hand & wrist pain for 8 months and attributed it to new blood pressure medicine or arthritis; however, after going off the new blood pressure meds for 5 weeks, I have noticed no remarkable change and have had blood work and x-rays indicating NO arthritis.
But now after finding this site, I'm wondering if it has been the Lipitor all along all of a sudden after taking it for 7.5 years.
I am discontinuing the Lipitor immediately to see if I can find any change and relief.
I agree with so many of you in saying that no cholesterol lowering drug is worth this kind of result!
Thank you everyone for taking the time to write so we aren't prisoners to just our doctor's advice!.
