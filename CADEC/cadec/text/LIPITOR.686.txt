I thought I was having a heart attack - went to emergency room.
Problem began while sitting at this computer.
quick, sharp pain in center of chest, followed by a hot/heated flushing sensation that began mid-torso and continued up to the top of head (top of scalp started tingling and burning).
Oddest feeling that I've ever experienced - very scary.
Lasted approximately 45 seconds, followed by feeling of weakness and impending doom.
By the time I arrived at the hospital I was shaking with chills uncontrollably.
After tests were run I was told that it wasn't a heart attack or shroke.
They said it was probably related to stress or a panic attack -- ridiculous because I haven't been stressed and have never had any problem similar.
Definitely helped lower my cholesterol from 263 to 164 -- amazing, but I'm afraid to continue taking due to experiencing same severe side effects.
Will discuss further with my doctor.
