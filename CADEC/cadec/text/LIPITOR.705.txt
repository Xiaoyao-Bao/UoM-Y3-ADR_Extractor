severe joint pains, needed help getting out of bed and off a chair, whereas had been previously active, neck pain up to the back of the head, right knee protruding out of joint, whereas left knee remained normal, wrist and arm joints sore, red dots on skin all over body, liver function tests normal, however had all of other side effects.
Once I stopped Lipitor, side effects went away gradually.
I had a similar reaction recently to Tricor, another cholesterol lowering medication.
Had similar muscle and joint pains and decided to go off of that.
