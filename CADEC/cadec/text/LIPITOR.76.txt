59 year old female with diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure and high cholestrol/triglycerides.
Neurologist, cardiologist, and internist stated my symptoms were not all related to Lipitor side effects.
After trying Zocor, Provachol, Zetia and Crestor, Lipitor seemed to be the lessor of the evils with regard to side effects.
However, due to heart problems, cardiologist gradually increased the Lipitor dosage from 10mg to 40mg.
Symptoms have been gradual over the years with recent face and scalp problems diagnosed as trigeminal neuralgia after MRI ruled out tumor or MS.
After reading your comments regarding Liptior, I have decided to reduce the dosage from 40mg to 20mg for a week to see if this relieves the most recent symptoms.
If improvement is noted, then I will contact my doctor for a further reduction in the dosage to determine if other symptoms abate.
I appreciate all the feedback on this medication and will keep you posted on my progress.
