Severe neck/shoulder/pain, achiness, acid reflux.
I went on it for 2 months, I didn't first associate this as the muscle pains they were talking about but within 24 hours of going off of it (with my dr's blessing) I felt much better.
It did lower my cholesterol very significantly within one month.
Muscle aches cleared up quickly but acid reflux is still going strong and I didn't have it before.
