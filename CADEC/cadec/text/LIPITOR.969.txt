Severe pain in my calf muscles in my legs started about 7 months after taking the drug.
My doctor kept me on it and insisted this was a common side effect.
I complained for several months and then he switched me to another drug (Crestor) and the problems persisted.
He then switched me to (Zochor).
Finally I informed my doctor the pain was too severe and I was stopping as I found I could not even walk in the morning!
The cramps persisted for months and then I tore a tendon in my ankle and months later my knee.
I have had surgery but to no avail.
I still have some form of pain daily.
Before Lipitor I was in excellent shape and exercised regularly with no issues at all.
I have never been the same.
By the way 10Mg of Lipitor lowered my cholesterol 100 points but it was not worth it.
This drug ruined my life!.
Stop taking at first sign of muscle pain!.
