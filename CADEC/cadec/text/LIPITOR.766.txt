One week after initiating therapy, developed syncope and hypertension.
Primary care diagnosed and treated labyrinthitis.
Subsequently developed irretractable lower back pain.
Primary care treated with steroids.
Other side effects included: weight gain, periorbital edema, fatigue, lack of libido, and detachment.
My primary care never considered my symptoms may be associated with lipitor.
I learned this only after reading about side effects in the PI and on the Internet.
