Sudden knee pain 2 week into it, horriable crippeling pain hit both knees at same moment, progressed to odd painful, lumpy swelling on both feet in same place on each and a sudden horriable grabbing pain in one ankle, gas, indigestion, acid reflux, no energy, confusion, stumbeling, vertigo, memory loss, frequent sudden urges to go pee that came out with a force that sprayed everywhere.
(Off of it I now have to force it out).
Getting off cleared most up but woke up every morning with horriable pain in a different joint making it useless until it passed days later and suddenly landed in right shoulder.
MRI shows arthritis, tendonitis and burscitis when there was never any problems in that shoulder before.
Been suffering with that for almost a year.
Sudden grabbing pain in ankle comes and goes.
HORRIABLE pain that almost throws me down.
Have days where confusion comes back also.
Also my last colonscopy turned up 5 precancerous polyups.
Before statin drugs, I never had a one of them, 5 year.
This medicine is posion!
We do not know if the damage it does to us is permenant or not.
I feel like I have been cheated out of growing old naturally and will question every ailmant I have from now on as natural or statin induced.
In my whole life, I didn't see a doctor as much as I have since I started Lipitor drugs and since I have been off of it.
The doctor always brushed off my complaints or would write me a RX for another dangerous drug!
WHEN are doctors going to listen to the people are paying him to treat them and quit believing those who PROFIT from the sale of their drugs they push on unsuspecting people.
(What happened to DO NO HARM? ).
They have killed my faith in drugs, doctors and the FDA.
DOCTORS!
WAKE UP!!
THEY ARE MAKING YOU LOOK LIKE FOOLS AND IDIOTS that can be bought for a free lunch or a plate of cookies!
I also say, get those darn drug ads OFF of TV!.
