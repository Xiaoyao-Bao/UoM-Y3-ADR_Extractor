I'm not sure if this is related to the lipitor, but shortly after I started taking it, I exprienced complete paralysis in my forehead (peripheral neuropathy).
Went to a neurologist,GP and ENT, none of whom have ever seen this kind of paralysis (both sides) with no other symptoms.
Has any one else come across this symptom?
I m tempted to go off the medicine to see if the paralysis goes away.
It really lowered my cholestrol a lot, so I hope this problem isn;t related.
