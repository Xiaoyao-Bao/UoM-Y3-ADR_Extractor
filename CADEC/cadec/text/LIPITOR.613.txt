On lipitor for 4 years.
Reduced cholesterol levels to normal BUT since taking lipitor I've developed horrible pain in both shoulders and left knee.
Sleeping has become extemely difficult due to pain.
Have to sleep in a chair most nights.
Orthopedist seems to think its normal aging (I'm only 55) and internist is skeptical that lipitor is the culprit.
I have also noticed that I have short term memory loss and am easily fatigued.
After reading the entries on this site I'm stopping the lipitor today and we'll see the result.
