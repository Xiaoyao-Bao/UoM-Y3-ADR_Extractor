Severe elbow, arm and shoulder pain.
It's just a little white pill, this can't be causing all of my pain.
Boy was I wrong, this pill has caused me so much grief.
I couldn't even watch TV with my family as the pain in my arms and shoulder drove me to my bed.
I felt so old and scared that the rest of my life would be pain filled.
One week ago I ran out of lipitor and after a few days found that my arm & elbow pain subsided.
Why isn't this widely known?
I'm angry and also sad, sad that I've wasted all this time and angry that the drug companies are getting richer by the second.
