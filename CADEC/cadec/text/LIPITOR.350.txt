Very Painful feet for past 3 weeks and lower legs now starting to hurt.
Can hardly walk without higher pain level.
I stopped Lipitor for a few days before now and the pain did not subside.
I now know from this site that it takes longer to recover then a few days.
This has caused me to miss out on my Summer Vacation with Family.
