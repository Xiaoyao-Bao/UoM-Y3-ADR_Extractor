The worst gas I've ever experienced!
I mean smelly and painfull! Diarhea, headache, backache, runny nose.
1 week on 40mg.
Am stopping it now before anything else happens!.
Why did my doctor start me on such a high dose?
No warning of these side effects- I mean the gas and bloat is so bad I can't go to work.
