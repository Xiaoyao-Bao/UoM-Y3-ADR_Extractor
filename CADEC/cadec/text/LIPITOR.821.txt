my partner is currently taking this medication liptor, he also takes high blood pressure medication, my reason for initally looking for side effects of liptor was because of my partners decreased libido and to see if there is a connection between this and the medication, however i noticed a small number of people are suffering in this way, i cannot believe the amount of things that are causing such a big problem for so many people taking this drug, my partner is normally very muscular as works out twice a week and has done for years, but over the last 6mths or so seems to have lost a lot of muscle and replacedit with fat, especially around the midrif, he also suffers from regular dioreaha and muscle pain in back and just below shoulder blades, very often also suffers from headaches, doesnt sleep very well at night at all,also gets tired a lot , my partner isnt aware of this website but i will be definetly showing this to him and advising him to perhaps stop taking this medication for a few weeks to see what the difference is , so glad to have found this site.
my partner is 40.
