I have been on Arthrotec for a year and a half and have been very pleased that it does help deal with my back pain.
However.
over the last six months, I have started having vaginal bleeding almost every day of the month.
Lots of clotting, and horrible periods.
I went to the obgyn and everything came out normal.
The doc put me on birth control.
But, the bleeding has not subsided.
So now I am scheduled to have an endometrial biopsy on Wed.
I had an ephiphany last night about Arthrotec and began researching the side effect.
When I came across this website, I was appalled that the majority of the females mention heavy/extra vaginal bleeding.
I firmly believe this is the answer to my bleeding problem and will be telling the doctor on Monday,.
Although this drug has helped with the pain, it is not worth the cost and hassle of bleeding constantly.,
On top of that, I am now having to have a procedure that a 31 year old should not have to endure.
I truly hope that there are no long term effects from this.
I have not taken Arthrotec in almost a week, yet I am still bleeding.
I do not look forward to the extra pains I will llkely experience in a couple weeks, but I am sure I can find something else to deal with them.
I feel that I have become dependent on this medicine to function.
