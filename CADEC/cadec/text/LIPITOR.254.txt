Initially minor muscle pain but thought it was due to my working out.
After two years of use - SEVERE muscle pain in sholder and hip joints - random fluish feeling (minor muscle achs all over)- random low energy.
Within two weeks of this sudden increase in pain, I was waking me up at night in pain.
Pain immediately declined within a few days of stopping lipitor.
Won't touch it.
I don't know how long it will take for my muscles to heal now.
