Prescribed it for High Cholesterol (just under 6)
Within 2 weeks had sore feet (Faciitis) and continued to get worse.
Hands, fingers, wrists, lumbar and AC joints, dry mouth, hair falling out.
Dr diagnosed it as autoimmune polyarthritis and wanted me to start anti-inflammatories for the pain.
Took one and couldn't stand the side effects so stopped immediately.
After researching at night because I couldn't sleep, thought maybe the Lipitor might be the problem.
Stopped taking it immediately (3 days ago) and already I can move my feet and ankles.
Not hobbling around and can get out of bed without assistance.
Hands still sore but have some movement back in my fingers.
Hoping this will continue to improve given more time off the drug.
This drug is poisionous.
I haven't felt well since I started taking Lipitor.
The fatigue was as bad as the pain in my joints, if not worse.
Today is the first day I haven't needed to rest during the day and I am hoping this will improve as time passes.
What the hell is in this god forsaken drug?!.
