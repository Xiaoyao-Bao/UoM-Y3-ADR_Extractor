Severe pain in both calfs and thighs.
I became unable to lift my legs to put on my pants or even get in the car.
This developed after being on the Lipitor for about 5 years.
I was on 10 mg and complained about discomfort in my legs but my cardiologist just said it was old age and even upped my dose to 20 mg.
That really made things a lot worst and now I just stopped it and within 24 hours could see an improvement.
Incidently I am a physician and was aware of the myalgia with Lipitor but I suspect it is much worst than the drug company would have you believe.
This is really a very toxic drug and should be used with caution.
This is a drug which is very effective in lowering cholesterol but also affects many metabolic pathways in the body and is potentially dangerous.
