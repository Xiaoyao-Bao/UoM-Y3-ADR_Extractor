I had diarrhea, severe abdominal pain which was constant for 4 hours straight, vomiting, trembling, dizziness, nausea.
Arthrotec seemed to induce my menstrual cramps and cause the pain to be severe.
I would not recommend this drug to anyone, especially since I have never had such an adverse reaction to any other medication.
Also, I would caution women not to take this medication while menstruating, since one side effect can be severe menstual pain.
