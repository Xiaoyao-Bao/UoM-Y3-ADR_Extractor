vaginal bleeding and cramping 2 years after menopause.
While this helped some with the joint pain, I was unpleasantly surprised at the return of my period after 2 years.
I had severe endometriosis and adenomyosis all my life, plus the impairment in blood clotting due to EDS, so my doctor probably should not have prescribed this drug.
I'm not taking any more tablets.
Cymbalta 120 mg per day helps enough with the pain.
