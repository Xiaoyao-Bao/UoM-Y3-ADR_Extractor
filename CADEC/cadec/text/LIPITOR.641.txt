I took Lipitor for about 2 months two years ago and it completely changed my life.
My muscles and nerves have suffered from this.
I have been diagnosed with fatty liver, leaky heart valves, goiter, neuropthy in both feet since that time.
Before I stopped the Lipitor I ended up in the ER with a pulse of 156 and chest pains.
I was a nail tech and needless to say that will never be again with the weakness in my arms.
I would not give this to my worse enemy.
