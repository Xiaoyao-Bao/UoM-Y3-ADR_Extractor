Did reduce cholesterol but after 18 months suddenly developed muscle cramps and tendon pain everywhere - feet, knees, shins, thigh,hips, upper arms, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hands, tightened muscles in neck which aggravted spinal disc sysmptoms in areas where I have had problems in the past.
In great acute pain doing most things.
Living hell.
Gave up Lipitor for 5 weeks and symptoms rapidly improved.
Started taking again and day 1 had very severe cramps and pains again all over everwhere at once, these faded slightly so I thought I would try another - same very severe reaction.
No question in my mind that it is the culprit.
