legs feel leaden, initially, lower back pain (but I've had that before), cramps in thighs, achy legs, lack of energy.
More problems with my sinuses.
Woke up with severe vertigo, but it may be due to a cold virus.
However, I've never had it before with a cold.
Severe gas, and intestinal distention.
Constipation.
I take other medications.
Some for high blood pressure, and thyroid medication.
However, I didn't have side effects from any of those medications.
When I started Lipitor, Immediately had lower back pain, then pain in my thighs (muscle cramping).
It doesn't seem to matter what foods I eat, I always get distention and gas while on this drug.
This is an unpleasant (for everyone near me) side effect.
Since my Dr is out of town, and I've only been on the medication for 6 weeks (10mg), I'm stopping it until I get in to see her.
I've also had very different cholesterol readings over the years, and am skeptical that any given time you go in for a blood test, it could be very different.
It's just that my last one was high (275!) But sometimes it's 170.
And it's also been borderline for many years, around 200.
(with the good cholesterol very good).
I think it's higher these days, because I've been in menopause longer.
But I wonder if side effects to any drug aren't a message that.
