Weight gain, extreme muscle aches and fatigue, alternating constipation and diarrhea, more frequent asthma flare-ups, insomnia, weird dreams.
I had to walk with a cane because I was so weak and ached all over, especially in legs.
My husband and I took ourselves off this medication 10 days ago.
I can't tell you how much better we both feel off Lipitor.
I sleep better, don't need to use my cane, and can bend and move better after just 10 days off the medicine.
DON'T TAKE LIPITOR--try garlique or a natural remedy.
Lipitor hurts more than it helps.
