Muscle pain.
Severe joint pain in the shoulders and knees.
Pain and cramping in my hands and lower legs.
Numbness in all of my finger tips and toes.
Wake up on and off all night long due to numbness in my hands and pain in shoulders some nights worse than others.
I've been off lipitor since 7/1/04 and the muscle pain is gone and my knees are almost back to my norm.
Both of my shoulders are still very messed up.
Have constint shoulder pain more in the left than the right.
Still have finger and hand numbness on and off all day and night.
Worse at night.
But even these pains are a lot less now then they were while on lipitor.
I'm hoping that there is not any perminent damage.
While first taking lipitor and I noticed these changes I told my doctor and he told me that this had nothing to do with the lipitor.
It was just age.
