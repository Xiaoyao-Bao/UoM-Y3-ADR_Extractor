No side effects.
My doctor (conservative and top-rate) says that taking Lipitor is a no brainer .
All advantages, no disadvantages.
And for me that's true.
My cholesterol fell to 160 and I've had no side effects.
My husband and I buy 20 mg tablets and use pill-splitter to cut in half.
Costs much less!.
