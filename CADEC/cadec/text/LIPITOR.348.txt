Definitely short term memory issues, but I'm 44 and I suppose it could be part of menopause on its way.
lowered overall cholesterol and my hdl went up to 59 from 35, and triglycerides went down but not enough.
LDL down too but not enough so taking higher dose now.
Worked like a champ at 10 mg for first two years.
Now switched from GP to cardiologist and he's upped it to 40 mg so will see.
have only taken 3 tablets since new dosage.
