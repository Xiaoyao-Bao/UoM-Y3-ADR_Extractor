Muscle aches.
now have fibromyalgia.
Memory, learning problems, brain fog, depression, extreme fatigue.
In horrible pain, I quit taking it and replaced it with natural therapies.
Starting to feel better.
I hope and pray the damage isn't permanent.
This medication is nothing but a pharmaceutical money maker.
It should be banned!!
I wish I would have known the side effects when I started taking it, instead of dealing with extreme pain for so many years!.
