Doctor gave me a prescription for a year's worth of Lipitor.
I took it for four months and asked for a retest before renewing my prescription.
In four months, my cholesterol dropped 100 points, HDL and LDL were in better, though not perfect balance.
With my cholesterol at 139, I declined to take more Lipitor.
Got HDL and LDL into perfect balance within another two months using certain over-the-counter amino acids, tocotrienols, and other nutrients I found online that supposedly do the job.
They do!
And the nice thing is, if my cholesterol goes up again, I know that very low dose of Lipitor will take care of it.
Good stuff!.
