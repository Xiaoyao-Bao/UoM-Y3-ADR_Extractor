i have experienced extreme stomach pain when taken on an empty stomach, and moderate stomach pain when taken with food.
i also had some drowsiness after taking arthrotec.
arthrotec works very well for my knee pain, more so than mobic or celebrex.
however, i do experience stomach pain from time to time.
