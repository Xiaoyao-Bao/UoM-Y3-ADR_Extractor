Slowly worsening muscle weakness and fatigue in arms(where hardest daily work occurs).
Strained or pulled a muscle at the time period of greatest weakness.
Stopped taking Lipitor after reading about possible side effects(was never told by MD)in newspaper.
Muscle strength recovered after 3 to 4 weeks.
Pulled muscle still will not heal after 9 months.
Have a friend also with a physically demanding job who thought he was just getting old with his weak muscles.
Guess what he was taking?.
