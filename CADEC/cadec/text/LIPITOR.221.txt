OK for 4 years, then muscle cramps, spasms, weakness in legs and right hand progressed to atrophy.
Foggy mental state, falling over,clumsiness,nightmares,dry mouth.
Stopped taking Lipitor in April 2006 and rapidly improved, but a month later started going downhill again and have now been diagnosed with ALS.
I am an unlikely candidate for MND.
I know the Lipitor poisoned me.
I wish I had stopped taking this poison before it caused permanent nerve damage.
