I just had a blood test done as part of a routine physical.
Some values indicate liver disease.
Wondering if it is from Lipitor.
Has anyone else out there developed liver damage from Lipitor.
Please e-mail me.
Lipitor seems to work, but I am very concerned about the side effects now.
I have been taking Lipitor probably over 5 years.
Also have experienced leg cramps, mental confusion, but thought it was just the aging process.
