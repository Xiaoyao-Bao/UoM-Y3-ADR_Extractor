I had no side effects the first two days.
The doctor prescribed for me to take 2 per day and I'm very glad I didn't.
I took one per day and this is the third day.
My face has felt numb most of the day and I feel light headed.
I've had to get up and walk this feeling off, which has not been fun on the knee.
I wouldn't suggest voltaren because it did nothing for the inflammation in the knee and has me in a panic until I can get this stuff out of my system.
