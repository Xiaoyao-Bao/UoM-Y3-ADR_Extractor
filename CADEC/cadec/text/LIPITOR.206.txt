Debilitating muscle and joint pain, swelling of feet and hands, numbness and tingling in feet and hands, headaches, fatigue, blurred vision.
Stopped taking it 7 days ago but the pain + other symptoms are not getting any better (all except blurred vison, that went away after 3 days off Lipitor).
I am scared of permanet damage.
I really really hope it is reversible, because I can't walk or do anything with my hands.
