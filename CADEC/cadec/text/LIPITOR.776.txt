Eczema on hands and feet, rash on upper left torso, depression.
Cholesterol at 312.
Stopped taking after 6 days and depression lifted a few days later.
Took 2 weeks for eczema outbreak to subside.
Started taking an herbal cholesterol formula by Dr Sinatra and eating oatmeal everyday.
8 weeks after stopping lipitor was retested and cholesterol dropped to 255.
obviously not from lipitor but from changes in diet and supplements.
doc want to try lower dosage but i am hesitant.
i'm staying on new diet and supplements for now.
retest in 30 days to see how effective.
trying to avoid statins at all cost.
doc is very insistant, almost as if he's getting a kickback.
we'll see.
