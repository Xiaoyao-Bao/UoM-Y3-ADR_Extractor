I am female, age 55 and generally in good health.
No smoking or drinking and work daily.
Wt is 15 lbs more than it should be.
Cholesterol has been high for years despite diet.
Taking 40mg daily for 1 year, took 20mg previously.
Lately I realized everything hurts.
It crept up on me.
I am an RN and still did not put it together until this week when I decided something is not right.
When the aches and pains were mild I thought it was arthritis or too much activity.
Stopped the Lipitor and the generalized aches and pains are fading after just 3 days.
Will explore other options but these drugs have not been around long enough to confirm long term effects.
Looking at this site, I will begin to ask my patients that are on statins about their history.
