Extreme muscle problems and joint pain.
In only one day of taking lipitor I nearly died.
I was 45 years old when I took lipitor.
Terrible mistake.
My son almost died after taking lipitor for two months.
His liver was functioning at only 50% and he was saved by being admitted into the hospital for 3 days.
His cholestrol went up dramatically not down.
