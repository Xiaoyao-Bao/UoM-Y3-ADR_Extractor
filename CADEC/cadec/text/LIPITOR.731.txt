I've been on Lipitor for a couple of weeks now.
I've been having muscle fatigue/soreness in my forearms for about a week and now have sore cheek muscles in my face.
It just dawned on me that my doctor mentioned something about muscle problems and am wondering if this could be the cause.
I will find out soon.
