This med worked wonders for me.
Am only gratefull to the pharmaceutical company that makes it.
My lipids are at normal level in the past 2 H1C tests.
As adiabetic you are at higher risk for stroke and heart attack so taking Lipitor defininitely lowers the risk.
No side effects.
Expensive medicine but luckily my insurance covers it.
