None Maybe I'm just lucky.
I went from 80mg zocor to 40 then 80 mg lipitor all with no discernible side effects.
Without statins my TC is around 300, with 80 mgm lipitor it is a consistent 140.
Nothing else worked to bring it down and I nearly died with 99% blockage of the LAD before an angioplasty and going on statins.
Both my grandfather and father dropped dead in their early sixties.
For me, this is a wonder drug.
