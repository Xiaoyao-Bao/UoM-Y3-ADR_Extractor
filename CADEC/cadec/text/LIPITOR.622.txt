Made a BIG improvement in cholesterol and triglycerides, but in the three years I've been on it have had extreme fatigue, muscle weakness, depression.
In recent months I've had chronic elbow pain in both arms.
It just occurred to me that it might be the Lipitor and this site has convinced me.
I just threw away a bottle with 10 pills remaining and am going to continue with my diet and exercise.
Hope my energy level returns.
