After taking the drug for 7 years, i've suddenly developped diarrhea, nausea, loss of apetite, stomach cramps.
I've had these symptoms for 4 weeks and i've just realised it could be side effects from arthotec.
The problem is if i stop arthrotec I become paralysed by back pain.
Seeing the doctor next week.
But not sure if my symptoms are due to the drug as i've been on it for so long with no side effects.
After trying several NSAIDs with side effects, I finally discovered arthrotec which relieved the pain and no side effects.
I usually take 1 or 2 a day and when the pain gets really bad increase it to 3 a day for one or two weeks.
