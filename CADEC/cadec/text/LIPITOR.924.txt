I never had any side effects.
I'm taking 20mgs of lipitor a day.
I can't recall when i started taking it.
Its been a few years.
Last year my cholesterol went back to normal on lipitor.
The doctor says i'll have to take lipitor for the rest of my life.
That is what i don't like.
Drug dependancy is a bad thing.
