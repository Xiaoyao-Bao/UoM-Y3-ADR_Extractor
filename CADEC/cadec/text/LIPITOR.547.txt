Does not appear to be giving me negative side effects.
My ordeal began with leg problems long before my bypass and any drugs were taken.
After surgery I was given list of drugs of which Lipitor was one.
I take 80mg./day at night along with asprin, 100mg of Atenolol and a host of others.
Sorry to say my leg pains have not went away, and by reading many of these postings it appears to exaggerate this condition.
Doctors looking elsewhere but have found nothing.
I found information about leg pains being caused by restless leg syndrome.
I sure hope I don't have that!
Started at 262, after 8 months down to 108.
Lipitor diet and excercise have lowered my cholestrol.
