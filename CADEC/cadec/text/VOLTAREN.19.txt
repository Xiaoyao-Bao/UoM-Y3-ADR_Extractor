none whatsoever.
I started taking voltaren twice a day and then switched to once a day which pretty much takes away all my pain.
However, I have read so much on the side effects that I now only take it once or twice a week.
I am 68 and if I take it every day I feel like a 25 yr old.
It also takes care of all my arthritis pain as well.
I love it and wish it didn't have so many side effects.
