two years of hell, several doctors, many mri's,many emg's for the nerves sensitivity,muscles pains, lead legs.
I never stopped searching for an answer and not one doctor picked it up even though that's the first question they ask you.
What medicines do you take?
Now all they want to do is push more meds, i am taking neurontin,oxycotin, zanax, and celebrex.
BEWARE.
