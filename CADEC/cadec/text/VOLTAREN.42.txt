It's not clear that there were any.
I'm concerned that I'm imagining them because of the long list of potential side effects.
Medicine is scary, but it's sure working.

This drug was prescribed to help with severe knee pain while I wait for additional diagnostics and possibly surgery after 1/1 (due to high deductible on health insurance).
Pain was bad enough that I had trouble standing up from sitting position.
After about 24 hours, the pain was essentially gone and has stayed gone so far.
