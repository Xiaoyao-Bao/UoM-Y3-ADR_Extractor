muscle wasting in the shoulders and arms,nerve problems in shoulder , fatigue and very sensative to the cold.
started on 10mg raised to 20.
numbers are great with the bloods but symtoms gradually got worse.
ive just stopped taking them,going to start high dose fish oil,coenzyme10,vit c and alpha lipoic acid and see what the next bloods say,please note other meds were taken at the same time as the lipitor- ramipril and metoptolol &acid reducers for gout,so anybodies guess?.
