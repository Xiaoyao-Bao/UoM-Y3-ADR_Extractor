SUDDENLY one morning as I arose from a chair I received a sudden severe pain close to my the crotch area.
Could barely move.
Then the other side became painful.
I crawled up and down stairs and could barely walk;had to use a cane.
AND I had been healthy and active prior to Lipitor.
Enlarged liver was the result of a blood test.
Was taken off Lipitor, immediately, pain lessened, but muscles had become weak and stressed.
Given 18 sessions of physical therapy, before body returned to comfortable gait.
Pain free ever since.
Cannot take any statins ever again.
Was put on Zetia, taken off recently,1 1/2 year later.
