I only took 20 mg daily for 2 weeks - several days after stopping my toes went into muscle spasms.
Don't know it there was any connection.
After only 2 weeks on Lipitor, my total cholesterol fell from 306 to 178; LDL fell from 178 to 70; and, my HDL went from 116 to 89 (didn't like this result, but did like the change in the LDL).
Overall the results were significant.
I will start taking it again as my cardiologist has encouraged me to stay on the medication.
After reading many of the comments in this website, I will remain cautious and look for side effects.
Thank you to all the people who took the time to write and to the people who set up this website.
Will write again after taking it for a couple of months.
