Some stomach sensitivity.
I am taking it only 1 time per day because of the possible side effects.
Without this drug I was severly restricted and could only walk less than 100 meters.
With the drug I can walk 1/2 km and function.
I am thinking of increasing it to twice per day and/or getting surgery and/or epidural steroid injection.
