It began with stomach pain,then slight nausea, then reflux each time I took a pill.
After the second pill the same progression of symptoms only now the abdominal gas,cramps and pain would be with me all day.
I stopped pills but abdominal cramps persist.
The only good thing I can say about Arthrotec is that I did notice pain relief but I won't put up with the side effects on a daily basis since I spent a long time getting rid of a reflux problem in the past.
The abdominal gas,cramps and discomfort are another thing I don't want to see get worse if I keep taking Arthrotec.
I've taken Tylenol 3 and never had a problem like this.
Perhaps there is something not right yet with Arthrotec.
