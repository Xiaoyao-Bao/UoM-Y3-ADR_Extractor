HEADACHE, BUT MOSTLY SWELLING OF THE LEGS AND FEET.
HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE.
BLADDER INFECTION .
I STOPPED TAKING ONCE I REALIZED THE SWELLING I WAS HAVING WAS DUE TO THIS MED.
HAD A VERY BAD BLADDER INFECTION AND FOUND OUT IT CAN CAUSE THE BLADDER NOT TO EMPTY AS IT SHOULD.
IT DID NOT HELP WITH MY PAIN AS WELL AS ALEVE DOES.
I WISH I HAD READ THE SIDE EFFECTS OF IT BEFORE TAKING IT.
SOME OF THEM REALLY SCARED ME ONCE I DID READ THEM.
