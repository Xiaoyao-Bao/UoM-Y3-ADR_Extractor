I was experiencing lower back pain & noticed my spouse had some arthrotec 50mg anti inflammatory pills left.
So i read about it online then decided to take one.
Then about 20mins later i had MAJOR menstrual cramps & started bleeding.
i had rlly bad sickness & ended up puking.
.
thank god i got the pill out my system, the pain stopped 10mins later but i am still menstrating.
This drug cant be good for you if it brought my period on when ive only just finished my last cycle 10 dyas prior to taking the drug!
I would not reccomend taking this drug if it hasnt been suggested by your physician.
I wont be making that mistake again!.
