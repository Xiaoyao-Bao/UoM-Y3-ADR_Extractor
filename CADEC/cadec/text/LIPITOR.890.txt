muscle pain/inability to walk with left foot pain.
Memory loss.
overall loss of muscle tone.
Unable to control weight.
Try to get a cardiologist to listen to you regarding symptoms.
Called Pfizer and talked with nurse there and she recommended I let my doctor know about symptoms.
She explained that drug was mfg in USA.
My concern was that maybe some of the drug was mfg outside of USA, like maybe China and that a portion of the formula was causing problems.
But in general the whole formula is poison so far as I am concerned.
Thank God for this website.
Am seeing new GP this week, and if he doesn't take me off Lipitor, am going to do it myself.
Will take my chances rather than live this hell any longer.
Have been on Lipitor for 6 years too long.
