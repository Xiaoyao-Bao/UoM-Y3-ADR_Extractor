I am amazed to find all the people who have experienced hip/knee/ankle pain, and back pain, after taking Lipitor.
It never occured to me that the pain began around the time I started taking Lipitor, when I was 36.
I started to feel 40 years older with all the pain I experienced.
Stopped taking 2 days ago, hopefully will see improvement.
