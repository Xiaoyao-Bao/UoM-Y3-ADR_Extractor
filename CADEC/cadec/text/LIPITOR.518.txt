Tight throat, holding water.
Second time I am trying to live with Lipitor.
First time was bad, I went with another product which sent me to the emergency room twice, it suffocated me.
Then I switched to another one which was worse then the second one, kidneys hurt, bladder infection, black outs.
Now I'm back on 20mg Lipitor and will take them regardless of side effects.
I have low tolerance to any medications, taking the Lipitor at night so I sleep through most side effects.
