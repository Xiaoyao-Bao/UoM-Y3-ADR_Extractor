Back, hip thigh, knee pain, which is affecting my gait.
Memory loss.
I almost forgot(did I say memory loss?).
fatigue.
As the dose increases the pain has worsened.
I have been on Lipitor for probably 10 yrs.
Have tried nearly all statins with similar side effects.
10 mg no real side effects, no real benefits either; 40 mgs- fatigue, muscle aches but able to tolerate it though not happy and still no appreciable change in cholesterol.
now on 80 mg and feeling extremely uncomfortable.
Why am I on 80 mg?
because the insurance company required a trial at this high level, before I can switch to an alternative and reduce the dose back to 40 mg.
Since when did the insurance company go to med school so they can dictate what I should be on.
sorry for the rant.
