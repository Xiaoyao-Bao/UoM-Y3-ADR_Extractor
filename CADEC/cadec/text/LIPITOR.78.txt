Not much -- occasional itchiness.
I was taking Red Yeast statins for chlolesterol of 230, but then big-pharma got in the picture and made that illegal.
Don't know if that is still the case.
My doctor said Lipitor was the most tested statin drug.
My real concern is heart disease which is in my family.
Not sure of how tight the correlation is between low chlosterol numbers and low risk of coronary problems.
AMA dumbs down the information to make is sound like getting down to ridiculous levels (100) insures that you won't have problems.
I doubt it.
Probably much more based on genetic history.
So Lipitor is great for reducing your numbers, but extending your life ???.
