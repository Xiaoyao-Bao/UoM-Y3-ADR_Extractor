The first day I took Lipitor I couldn't sleep at night because I couldn't relax.
It was like Restless Leg Syndrome.
The second day I got very weak, shaky, and had a cold sweat in the evening.
Had chills till I went to bed.
Third day was fine.
Fourth day was a repeat of the second day, only worse.
I quit taking it then.
