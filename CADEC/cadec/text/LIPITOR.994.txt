dosage was increased from 10 to 20 mg and the tingling and numbness in my feet and shins escalated.
I even went to a podiatrist because my toes ached and my feet hurt.
I've tried simvastatin, provastatin, and lovastatin.
Each time the side effects return.
I can't even sleep at night because of the sensations of tingling in my legs and feet.
No more statins for me.
Does anyone else have the pain in their toes, feet and shins?.
