Once I had bad nausea due to taking it on an empty stomach.
Also causes bleeding problems.
Stops migraine immediately when taken early on when all others didn't.
If I wait I have to take two doses.
Easy to take - a powder in a small amount of water.
It is an anti-inflammatory, not a hypnotic.
My insurance only pays for 4 doses a month, less than I need, and paying for it without insurance is too expensive.
