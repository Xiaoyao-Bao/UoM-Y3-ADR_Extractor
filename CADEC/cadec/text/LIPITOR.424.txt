I had no side effects until I started drinking Grapefruit juice.
Then I felt like crap and stopped taking the Lipitor.
Now I'm off the grapefruit juice and back on the Lipitor and I feel great again.
Do NOT drink Grapefruit juice while taking Lipitor!
Check the label.
Grapefruit juice blocks the action of an enzyme that clears your bllodstream of the drug.
Without the enzyme, blood levels of Lipitor can get very high and cause toxic reactions.
