I have been taking simvostatin for about 5 years,,since March 2010 i have been experiencing pain in my left leg and foot with exteem pain in my ankle and at times i have had dificultly in walking to the point were on some days i could not walk at all because the pain was so bad also had pain in my left arm as if i had strained it lifting but i havn't been lifting, this is not like me because i am normaly very fit and i love walking.
doctor refered me to hostpital for xray on my foot which proved normal, after reading some of the threads on here i decided not to take my nightly statin (20m.gr.)
Since i decided to give them a miss i find that the pain in my foot is subsiding and i can walk a lot better.
i never had this problen with my foot and arm untill i took this drug,I mentioned this to my doctor who said in not many words that i should have no side effects from simvostatin.
well i have proved him wrong.
I can only hope that having taken this drug for 5 years that not to much d.
