After taking Lipitor for 5 years: pain in the knees and feet, neck and shoulders, abdominal pain and elbow pain.
I recently completed 12 physical therapy sessions for severe and chronic tendonitis in my elbows and was released with no improvement.
After searching the internet and reading comments from others who've taken Lipitor, I believe this drug has caused the severe pain I've experienced over the past 3 years.
Countless MRIs and other tests have revealed no cause for the pain.
