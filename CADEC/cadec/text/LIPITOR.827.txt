right hand tremor, affected gait--small steps, hunched over position, slowness in movement,.
I think lipitor therapy of 4+ yrs cauased parkinson's diagnosis.
i wonder if there is a genetic component related to this--if some people with genetic variability suffered an interaction with statin (as the environmental agent) to produce this neurodegenerative disease.
however rarely this occurs, given taht there are millions of people taking this class of drugs, if it is due to genetic variability, there could be enormous numbers of people suffering from neuro symptoms.
i have heard from people who think their amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is due to statins, and from people who think their parkinson/s is due to statins.
others have questioned the diagnosis of alzheimer's and the use of aa statin.
given taht these 3 neurodegenerative diseases are thought to be due to the same underlying molecular pathology, it is not a far fetched question--do statins indue neurodegenerative diseases in susceptible individuals?????.
