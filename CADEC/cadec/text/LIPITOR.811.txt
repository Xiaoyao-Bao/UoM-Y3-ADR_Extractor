My husband was on 10 mg for several years.
increasing muscle pain in legs, right hip, depression.
Went to 20 mgs and had heart palpitations and more severe pain.
Thank, God, we went on a 10-day vacation.
He forgot his Lipitor and pain decreased dramatically.
We were able to make the connection.
I want to shoot his doctor.
When we returned from vaction he tried to start his dose and experienced flu-like symtoms and all-over muscle pain.
Get off of it if you can.
