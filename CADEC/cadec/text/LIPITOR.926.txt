muscle pain and weakness, headaches, sleep disturbances.
Have been on this drug for about 3 years but for the last 18 months I've been having problems with various muscles.
Started with my SI joints.
lots of pain in the muscles there, very tight.
Then my neck started getting stiff and the muscles are like boards they're so tight.
Now the pain has gone into my shoulder and upper arm on my left side.
Just last week I noticed my right arm is tight also.
I can't sleep on either shoulder now.
My lower back is also tight again!
And I get terrible headaches from the tight neck muscles.
I googled muscle pain and Lipitor showed up on the first 6 or 7 entries!!
I read all the comments on this page and couldn't believe it!!
I see my symptoms over and over!
So, I had blood tests done this week and have elevated creatine so was told today to stop Lipitor immediately, and will see my doctor next week.
After reading all these comments, I have no doubt that Lipitor is the cause of all this discomfort.
I just hope and pray that I can recover from these terrible side effects.
I will use vitamin C and other natural things to help my cholesterol.
but if that doesn't help.
hey.
I'd rather die from a heart attack than die a slow painful death on Lipitor.
I think drugs are released on the market these days without enough long-term clinical studies to make sure they are safe.
