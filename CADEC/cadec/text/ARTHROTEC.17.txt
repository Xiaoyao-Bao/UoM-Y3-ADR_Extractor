just took the drug about 30 minutes ago and am now experiencing the worst abdominal pain ever, like mentstrual cramps/diarreah cramping combined.
i had to keep dropping into a crouched position due to the severity of the lower abdominal pain.
i was put on this medication because i was taking such high doses of Advil to quell the inflammation in my neck and back muscles that it caused me to have a GI bleed.
but after this little episode, and after reading that it can cause heavy menstrual bleeding, i highly doubt this drug is the best fit for my problem!!
i already have anemia due to the gastric bleed.
how could my doctor not think of this?
i'm also starting to feel dizzy and light headed, and can feel acidic bile at the back of my throat.
great!!
