within 24 hrs i was having direar, severe muscle aces, headace, collapades in the floor on the third day, called the dr, went back he did a liver test and took me off the medicane, but was still having symptoms, in 5 days i had blisters on my finger and palms of my hands, and on the soles of my feet, the blisters lasted 1 and a half years, my hands and feet would bleed, i saw another dr and he did tell me it was because of the lipitor, till this day i am still having problems, i still have muscle aces, memory loss, i don,t think my kidney,s are as good, i fell like my body is being attacked in different places in seems to come and go about every three weeks, i will have severe headaces, this has been 3 years ago, i think it did perment damage to me, some times i wonder when i am going to die, i forget things all the time, and even forgot how to get to the dr,s office once, i even forget my grandaughter name from time, im only 52 years of age, to young to have all this problems, iam so.
always find a alternative, if you have lipitor trash it.
