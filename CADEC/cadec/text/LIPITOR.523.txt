After 4 uneventful years on Lipitor, I started having intense shoulder and upper arm pain.
If I don't stop the Lipitor, what will happen?
Is this life-threatening?.
Why aren't we told about the consequences of various side effects of Lipitor, so we can evaluate whether to continue with the drug?
Why doesn't the product literature mention the possible effects of Lipitor on cognitive function?.
