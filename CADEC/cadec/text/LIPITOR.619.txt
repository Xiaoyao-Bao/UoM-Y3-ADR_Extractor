Terrible pain in hips and shoulders.
After taking Lipitor for a year, I started having pain in my hip.
Told Dr about it, he didn't seem to concerned.
After about 1 1/2 years I started having pain in my shoulders.
The pain is so bad at this point that it wakes me up at night and extremely limits the use of my arms.
Dr sent me for x-rays, MRI, to see an orthopedic surgeon.
All results negative.
They suggested it could be tendonitis or avascular necrosis and recommended anti-inflammatories.
Nobody ever suggested it could be the drug until I found this site doing research on my pain.
It makes me wonder how powerful these drug companies are that doctors won't even suggest that the drug could be the problem.
I'm stopping this drug today in the hopes that the pain goes away.
Hopefully I'll be able to play catch with my boys and swing a golf club again some day.
If I die of a heart attack from high cholesteral in 20 years, so be it.
I'd rather have a shorter life that I enjoy than a long life of pain.
