I had been taking two tablets per day (one @ breakfast time ,the other @ dinner time) for a couple of years when I was alerted to possible long term side effects & then consulted my GP who advised because of the time I had been taking them to only take them on a "need to basis".
I immediately stopped completely but found that I had muscular pains all over my body,I have now reduced my intake to one per day @ breakfast time & find that this has proved a moderately succesful outcome.
