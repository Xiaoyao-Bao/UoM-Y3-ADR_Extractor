Numbness started in left toe & went to right toe then went to all toes.
Burning feet especially at night.
I was on Lipitor about 2 years when this started.
It went to all of my feet.
My dr wanted to keep me on lipitor but when I quit taking I got better gradually.
I really had to fight my dr to get him to believe that lipitor was causing this.
He put me on another statin after a month of not taking Lipitor and the same thing started to happen.
I am now taking herbs for my cholesterol and it is still high but going lower and my feet are doing better.
Drug co should inform doctors of these problems so they will understand them when their patients come to them for help and.
I found that all statins cause this problem and the drug companies should help rather than hide the problems.
