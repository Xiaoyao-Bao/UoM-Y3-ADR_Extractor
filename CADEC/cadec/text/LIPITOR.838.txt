I have never been so miserable in my life.
Started out with severe back spasms, then had intense pain in my knees and spasms all throughout my legs.
Weakness in my right arm.
The worst of all was feeling like I was walking through waist-deep mud, I simply could not walk.
Extreme anxiety as well.
I had no idea what an evil poison this is.
My doctor never told me any of the side effects but since then I have learned of so many people with the same problems.
Taking 200 mg/day of COQ10 has helped immensely as well as the potassium of bananas.
