Swollen and stiff knees and elbows, mental distress, others that I am now only becoming aware of after reading many of these others testimonials.
After being on Lipitor for 2 years my knees and elbows were getting increasingly stiff and sore.
I'm a painter by trade and largely attributed it to over use of my joints.
Repetitive stress syndrome.
I went to my doctor, he sent me to an arthritis specialist, I had x-rays.
nothing was found.
I felt like an old (older) man during this period, I thought I was finished in terms of my trade and the things I enjoy most, like hiking.
My prescription of lipitor ran out a few months after these tests were done.
I didn't bother refilling it right away and noticed my knees and elbows felt better.
I renewed the prescription and no sooner had I started taking it again that I felt the stiff joints return.
So I stopped taking it, the stiffness goes away, started again, stiffness returns.
After telling my doctor this story, right away he says oh yeah, that's probably right Pardon!?
So why didn't you mention that possibility before all the tests?
(luckily since I live in Canada, these tests were all covered by our health care system) I didn't make the connection to lipitor earlier because stiff, swollen joints were not listed as one of the side effects.
Sore muscles yes, stiff swollen joints, no.
I can see the class action suits coming against Pfizer.
