Very slowly, over many years, I've developed debilitating muscle pains, horrible fatigue, tingling in my arms, legs and fingers; I've gone to the doctor for 5 years, at least, trying to find out what is wrong with me.
I JUST turned 40 years old and should not feel like this.
Out of nowhere, I heard about CoQ10 depletion and just started the supplement today.
I was never told ANY of these symptoms could relate to the Lipitor - in fact, I specifically asked if any of my medications could be causing these problems.
