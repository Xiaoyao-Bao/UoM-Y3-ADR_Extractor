After being on 10 mg of Lipitor for about 3 years, I started to experience speech and swallowing problems which got worse while I continued to take it as recommended by my physician.
After 6 months, my speech and swallowing were so bad that I stopped the Lipitor.
It is now one year after stopping and I was diagnosed with ALS (which tests later verified was incorrect) and I think that I am beginning to improve in speech and swallowing.
but very slowly and I may never get back to where I was before Lipitor.
It has also affected my memory.
Had Pfizer just mentioned in their precautions that Lipitor just might cause speech and swallowing problems, I would have stopped taking statin drugs 6 months earlier and I would have been OK again.
