Lipitor did help lower my cholestrol, but has caused other health problems not listed in the side effects.
I have had digestion problems since I have started taking this, my pancreas is very swollen.
I have been through every test possible, and they cannot find anything wrong with me.
I have lost 35 lbs, and have recently just heard that this has happened to other lipitor patients.
I stopped taking it, and feel better already!.
Please email me if you have had similiar problems.
