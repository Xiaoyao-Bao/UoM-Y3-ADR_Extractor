Sleeping all day and night - exhaustion.
10mg started two weeks ago - have slept soundly 30 of the last 48 hours.
But even when awake, feel exhausted.
Can't continue this way.
Will ask physician for alternative at next visit.
Normally have high energy and sleep average of 6 to 7 hrs per day.
Haven't been back yet for blood work to establish reduction numbers.
