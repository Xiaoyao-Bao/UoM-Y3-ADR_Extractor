I Have been on lipitor for several years.
I have noticed over the last few years that I have not been feeling well.
The last couple of months I have been suffering with vertigo.
I have had all kinds of test and they all come up negative.
I decided to go off lipitor about three days ago to see if this is causing it.
I have a freind with the same problem and is on lipitor for about the same amount of time as I have been on it.
I'm hoping that this dizziness will go away in time now that I have stopped lipitor.
None of my doctors will admit that is lipitor causing the problem.
