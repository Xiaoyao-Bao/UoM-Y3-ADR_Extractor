The side effects came slowly and it took me a while to make the connection.
I slowly started experiencing pain in one shoulder joint then the other.
Then deep muscle pain in the muscle of one arm then the other.
Finally after the muscles in my chest started aching and insomnia had set in.
I called my doctor who took me off the 10 mg. dosage.
Looking back I realize now that I had symptoms early on but chose to overlook them.
Bad choice on my part.
I hope now that the 9 months of taking these meds hasn't caused permanent damage !!.
After reading more about the medication I can only say that for me.
I am done with taking statins.
I will control my cholesterol by losing weight,exercise and diet.
It did lower my total cholesterol and my LDL's but the effect it had on my overall well being was too devastating.
