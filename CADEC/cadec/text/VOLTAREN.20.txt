I did not experience any, but only took 1 tab once a day for two days.
I found that Voltaren took away all my pain, i rarely use pain relief because i find it never helps or takes too long to take affect and just "soldier on".
As i am only young and relatively healthy i did not experience any side effects.
HOWEVER my parents both have had bad side effects.
so i dont recommend it if you suffer from High blood pressure, IBS, are prone to stomache ulcers, prone to reflux, heart burn or are an asthmatic.
Otherwise if like me you are healthy and just need pain relief when nothing else will cut it just take one a day, and dont stay on them.
the chances of getting side effects seem to increase according to the length of time you continue using them (like most drugs) and the effectiveness of the pain relief can also wear off over time.
