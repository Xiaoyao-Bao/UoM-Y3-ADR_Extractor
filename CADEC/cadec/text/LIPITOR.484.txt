Taking 10 mg. of Lipitor.
Was getting some muscle aches.
A few weeks ago, got severe intense left arm and shoulder pain.
My MD (who did not want me to take it) diagnosed a rotator cuff injury (liver test came back normal).
X-rays did not show a fracture & MRI did not show a tear.
In the past 2 weeks the toes (esp. the big toe) on my left foot have started to twitch.
This is really scaring me because my father had Parkinson's.
Also, in the last couple of days, I have started to get pain between my shoulder blades.
I have not had my cholesterol tested since I started taking it; but I am stopping it today.
It seems to work great for some people.
But everyone should be very vigilant and check out any changes immediately.
It is too easy to attribute a change to a pulled muscle or aging, etc Thanks for this website.
