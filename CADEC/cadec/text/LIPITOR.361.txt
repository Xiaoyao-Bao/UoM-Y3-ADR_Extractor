Aching over my entire body, extreme fatigue, stiffness when getting up in the morning or getting up after being off my feet for awhile.
Doctors make me feel like I am crazy.
Also had severe depression.
Have taken 2-3 different statins.
Like others who have written in, I have felt as though I am 100 yrs. old.
There is a wonderful website Spacedoc.net with much information on the statins, and he has published a book as well on the serious side effects of the statins.
