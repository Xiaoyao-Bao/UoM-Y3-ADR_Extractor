no side effects whatsoever.
after 12 days on voltaren (75mg twice daily) i am still bruising and having inflammation especially around my elbow where the ulner nerve is compressed.
haven't noticed any difference/relief from this drug.
i don't have anything bad to say about this drug.
it just didn't work for me.
