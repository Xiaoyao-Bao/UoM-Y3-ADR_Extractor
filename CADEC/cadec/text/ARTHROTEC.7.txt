started having a severe sudden onset headache in the back of head, resulted in trip to DR, BP was extrememly high, and pulse was high as well, after three shots, and 3 clonidine to bring down bp was recommend to visit ER.
Had high BP for another 10 days, before it came back down to normal, and pulse is still extremely high 3 weeks after stopping the medicine.
I only took for 7 days, and it caused this much problems.
Never again, I would not recommend this to use.
I have had 2 trips back to dr, since this happened and a third visit due to the tachycardia is schedule in 3 more days.
I will not use anymore.
