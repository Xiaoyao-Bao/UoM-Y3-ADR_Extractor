On Lipitor immediately after heart attack.
Did not realize how stunned I was mentally and physically, till I stopped taking it because of extreme muscle weakness.
Mental clarity, reading comprehension, short term memory improved quickly and chest and heart feels normal again.
Have been off Lipitor for 3 weeks and have not needed Nitro since.
Still have soreness and weakness in thighs from walking short distances and am still not as sharp mentally as I was previously.
Suspect slip in vision related to Lipitor since vision is slowing improving.
The worst thing about this insidious drug was that I did not realize how badly it was effecting me!
Thought that this was how bad you felt after a heart attack and that I was tolerating the medication well.
