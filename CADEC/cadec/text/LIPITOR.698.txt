I took Lipitor for 8 weeks and experienced extreme pain in all my joints.
It has brought me to tears and I have had to use sick leave from work.
My doctor tested me for arthritis and other problems and all tests came back normal but thank goodness she took me off the Lipitor.
I would not recommend this medication.
