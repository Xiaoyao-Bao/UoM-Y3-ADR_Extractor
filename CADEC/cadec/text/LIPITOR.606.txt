I have been taking Lipitor for two years and have experience leg pain, soreness in muscles and tiredness.
I am otherwise a healthy person.
Recently, the pain in my my left leg is so bad that I can't sleep on that side at night.
My doctor suggested going off lipitor as of today to see if that is the culprit.
I will post another message when I stay off of it for awhile.
I really do believe that it is the Lipitor though, as I had never had problems prior to being put on that particular medicine.
