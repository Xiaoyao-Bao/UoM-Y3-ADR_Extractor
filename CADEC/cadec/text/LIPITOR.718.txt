For about 15 months I experienced SEVERE fatigue, and initially for about three months very bad headaches which diminished in intensity but never completely went away.
Insomnia, I would wake up at 3:00 am and be unable to go back to sleep.
Difficulty in swallowing and constipation.
I went to 3 different doctors for these symptoms.
All of them dismissed my view that maybe the Lipitor was causing all of this even though the symptoms started about 3 weeks after uping the dosage from 20 mg. to 40.
I quit taking Lipitor about a week ago - thanks in part to this web site.
Within 3 days I was no longer consistently waking up at 3:00 am unable to go back to sleep.
Headaches seem to be dissipating as well, and the extreme fatigue is disappearing.
I don't expect MD's to be knowledgeable about every drug and I recognize that this drug has probably saved a lot of lives, but it is the attitude that I find irresponsible, that these problems couldn't possibly be caused by Lipitor since as all the doctors said.
