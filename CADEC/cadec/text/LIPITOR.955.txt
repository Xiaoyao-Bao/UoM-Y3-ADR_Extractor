I took this drug for 2 years before onset of joint pain (knees)and painfull welts on bottom of feet (had to use cane to walk).
Initially, my quack MD put me on anti-inflam. drugs.
Subsequently, I quit the drug and the MD.
All symptoms subsided completely.
However, I had a milder reaction to Zocor; dizziness with Pravachol; now on Zetia (mild joint pain).
I believe that Lipitor left me with permanent joint damage and would join any class-action lawsuit relating to this crumby drug Lipitor.
