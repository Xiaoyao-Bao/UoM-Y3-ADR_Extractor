I did not link my problems to the Lipitor until my husband had major problems, now I know what has caused 10 years of Neuropathy, I have Burning feet always in bed at night, I do not have Diabetes (which would cause this) and was tested in DC at WRAMC and they found no reason that I should have this and gave me a tube of Capsacian!!!
I still live with this.
Four years ago I developed Frozen Shoulder in my left arm, unbelievable pain, within weeks the other shoulder became as painful as the first, could not raise my arms at all, tested at Bethesda Naval Hosp., no reason found, I was told it would last about 2 years unless I took therapy sessions, I took the sessions and begged for someone to put me out of my misery each time, it eventually passed in about a year but I still have shoulder pain.
Today I am stopping the Lipitor, maybe I have read too much on the subject but the one that really scares me is the Memory Loss, All the drug com.
tests were done to see how well the Statins did for Cholesterol and the heart benefits, but no testing (or none that the consumer was told of) was ever done to see how it effects the brain function.
Memory is too precious a thing to lose to a drug!.
