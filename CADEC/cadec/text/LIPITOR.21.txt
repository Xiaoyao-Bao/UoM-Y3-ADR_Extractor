The lipitor works for lowering cholestrol levels.
However, I wonder if there is a corolation between lipitor (statins) and restless legs syndrome (rls).
I've talked with a couple others that have rls and they are on lipitor too.
Does anyone taking lipitor experience rls?
I'll check back here for the results.
