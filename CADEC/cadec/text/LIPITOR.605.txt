Malaise, exhaustion, severe muscle pain, severe depression and anxiety.
I would go to the gym and be so exhausted from changing clothes and walking upstairs that I could not actually exercise.
My doctor told me I was making it up because I did not want to take medication.
It took finding a web site to discover it was the Lipitor.
I was so depressed I having thoughts about suicide.
Yeah, that will improve your quality of life!.
