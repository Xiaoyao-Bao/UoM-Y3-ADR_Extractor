Took for 5 years and thought foot pain was from bunion and hammer toe until I started to review side effects.
Severe neuropathy, sensation of cold toes when they were indeed warm and at times I had severe burning of the feet, leg cramps,.
It may have done an excellent job of reducing cholesterol, but it is important to have quality of life and I did not have that anymore.
I WOULD NEVER TAKE LIPITOR (or any statin) AGAIN!!!!!.
