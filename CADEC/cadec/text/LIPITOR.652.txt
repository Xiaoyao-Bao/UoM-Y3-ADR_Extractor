Will not continue taking Lipitor!.
After taking for only 3 days I experienced general overal weakness.
fatigue.
nausea.
diziness.
trembling.
trouble concentrating.
sadness.
moodiness.
insomia.
neck pain.
dull headaches.
feverish.
clamy feeling.
tingly feeling in hands and scalp.
basically felt rotton all day long.
Would wake up feeling good, but about an hour or so after taking Lipitor all the above symptoms returned.
Others swear by this drug, but they can have it.
Doctor took me off of it, but I would have done so myself anyway.
Felt like I was being poisened quite honestly!
Thank GOD I found this website, as all I could find on the web was how WONDERFUL Lipitor is!
Maybe for some, but not for all of us obviously.
