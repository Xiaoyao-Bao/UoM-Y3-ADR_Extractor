Has been all OK until recently when I started to get " fluey" feelings in upper arms, legs etc
As I had just recently had flu jab thought this was the cause.
However the symptoms persisted, GP said " just flu jab" - but after 4 weeks!
Noticed today after leaving Artrotec off for a day or so ,that things were much better until I took one dose.
fluey feelings returned within a hour.
Draw your own conclusions.
