After taking Lipitor for several months, and gradually incrasing my dose to 40mg, I started to get EXTREMELY fatigued.
I had to take a nap every day for 2 - 3 hours.
After discontinuing the medicine, my energy levels bounced back to normal.
It really helped lower my cholesterol, but have to wonder what it was doing to me to make me so tired.
