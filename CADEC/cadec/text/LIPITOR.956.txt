When I began taking Lipitor I had what the doctors referred to as TIA's.
Loss of balance, loss of speech and after several months I began having seizure type symptoms.
I have been seeing a Neurologist since I was told I was having TIA's.
I have gone through a TEE and a brain catheter and everything came back normal.
The Neurologist told me to stop taking Liptor one week ago and I am starting to feel a little better.
I am still feeling extremely tired.
I am hoping this all passes.
