Was on Provachol.
Dr switched me to Lipitor since he said it was more effective.
After 78 days on Lipitor, I had constant low level pain in my butt and upper thighs.
Strong pain would come and go randomly.
There would be spikes of pain so severe that I felt like I would collapse.
Would have to stop standing/walking and sit down for 5 or 10 minutes.
After I stopped taking Lipitor, the pain gradually subsided over a 9 month period.
I was pain free for a few months, but the same pain has returned and has been with me for the past 5 months.
I now wonder if this is a chronic pain condition.
