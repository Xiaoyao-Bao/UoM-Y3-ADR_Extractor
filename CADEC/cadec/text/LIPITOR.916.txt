First - WOW!
Second - okay I just started taking Lipitor yesterday - one dose in.
20mg dose and will try for two months, if something happens sooner I'll stop before the two months are up.
What I am reading is that most doctors are NOT prescribing conservative dosages - maybe take that back to them the next appointment?
Eh?
My first night - the soundest sleep in over four years!
without pain killers for the constant trigeminal neuralgis (a side benefit to be sure).
Not happy about the idea of statins - strange psychic events when my mother was taking them (Zocor) - too strange to repeat in a public forum.
So I am here looking for information about the side effects - anecdotally presented - as the web site for Lipitor does not have the information that would typically come on the drug sheet .
If anyone knows of a site that has the real skinny on Lipitor's effects - please pass it along.
Much appreciated!.
