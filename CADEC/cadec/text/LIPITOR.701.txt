severe muscle pain in left arm and neck and elbow,and prickling,numbness in hand.
strange poisen-ivy like rash on chest and breast that would not go away UNTIL I stopped taking lipitor.
I put up with this for 2 years until I realized the medication could have caused it and stopped - things cleared up IMMEDIATELY.
would prefer to try Niacin - will NEVER take Lipitor again.
