I have been taking this medication for more than 4 years for cholesterol.
It has reduced the numbers, BUT I now have totally changed my way of life with general weakness, constant leg pain, and specifically terrible pain in my feet and ankles.
The bottoms of my feet hurt to the point of where I can no longer walk comfortably, and have experienced loss of balance several times a day.
It is making me feel like 75 instead of 50 and I researched the web and came to this site.
I have been telling my MD about symptoms for months.
Blood tests keep coming back normal.
Doc says must be circulation.
I feel like I'm wearing someone else's feet sometimes!
Tingling toes to numb toes and sore ankles and legs.
I finally get his attention and he tells me he's changing prescriptions to Mevacore (hello. it's the same thing).
After research I am quitting the medication and will give it a month to see what happens.
Anyone put me onto some good information about withdrawals?
Been reading some things I really don't like.
