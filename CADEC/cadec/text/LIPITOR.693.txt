Extreme lower back pain, pain in neck and shoulders, calf cramping, red bumps on my skin.
Muscle fatigue.
I only took this drug for 4 months.
I have inherited my high cholesterol.
My career involves great physical activity.
I thought I had just overexerted myself and was over stressed.
I had no idea a medication could cause so much economic and physical damage.
I am still in the process of recovering from both.
