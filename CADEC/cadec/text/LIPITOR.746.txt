After being on Lipitor for only two months, I was experiencing debilitating muscle pain in my arms, legs and back.
Additionally, I was experiencing severe cramping in my legs and back.
The good news was that my cholesterol dropped from 269 to 160.
The bad news was that long term, it would likely impact the heart muscle.
Once the doctor saw the CPK levels on my next liver function test, he called (himself) and said to stop taking Lipitor immediately.
Interestingly, Niaspan had the same effect.
I'm currently trying a therapy of 6000 mg. of vitamin C daily.
An interesting site for information on this is www.newmediaexplorer.org/sepp/2003/11/09/ vitamin_c_beats_statins_in_cholesterol_heart_disease.htm and http://www.cqs.com/lipitor.htm.
I'll post again after I have my next cholesterol test (2/7) and see what the vitamin C has done.
I'm not certain that any of the statins are worth the risk.
