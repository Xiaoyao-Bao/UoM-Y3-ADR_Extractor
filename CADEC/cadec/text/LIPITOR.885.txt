extreme constant pain, legs, hips, fuzzy headed, muscle loss, possible permanent damage.
I am totally convinced this stuff is dangerous, it does lower cholesterol, but to what end?
Found more natural fix which is more effective, excellent results, better quality of life, and better health overall.
Blood test was 8.06 total, now 3.05 without using Lipitor!
Had around 25 angina attacks per week, now 0.
Was totally disabled, now active.
