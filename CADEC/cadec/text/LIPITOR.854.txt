2 years with no problems, then toe neuropathy for two years now and other foot problems because of this I assume.
I stopped Lipitor after taking it for 2 years and toe neuropathy started.
I also had stomach problems and pain.
After stopping Lipitor, I thought my heart would jump out of my chest, but now stomach and heart are both OK - Feet are terrible thanks to Lipitor.
I know many others that have had problems with Lipitor - feet and legs - and had to stop.
All my blood test were normal.
I weigh 114 and 5'2 .
Hike, play golf and keep busy.
It is a terrible drug and should be off the market.
