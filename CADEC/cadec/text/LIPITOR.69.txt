Eye sight appeared foggy when it was perfect before, some loss of hair, aches and pains in my back, a cough, sore ankles when I exercise.
Sore joints.
but even more scarey it made me depressed!
What sort of drugs are they maiking us take?
I'm stopping right now after finding this site.
It did lower my CL though.
I'm going to take Omega 3, carry on exercising and try my luck.
