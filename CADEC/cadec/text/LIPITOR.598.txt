extreme fatigue, short term memory loss, muscle weakness, hip pain, some cramping in toes.
Have been taking 10 mg of lipitor for 8 months.
Also on strict low cholesterol diet and taking magnesium, omega 3, olive oil.
Lowered LDL from 186 to 80 and total cholesterol from 260 to 130.
have also lost 40 lbs.
Heart doctor says I should continue taking lipitor because it is good for the arterial walls and heart.
However, because of increasing bad side effects (especially extreme tiredness and general feeling of malais) am going to discontinue use and maintain strict diet and exercise.
Benefits of Lipitor on cholesterol levels have been very good but am increasingly concerned about long term side effects.
