I've really had no side affects what so ever.
I have blood work done regualarly to check my cholesterol levels.
I've had high cholesterol since I was 19, now I'm 38 and have been on this medication since 1997.
My cholesterol is still high but not as high.
In Canada the rating should be below 5.20, with being on this medication its still about 6.24 were in 1997 my level was 8.45.
Its come down quite a bit, but I do exercise and watch what I eat as well.
