I took this drug a few years ago and went off it because my hair started thinning.
This time around I am feeling very depressed, tired and nervous.
I'm not sure if it is the drug, but I'm going to go off it to see.
Oh, yes, the drug worked wonders on my cholesterol.
Plummeted about 90 points in a month.
