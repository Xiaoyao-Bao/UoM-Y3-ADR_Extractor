After 2 months being on Lipitor I experienced extreme pain and loss of muscle in left leg.
Advice from Cardiologist was to immediately stop taking Liptitor.
It was too late, resulting in the loss of being able to work and ended up disabitlity and would like to join a class action lawsuit against the drug company responsible.
Would like to hear from others who have had problems with this drug.
