developed parkinson's disease.
discovered thru 23andme DNA profiling I possess a mutation in a gene, SLCO1B1, that codes a transport protein responsible for moving statins into the liver to be detoxified.
Studies have noted patients with greatly incrased plasma statin levels (>134% and AUCs more than 400% ABOVE NORMAL) toxic levels indeed.
The neurological damage I have suffered due to toxic levels of lipitor seems to be permanent.
Nothing I have tried has reversed the extreme symptoms.
in the beginning megadoses of coenzyme Q10 did help; that was 6 yrs ago.
the deterioration continues.
the slco1b1 mutation IS NOT rare, occurring in 26-34% of caucasian poulation, less in african am, and more in Asian pop.
seems many individuals with the mutation(s) develop severe myalgias and myopathies, prompting discontinuance of the statin.
for those of us who did not suffer the muscle dmaage, neurodegeneration is what occurs in my opinion.
Am aware of 7 other indicviduals who feel they are sufferring same effects as I from a fat soluble statin.
