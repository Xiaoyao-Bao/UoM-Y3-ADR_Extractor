I have not been takeing Lipitor very long it has only been a few weeks and my Dr has me taking it twice a week but since I have been taking it my right hand has been getting numb and hurting it feels like there is no circulation getting to it and after reading all of this it is probally the lipitor, I am very worried now after reading all of this and feel I should quit taking it.
