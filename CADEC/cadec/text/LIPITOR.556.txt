I didn't think I had any side effects until I started reading through some of the list of problems other people are having.
I thought it was just the over 40 factor.
But, I too have joint pain in my knees, hips, lower back, and shoulders.
I have been having pain in my left thigh.
As far as forgetting things, I am occasionally saying to my fellow worker.
It has done a good job of lowering my cholestoral but, are the side effects worth it?.
