Joint pain, SEVERE muscle pain - especially in lower calfs of both legs.
Some mornings I had a hard time walking.
Didn't lower cholesterol much.
Be Very Very Careful using this drug and other statins.
This bad stuff sneaks up on you and - BAM - you could be in BIG trouble!
Was on this and then Zocor for a total of 3 months.
When I thought I was having a heart attack they admitted me to emergency room and overnight stay.
No real heart problems - but weak heart muscle - likely cause of Lipitor.
Lower legs have been hurting for over one year since I stopped taking meds.
Doctors just conducted biopsy of leg muscle because it is inflamed and waiting for results.
Likely not good.
Also much fatigue then - and now.
DO NOT TAKE STATINS - and if you do I hear the CQ10 is a good protector for some of the muscle damage that the statins can cause.
Too late for me, I think, as the damage is done and permanent.
