My Prostate Oncologist prescribed 10 mg per day for high LDL.
The first day I did my normal excercise routine, ran two miles, lifted weights, etc
That night I had neck pain, and thought it was nothing.
Took the second tablet the next day.
Upon arising on the second day, I noticed that I was very tired.
Pain or cramping in both quads (above knee, back of leg).
I was not motivated to do anything.
Spent most of the day in bed, reading a book, something I rarely do.
By the afternoon I could barely function.
Felt generally terrible, flu like symptoms, lower back ache, irritable, no motivation, and pain in knuckles, neck, and both upper legs.
I had a worse headache than usual (I have migraine), but who knows?
Went to the internet and found this site.
Saw Lipitor commercial on TV warning about muscle pain.
I did not take the tablet today, and I am feeling better.
I attribute the condition to the Lipitor, although there is no proof.
I am a prostate cancer patient and take a number of other drugs, which raise the LDL.
Apparently, some (a few) patients cannot tolerate this drug.
I note that there are some on this list who have permanent damage, so it is serious for some of us.
My legs are still sore, and feel worse than they did after a day of agressive downhill skiing a week ago.
Apparently this works for most, but some people have a severe and not so obvious reaction.
Stop immediately if there is any muscle pain.
