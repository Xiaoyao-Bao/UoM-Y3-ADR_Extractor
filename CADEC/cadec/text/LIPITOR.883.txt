within 2 hours started having heart attack symptoms.
Had to go to ER.
I was in ER within 3 hours of taking 1st pill.
It was scary trying to make sure I had proper observation and not over-reaction because of the symptoms.
I had to slow people down several times.
Now convinced it would have had serious health risks for me had I even tried taking a second pill the next day or even continuing taking them.
It took a while (months) before I started to feel normal again.
