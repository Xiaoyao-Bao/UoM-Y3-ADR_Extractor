I was prescribed Voltaren-XR 100 MG for lower back pain.
It worked wonders for my pain - I thought that I had discovered a wonder drug - then after 30 days I was at work and started passing massive amounts of blood without pain or warning.
I thought I was bleeding to death!
I went to the ER and was admitted and had a colonoscopy the next day.
The Dr discover an ulcer in by lower bowel which he believes was caused by the Voltaren.
The bleeding has now stopped and I am OK, but I will never take this drug or any drug in it's class again.
Hindsight is 20-20.
