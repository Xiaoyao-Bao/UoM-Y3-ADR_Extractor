For as long as I could remember I've always had perfect cholesterol (from a percentage perspective anyway).
It's always been right around 120/120.
For what ever reason my LDL shot up to 175 so a (not my normal one) Dr just prescribed me Lipitor.
I didn't notice any problems for just over 2 months then all of a sudden one day I stared feeling horrible like a severe flu just hit me.
For the next few days I couldn't get enough sleep I was incredibly week and had pains throughout my upper body.
I saw my regular Dr and decided to stop taking the drug, she also drew blood.
Luckily most of the tests came back normal but there was a small spike in something with my liver which was normal before.
My Cholesterol was LDL 95 HDL 109 (which I thought it is advertised to raise?) and my triglycerides were great as well.
I can't say that the drug doesn't work but compared to how I feel it's not with it and I'll never take it again.
I've been off it for 3 days now and only feel slightly bett.
