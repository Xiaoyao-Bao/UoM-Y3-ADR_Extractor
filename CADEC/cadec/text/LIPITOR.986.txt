muscle aches in legs.
I tried 10mg a day for 6 days but developed muscle pain in legs.
Doctor is now putting me on 10mg once a week to see if I can tolerate that dosage.
Thanks to all you guys for a heads-up on what can happen with this drug as it is nice not to be blindsided by the medical community.
Thanks again to everybody who posts here!!.
