First of all, I noticed severe lower back pain.
I put this off as a work-out related pain.
After the pain intensified after it should have gone away, I became concerned.
Then I noticed that my knee and my right hip hurt.
Then I started crying for no reason.
I yelled at my poor dog for doing nothing.
ALl in all, this drug really sucks.
I hate it.
I hate the doctor that put me on it.
I can't wait to get off of it.
I shouldn't have been on it in the first place.
I swear she must be doing it for the drug compant kick backs.
