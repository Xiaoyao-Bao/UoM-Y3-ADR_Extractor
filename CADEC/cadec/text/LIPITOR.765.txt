Male, 67, while taking Lipitor for 5 months I experienced severe weight loss, muscle pain and loss of strength.
AFTER coming off Lipitor, arthritis set in over entire body, which I have never suffered with before taking Lipitor.
.
Has anybody else experienced any arthritis AFTER coming off Lipitor?.
