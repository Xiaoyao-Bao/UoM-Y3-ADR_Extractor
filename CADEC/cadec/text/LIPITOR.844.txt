after taking the drug for several years, I developed one of the supposedly rare side effects .
muscle disintegration/degeneration .
fortuntately when I experienced fatigue and muscle/joint pain, I remembered some of the warnings I had read when I first started taking the drug .
My doctor ordered a blood test when I told him of my symptoms and concerns and it revealed a grossly excessive amount of muscle tissue in my blood .
I haven't taken it since .
after I stopped taking Lipitor, I felt normal about three weeks later .
