Extremely heavy menstral cycles, fatigue, slow healing & clotting.
If I miss a day, headaches begin to creep in.
Tried many others, this seemed to work best for quite some time.
No day is pain free, though.
Not bad on stomach - always take w/ milk or food.
This is genetic for me, so NSAIDs will be in my life for a while.
but fear long-term use of this one.
