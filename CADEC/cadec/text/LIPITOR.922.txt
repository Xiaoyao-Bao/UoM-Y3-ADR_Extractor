been taking Lipitor for 15 years ,have experienced all manner of side effects from irregullar heartbeat ,sever fatigue and now have a fatty liver !!!!
yet doctors insist i still take it ,40mg daily .
I also has type 1 Diabetes for 35 years.
Lipitor does its job but at what cost latter down the line !!!!!.
