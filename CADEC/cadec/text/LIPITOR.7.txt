I am a physician.
I have been on simvastatin, pravastatin, and now atorvastatin.
My joint pains are severe and I have developed a dys-motility, irritable bowel syndrome of the sigmoid area and descending colon with obstipation and constipation that is very bothersome.
Cannot take statins and I agree with most other comments of patients on fatigue and joint pain and short term memory dysfunction.
