Had 1 pill only 10mg lipitor(had tried lipex(2pills)1st but face had swollen up-cleared 2weeks) anyway the next morning -after sitting down for 10minutes- i stood up to walk and it was a very painful and a very slow stooped debilatating (compressed back)type of walk but after 5-10 minutes of standing could straighten back-only problem when sitting down -lower back.
no other part of back a problem-can play tennis with only slight pain if bending over.
it is now 14 days and still same problem -tend to stand or lie down for computor work no other side affects that im aware of .
Will see doctor if it continues to be a problem in 1 week though i see some have continued to have problems even after stopping and after reading this blog i am swayed to think that it is a degenative muscle problem( which will heal in time due to 1 pill only usage) and may not be other internal organ reactions as i 1st suspected.
