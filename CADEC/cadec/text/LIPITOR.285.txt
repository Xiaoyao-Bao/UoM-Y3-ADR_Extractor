I've not started the drug, but it was perscribed to me by my Dr for having low HDL (good).
I've talked to a lot of people and researched this drug and I've found nothing GOOD about it.
I am going to try alternative (herbal) medications to rise my good HDL levles.
Afraid of side effects and I don't want to jepordize my health by adding a drug to my system that can harm me!.
