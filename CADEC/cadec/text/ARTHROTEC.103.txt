It seems as if bleeding forever is a side effect but doctors tell you that its not the drug
I have been on Arthotec for Three months I still have pain and stiffness
at first week into this drug I was in so much pain I sat on the floor at work and thought I was gaving a baby.
I always feel weak and almost fainted a bunch of times.
Consider somthing that works I am switching today as this isnt in my head.
