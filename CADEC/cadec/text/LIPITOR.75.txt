A few weeks after taking lipitor my ankles and the soles of my feet feels like I was walking on hot coals I blamed my new shoes i bought.
So I bought a new pair from the chemist they didn't stop the pain either.
I was at a local club about 2 months later walked into the toilet I'd been in there many times before but this I couldn't work out witch door to walk out(I think it also has an effect on your memory).
Also I suffer badly from muscle pain from my neck & shoulders to my lower back.
My wife also took lipitor but has since stopped but it effected her a lot worse than me.
She has since stopped taking any medication it's been 6 months and still recovering from the effects.
I am now taking Ezetrol a lot better.
I still get pains in my back but not as bad.
I just wish the doctors would tell you about the side affects to expect.
