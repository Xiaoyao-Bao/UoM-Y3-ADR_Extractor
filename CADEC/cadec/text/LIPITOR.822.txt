EXCRUCIATING PAIN IN SHOULDERS AND NECK, MEMORY LOSS, FELT JUST STRANGE.
STARTED TAKING LIPITOR 20 MG 4 YEARS AGO, DR UPPED IT TO 40 MG 5 MONTHS AGO.
TOOK ME ALL THIS TIME AND THIS RATING BOARD TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS REALLY WRONG WITH ME.
DR KEPT TELLING ME I WAS DEPRESSED.
WHO WOULDN'T BE WITH THIS HIDEOUS CONSTANT PAIN?
TOOK MYSELF OFF OF THE LIPITOR 7 DAYS AGO AND FEELING MUCH BETTER.
WHEN I WENT TO DR WITH THIS HE SAID.
