I experienced permanent nerve damage to my feet & severe leg cramping.
Symptoms started as a warming sensation on my lower legs after a few months and progressed to the permanent nerve damage.
I discontinued taking Lipitor over 5 years ago.
My feet are now simultaneously numb and painful.
DO NOT TAKE THIS DANGEROUS DRUG.
BE VERY AWARE OF THE PERMANENT NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES.
