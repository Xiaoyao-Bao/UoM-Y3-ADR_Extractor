Severe leg muscle pain and leg cramping which started gradually and within four weeks interfered with my ability to drive because of calf muscle cramping.
I have been informed by my doctor that my LDL was much improved over the short period while I was on the drug.
However, this drug has caused a major change in my life style.
Although I stopped this drug three months ago and I was assured the leg pain would resolve, I have been unable to function because of the continuous leg pain and discomfort.
I was on 10mg a day and was informed that this was a low dose.
The result of taking this drug has seriously impaired my ability to take long walks or exercise in general since to do so causes the leg muscle pain to flair up.
Although I have been assured that this will resolve, I have been off the drug for 3 months and have only experienced a modicum of improvement.
