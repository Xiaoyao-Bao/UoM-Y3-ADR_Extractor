I am menstruating with heavy bleeding every 11 days.
Honestly, I can't figure out how I can lose this much blood and still function.
I have horrific cramps to begin with, so I can't say whether arthrotec increased that.
I have endometriosis, so I'm not sure if that is something that doesn't agree with arthrotec.
It did help with the pain I experience with the pinched nerve, but it is not worth it to me to continue.
