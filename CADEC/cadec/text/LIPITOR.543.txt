weakness, tired all the time, leg, arm and back pain, not concentrating well, flu symptons randomly every few weeks, bad dreams a lot, purple sploches around waist.
I know that it works but I would rather feel like my old self as I have always been active and love exercising but on this medication I have to make myself get out and walk and go to my gym classes.
