I took Lipitor for one month.
I was having severe pain in my legs.
After I quit taking it, I still have muscle weakness in my legs and pain when I sit down or stand from a sitting position.
My doctor doesn't seem to know what to do about it.
I am scheduled to see another doctor next month.
I was taking 20 mg of Lipitor.
Everyone I talk to who is taking Lipitor says they have leg pain.
I will not ever take another Lipitor tablet.
