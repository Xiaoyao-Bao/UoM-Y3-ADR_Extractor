In decreasing order of severity: Extreme vertigo, short term memory loss, tendonitisis in heels, calf leg cramps, muscle loss, severe tintitinitis (ringing in ears).
On Lipitor for 4 months.
Switched to Vitorin for six months with decreased side effects, Chlosterol dropped from 220 to 90 but now side effects are worsening, particularly heel tendon bruising and muscle loss.
See http://www.spacedoc.net/rest_of_my_story.html for articles on side effects.
Be aware and monitor side effects.
Red Yeast is a statin.
My allopathic docs are both taking most folks off statins and recommending slo-naicin and coenzyme Q10 with blood tests every three to six months to see if colesterol remains down.
