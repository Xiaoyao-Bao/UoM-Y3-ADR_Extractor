day two of taking the product, and I have pain and tingling in my fingers as well as a major sharp pain in the side, which could be of of many things including simply gas - a common problem as reported here.
Way too early to post something more constructive, but I will come back later.
Thanks to all posters here - big relief from your reports to know this is not unusual.
