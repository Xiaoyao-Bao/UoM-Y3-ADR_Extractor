If I take the pill on an empty stomach I get a very faint sensation of queasiness .
almost to faint to notice.
However, I also get diarrhoea at least twice a day.
There are no gas pains and no other symptoms, so it's inconvenient more than anything else.
When I am on holiday at the coast I am pain free, mostly, so don't take any Arthrotec, but when I get back to a drier climate the pain is severe, so Arthrotec is very important to me and my quality of life.
It also allows me to sleep.
