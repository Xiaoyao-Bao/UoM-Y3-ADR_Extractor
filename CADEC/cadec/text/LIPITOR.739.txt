Chronic pain in all my joints and muscles.
Really bad in my thighs.
I had been on Pravachol for aboout 3 years and switched to Lipitor because it's supposed to lower triglycerides too.
I had the joint and muscle pain already and was told it was arthritis or neuropathy (I'm also a diabetic).
My thighs were never this sore before I started the Lipitor, though.
Both of my parents died at from heart disease at a relatively young age (dad-57, mom-66), but if this is what is causing this pain I think I would rather die prematurely than live like this.
I am 41 and feel like I'm 81.
I came across this site while searching for Lipitor side effects.
I was also going to do a search on MS or fibromyalgia, but maybe I should just quit taking this medicine and take my chances.
