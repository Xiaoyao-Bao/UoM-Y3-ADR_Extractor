For the first week I took one pill at bedtime, but then switched to mornings with breakfast.
I experienced extreme uterine cramping within 30 minutes of taking in the morning; I was in excruciating pain for an hour so I called an ambulance and was rushed to the emergency room.
Heavy bleeding started within 30 minutes after the cramping ceased.
Medical personnel dismissed the symptoms as not being related to taking this drug, but once I stopped taking, my cramping and bleeding stopped.
Subsequent uterine & vaginal ultrasounds did not show anything else to be the cause.
My OB/Gyn told me that she uses misoprostal (1 of the drugs in Arthrotec) for miscarriages & advised me to stop taking the drug.
I would not recommend to females.
If you do take this drug, please pay careful attention to your body and other symptoms that may appear.
Read all drug material carefully.
