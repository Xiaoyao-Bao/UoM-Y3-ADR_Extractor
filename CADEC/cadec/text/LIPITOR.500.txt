Leg cramps and pain.
Contracted Peripheral Neuropathy.
Have lost most of my feeling in feet, legs and hands.
Tingeling in fingers and feet is painful.
Difficult to walk and keep balance.
Difficult to sleep due to burning and pain.
Took 20 mg for about a year.
Doctor moved dosage to 40 mg.
Very slowly over four months I began having leg cramps, noticed I was having difficulty picking my feet up, itching (tingling) around toes of right foot.
Doctor suspected Neuropathy when Athlete's foot couldn't be detected.
Neurologist said stop taking Lipitor immediately.
The damage was done as it spread to my hands and up my legs.
Have been off Lipitor eight months and still have problems.
From what I read I fear this will be with me.
This is dangerous as doctors are handing this out like candy and are not monitoring their patients closely.
The dark side of Statins far overshadow the benefits.
