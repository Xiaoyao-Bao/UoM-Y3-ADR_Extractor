Taken for excruciating disc related shooting pains through my hips and down both legs.
Was fine for the first 2 days, didn't feel much change in the pain but started feeling nauseous all the time which makes it hard to take because I need to take them with food.
Havent had any for 2 days and still feel sick all the time, I'm supposed to take them for 3 weeks but I think I'll just go back to the dr and ask for the cortisone injection.
