HORRIBLE GAS AND CONSTIPATION.
My trigycerides and cholesterol were all normal and healhty ranges, before taking Lipitor.
But because of a high C-reactive protein level, I was prescribed Lipitor.
After 3 months, My trigycerides and total cholesteral went down, even though they were fine to begin with, but my CRP level went UP!!!
From 5.96 to 13.2!!
Since treating the CRP levels was the initial purpose in prescribing me Lipitor, and since it did NOTHING to help these levels, I am therefore unsure if taking LIPITOR for high C-reactive protein levels is necessary, let alone effective.
I can't deal with this gas much longer.
