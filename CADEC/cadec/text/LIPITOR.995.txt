Aches and pains, breathing difficulties, panic attacks, stength and stamina destroyed, palpatations, strong tingling in one hand, some tinititis and occassional ear aches.
Have mentioned symptoms as they appeared to my doctor only to be prescribed zorloft for depression and anxiety and noten for heart palpatations.
This in turn has seriously upset my stomach which the doctor prescribed yet another drug for.
40 mg dose Lipitor worked well in reducing my overall cholesterol levels; which are high in my family.
The last 6 months of my life have been a health nightmare.
I was a fit, strong and very active person 5 years ago.
Now I am struggling walking too far and functioning in general.
I have only been off lipitor for 2 weeks so time will tell if lipitor is to blame for my deteriorated health; winding down on the noten and zorloft as well.
I am trying the VitC, CoQ10 and omega 3 path.
