Terrific cramps in legs and awful gas pains in abdomen and back for the last month at least.
It lowered my LDL (not enough) but also lowered my HDL as well!!
The ratio is not good!.
I started taking Lipitor about 3 yrs. ago.
I started at 20.
then my Dr doubled it to 40 and kept wanting me to double it again to 80.
After me telling him for months I would not do this.
I gave it (about 2 months ago) but decided to go to 60 rather than 80.
Well, let me tell you after taking this increased dosage for about two months I've had such gas pains around my abdomen and my back and also leg cramps.
I finally went to see a Dr in Urgent Care as the pain was so severe.
He examined me and could not find any swellings etc and asked me if I had done anything different with my meds.
I told him I had increased the Lipitor and he suggested that I stop taking it ASAP.
I only stopped taking it last night and I am anticipating that I will feel better (I like to be physical and do lots of walking).
I tried Crestor a little while ago and ended up in the Emergency Dept. of a hospital here with heart palipations.
I'm not really very confident in these STATINS!!!
I honestly feel they are dangerous and am going to try a natural product in the future.
Thank God for a Dr that finally told me to STOP!.
