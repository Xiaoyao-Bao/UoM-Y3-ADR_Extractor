extreme joint pain.
First started as a stiff neck.
That went away, then it was my knee.
The pain has since radiated to wrists and hips.
I felt general malaise and depression.
When shopping, I needed a cart for support.
This is very unlike me.
I have been on this drug for almost 3 years.
I have a very high tolerance to pain, so I hesitated to call my doctor thinking the pain would go away.
When I did call, his advice, get off the Lipitor !
I was glad to find this site to compare my side effects with others.
