I was told that what I went through was a rare experience for people on Lipitor and other statins; but I had two reactions this past year to Lipitor first and then later to the Pravachol my Dr switched me over to.
I can't remember how long I was on Lipitor (maybe 8-10 months).
I was on Pravachol for 2 months when I ended up with similar problems.
Stopped statins 4 months ago.
still having a lot of problems but there was a dramtic decrease in symptoms after stopping both the Lipitor and the Pravachol.
