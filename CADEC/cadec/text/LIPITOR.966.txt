leg pains,balance off,back pain (Lower and upper) finger pins and needles,brain vague.
stomach pain, palpitations and feeling desperately miserable.
off medication after 15 yrs of suffering.
I feel a lot better but still have leg and back pain .
I did this myself after consulting the doctor and taking him a print out of a web site with all symptoms listed.
he tore it up .
I will look for a new doctor and hope I am doing the right thing.
don't take this its poison.
