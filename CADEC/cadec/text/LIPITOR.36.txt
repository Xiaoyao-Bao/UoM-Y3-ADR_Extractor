The drug worked well to lower my cholestorol from 8.5 to <3.
Of late I have ben getting pain on the sole of my feet and find it dificult to stand or walk for too long.
Hands are also tender and tingle, Often forgetful and tired to point of lacking energy to exercise.
Lack libido.
I also feel hot and am more sensitive to sunlight.
After reading similar comments, I am off to see my doctor to change medication.
