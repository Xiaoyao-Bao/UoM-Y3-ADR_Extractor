Minor joint soreness, fatigue, have a hard time getting up in the morning.
I used to hop out of bed ready to go.
Right knee always sore and swollen.
After 8 months, I have lowered my cholesterol to a safe level using Lipitor.
I am also on Lopid to reduce Triglycerides.
I take Glucosamine and Chondroitin to reduce joint soreness.
seems to be working so far.
