NONE.
I BELIEVE THIS DRUG IS AN EXCELLENT ONE.
STARTED TAKING IT ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO WHEN GIVEN TO ME BY MY CARDIOLOGIST.
NO IMMEDIATE OR SIDE EFFECTS NOTED SINCE STARTING.
HOWEVER, ON MY LIPID BLOOD TEST FOUR MONTHS LATER, WOW WHAT AN IMPROVEMENT.
IT NOT ONLY MARKEDLY KNOCKED MY BAD CHOLESTEROL DOWN BUT I WOULD SAY IT WAS A MONUMENTAL ACHIEVEMENT.
WHEREAS TOTAL CHOLESTEROL HAD BEEN OVER 200 PREVIOUSLY, NOW IT WAS ONLY 151 AND THE BAD PORTION.
I THINK HDL.
WAS JUST 54.
I AM WELL SATISFIED.
I AM AWARE OF SOME COMPLAINTS AND SPECULATION BY OTHERS BUT I AM GOING TO KEEP TAKING IT.
