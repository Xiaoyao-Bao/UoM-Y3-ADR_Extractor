Have been on lipitor over 5 yrs.
As time has passed, I have developed foot, shin, knee, thigh and hip pain.
shoulder, arm and hand pain - am having balance problems, clumsiness and some memory loss.
I have had problem with bloating and flatulence big time.
Dr just took me off Lipitor and Effexor for depression.
only 2 weeks off.
so no noticeable change as yet.
Had an MRI last week to rule out Multiple Sclerosis or any brain problems I HOPE - have not gotten results as yet.
Lipitor reduced my cholesterol total greatly from 274 to 160.
HDL went up and LDL and triglicerides went down.
but looks like the side effects are going to cause me to change meds or quit taking them.
Do the gym 3x a week and walk.
am not totally sedentary and watch what I eat.
but I am a cholesterol mfg.
(so is my sister).
right now, I am just HURTING.
and want to find out WHY.
stay tuned.
