I gradually lost my.
This drug did amazing things with my chloresterol levels, it reduced it from ( Australian standards ) 7.5 to 1.9 ( generally considered OK level is 5.4 ).
However I gradually noticed that during the day I would get very tired, and have to sleep, and I spend a lot of time driving for work, and also my in sex drive became non-existant ( I`m also told very low levels of chloresterol levels does this ).
Had numerous odd aches, especially in the leg area.
Discontinued this drug because of the tiredness factor.
Felt great after a few weeks without it.
