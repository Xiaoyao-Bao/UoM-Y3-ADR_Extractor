I was on Pravachol for about 10 years without any significant reduction in my total cholesterol.
Was switched to Lipitor 40mg initially with fair results and then to 80mg with excellent results.
My present total cholesterol is 160, HDL, LDL and ratios are all acceptable.
Have noticed no side effects.
My only complaint with the drug is the cost and the fact that Pzier has not allowed the generic to be manufactured in the USA until 2012 and yet it is available this year in the UK as a generic.
