Congestion, cough, elbows burning, right heel pain, loss of concentration.
I initially couldn't tell I was taking it.
About two years ago I started waking up with significant congestion with clear phlem.
Chest xray was clear.
My doctor suspected allergies.
Having 2 pets that seemed reasonable.
About a year ago my elbows would burn like fire at times when I rested my arms on a surface.
This would come and go.
I also began having trouble focusing while reading and would skip around.
Two months ago my right heel became painful for no reason.
The more I walked on it the worse it felt.
I switched shoes with no change.
It hurt enough that I began to worry I might end up on disability if it got much worse.
I was recently out of state for two weeks and still had congestion in spite of being in a totally different environment.
That was when I suspected the Lipitor and did some research on line and saw matches with all of my symptoms.
I immediately stopped it and the next morning the congestion was 80% less.
I saw my doctor who agreed I need to stop it.
He explained that there are a lot of side affects and there is no way to predict who will get which ones or when they will develop.
The blood tests give a false sense of security since the results (like mine) can be normal yet other serious issues can develop.
