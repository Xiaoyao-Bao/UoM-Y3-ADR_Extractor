Severe Neck Cramps, Ackey leg cramps too.
Headaches off & on.
Tiredness, crabby with spouse more often.
Can't sleep good at night.

I started out with 10mg, and then 20mg, and then 40mg, before the Doctor saw any good results, but as the milligrams went up i got more & more symptoms, and i had even left my wife due to this drug.
I felt that i was in another world, and i didn't even need her at all.
I finally have been reduced to 20mg again, but still having all the aches, but i am now back with my wife, and have apologies for all of my drug reactions towards her.
We really do have to PAY dearly for getting our HEALTH back people.
So be careful, and PRAY alot more than normal about your health, GOD is listening to you daily.
