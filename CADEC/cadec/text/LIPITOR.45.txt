Cannot be sure it is the drug, but around the time I was on it a month, began having pain on outer sides of thighs.
Knowing some cholesterol meds can cause leg pain my doc did some kind of check on me and said it was not the drug.
Still have those pains, not terrible, just feel like I have been hiking uphill and am fatigued there.
Has done a very good job keeping cholesterol down.
I am going to request lowering the dose w/ the doc.
