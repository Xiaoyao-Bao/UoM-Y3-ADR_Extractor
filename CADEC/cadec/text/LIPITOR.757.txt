First I was having cramps in my fingers, which is now not apparent.
Recently my eyesight is not good, very blurry and my back pain has increased.
My shoulders are inflammed and I am now going to the physiotherapist.
My neck right down to my right shoulder blade is very very sensitive and very very painful.
The pain has not subsided.
I am depressed because of the pain, I can't do what I want to do, I have headaches and can't go to work.
My concentration is poor.
I also have heartburn and indigestion.
I am taking pain relievers and anti-acids.
Lipitor works to reduce my cholesterol from 8 to 5.
My doctor says not to stop, however I did stop for nearly 6 months and I was well.
When I got my cholestoerol measured however it went up and I was concerned so went back on lipitor.
My son says he will find an alternative for me.
Stay tuned.
