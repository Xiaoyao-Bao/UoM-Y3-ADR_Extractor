After taking it for 3-4 months I had terrible pains in knee, ankle, big toe.
Couldn't walk or even sleep comfortably.
I thought I had gout, which runs in my family.
HMO doctors said not gout, but didn't know what.
I finally stumbled on this web site, and thought it might be Lipitor.
I stopped taking it and immediately got some relief.
That was a month and a half ago.
Still have some pain and other weird symptoms (eg. popping) in knee, ankle, big toe joints, but it is gradually getting less.
This drug is too dangerous to use.
We need something with the same good effects, but not the danger.
