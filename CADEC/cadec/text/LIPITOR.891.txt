mostly i suffer restless leg syndrom 30 min. into taking it.
otherwise, first dose i felt better.
be careful if you're on lipitor and your doctor begins to try and put you on medications for high triglycerides.
i was put on tricor and it was extraordinarily horrible.
side effects you can't believe.
we summerized it as a conflict between the lipitor and tricor.
if you must take another med for triglycerides and you begin to feel flu like, cramps in chest, legs, rashes appear, sleep very heavily, sleep alot or feel fatigued consider keeping tabs and if the side effects don't improve or there's more added in 2 weeks time, discontinue doseage.
side effects may increase IE: gums swelling, visual anomalies, numbness in muscles, sore throat, soreness in mucous membrane areas.
