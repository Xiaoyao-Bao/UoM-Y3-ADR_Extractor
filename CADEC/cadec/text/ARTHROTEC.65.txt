Severe, gut-renching abdominal pain, jaundins, diahrea, sweats & hot flashes, vaginal bleeding, and now constipation.
I had to go to the emergency room of local hospital and that's where I learned of the side effects.
From the info on the web about this medication, it should not be given to anyone.
I can't believe it was approved at all.
