Depression, bursitis in left hip didn't respond to 5-6 cortisone shots, PT, toes hurt when sheet touched, MEMORY LOSS-severe, dizzyness, in a FOG bottoms of feet hurt, felt like shin splints,tingling in 2 fingers of left hand.
Went from 1 specialist to another-no one seemed to put it together since I only said those things that related to their specialty.
Finally fingers began to tingle psychiatrist suggested nerve damage.
That niite I got online put in 17 symptoms no matter how unrelated & came up with this site as first choice.
