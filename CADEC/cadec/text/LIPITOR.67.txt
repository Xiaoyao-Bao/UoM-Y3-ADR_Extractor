Severe muscle cramping.
Muscle weakness.
Lipitor dropped my bad cholesterol immediately, however, I have noticed increasing muscle spasms and cramping.
My hands, feet, legs, stomach and back muscles.
I am trying to improve my health yet I can not sleep due to severe leg cramping.
Crippling cramps.
I told my Doc today that I didnt want to take Lipitor any more.
She switched me to another brand that has less of the muscle side effects.
My husband had to pull me out of the bath tub the other night, my thighs would not push me up!
I now know I am not crazy.
fingers twitching, making my mouse click on things I didnt want to click on.
Legs twitching, especially in bed at night.
And the awful cramps!.
