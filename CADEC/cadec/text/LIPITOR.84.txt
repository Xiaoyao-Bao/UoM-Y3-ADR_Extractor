Was doing fine on it for years.
I unfortunately was diagnosed with Colin cancer and had to start chemotherapy.
The combo of chemo and Lipitor caused my liver enzymes to rise, muscle and joint stiffness as well as sore ribs.
I have been off Lipitor for two days and find the muscle stiffness starting to subside.
