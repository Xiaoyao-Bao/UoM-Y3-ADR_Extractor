feeling in a fog, memory problems; muscle weakness in mouth area causing speech difficulties like pronunciation, and chewing/swallowing difficulties like biting my tongue and inside my cheek; muscle weakness in my right hand causing me to lose grip and drop things; balance problems when turning around or standing to walking movements.
I was not informed by my doctor to look out for these symptoms, in fact she did not feel they were connected to the Lipitor.
I know my body and this is not me.
I am going to stop and see what happens.
