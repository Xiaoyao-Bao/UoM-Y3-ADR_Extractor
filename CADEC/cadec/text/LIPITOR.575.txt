Stroke like symptoms.
Numbness and tingling on left side of face and left arm.
Also effected my equilibrium.
My cholesterol was at 190 just before a heart attack.
I was put on 80mg of Lipitor and within 1 week of leaving the hospital I had stroke like symptoms and my doctor immediately stopped the Lipitor.
Within a few days of stopping Lipitor,my equilibrium returned to normal and stroke like symptoms cleared up.
