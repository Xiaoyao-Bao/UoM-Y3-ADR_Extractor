muscle and joint pains--particularly severe at night--lasting even after stopping medication, although decreasing in severity.
I'm distressed that pain continues even after stopping the medication.
I took the medication for 9 months (my doctor said the pains weren't from the Lipitor because there was no indication in the blood work)--finally stopped when could barely walk.
I've been off the medicine for 2 months and pain is less, but still very present, especially in joints.
