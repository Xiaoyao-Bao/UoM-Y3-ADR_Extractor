Muscle tightness, cramping in legs and back.
Problems sleeping and concentrating.
felt like I had the flu much of the time.
Irritable.
I had no perceptable symptoms for about 6 months.
Since this was the only medication I was taking, I quit it and started feeling better within a week.
It took about 3-4 weeks to completely recover from this medicine .
I tried other statins, but had similar bad side effects.
