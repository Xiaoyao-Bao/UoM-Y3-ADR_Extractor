Didn't associate my problems with Lipitor until reading this web site.
I've been on Lipitor for about 7 mos.
Have had problems with my hips and knees in the past but just within the last year I've been experiencing spasms in upper thighs, especially after doing anything physical.
Now I have a dr. apptmt. in a few days because my right knee is so painful I can't even bend it!
It hurts to get up in the morning, get out of a chair, go up stairs.
Also, I have had operations on my right foot a few years ago, but now it hurts almost as much if not more.
The bottom of my foot is extremely tender as are my calves.
The Lipitor did lower my cholesteral wonderfully; but I'm extremely concerned that this may be what my problems are coming from.
Hopefully, the dr. will tell me more this week.
