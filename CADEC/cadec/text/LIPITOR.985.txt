sudden onset severe depression.
It worked very well the first time it was prescribed and I lost 20 pounds using it with exercise and diet.
When this medication was combined with a SSRI it failed to reduce my HDL cholesterol in a meaningful amount and it caused intense anxiety attacks and short periods of intense depression.
