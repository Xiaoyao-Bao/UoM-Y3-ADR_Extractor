Joint pain in the knees and hips.
Pain in the shoulders.
A tingling sensation in the back of my neck.
Tinnitus.
Weak muscles.
Lipitor did lower my cholesterol, and I had no side effects for 2.5 years.
Now my legs , shoulders, and hips ache.
The most acute pain is in the legs.
Stiffness is more prevalent in he morning.
Getting out of bed is painful.
The nurse practitioner did admit that these side effects can occur after 2 to 3 years.
She suggested that I stop taking it for a few weeks.
I stopped 2 months ago, and will not take it again.
The tingling in the neck has stopped, but the leg and shoulder pain has not abated.
I am 70 years old, weigh 167 lbs, exercise daily, don't smoke, and eat fruits and vegetables.
I drink wine in moderation, haven't drank coffee or tea in over 20 years, but I do eat red meat in moderation.
I will take my chances with elevated levels of high cholesterol, and only hope that the muscle damage is not permanent.
