Trouble walking, hard to pick up feet and balance is off at times.
Pain in muscles of both upper arms.
Arms feel HEAVY and hands are tingling and somewhat numb.
Have trouble holding on to things.
I have been off Lipitor 1 year and 2 months.
Have been to several specialists.
I feel Lipitor has taken away my life.
