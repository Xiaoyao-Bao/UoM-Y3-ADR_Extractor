no stomach pains - no excessive drowsiness but slept well- I took medicine during dinner on a full stomach.
My left foot was hurting badly enough that I couldn't walk without hobbling.
Several hours after taking medicine most of the pain disappeared, and I am back to normal.
Great success, I'd say!.
