MY DOCTOR PRESCRIBED 10MG OF LIPITOR 3 YEARS AGO.
THIS PAST SEPTEMBER HE INCREASED THE DOSAGE TO 20mg.
SHORTLY AFTER, I BECAME EXTREMELY FATIGUED AND HAD HEADACHES.
I HAD TO LEAVE WORK AROUND 1 PM DAILY.
I WENT BACK TO THE DOCTOR.
HE SAID IT COULD BE MY THYROID.
BLOOD TEST WAS NORMAL.
THE DR DIDN'T LOOK FURTHER.
I THEN STARTED TO EXPERIENCE KNEE PAIN,,,SEVERE KNEE PAIN.
MY DAUGHTER FORWARDED THIS WEB SITE TO ME & I BELIEVE IT'S SAVING MY LIFE.
I CALLED MY DR AND TOLD HIM THAT I KNEW IT WAS THE LIPITOR EFFECTING ME.
HE TOLD ME TO STOP TAKING IT FOR 2 WEEKS,,,,I'VE BEEN OFF THE LIPITOR FOR 1 WEEK.
THE KNEE PAIN HAS GREATLY SUBSIDED AND I'M LESS FATIGUED.
THE HEADACHES ARE GONE.
