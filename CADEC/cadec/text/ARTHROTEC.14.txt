Initially, I experienced a slight, but noticeable difference in pain level: the pain was less severe.
Within a few days, I noticed acid reflux shortly after taking, and it got progressively worse.
It got to the point that I was apprehensive about going to bed; I consistently found myself waking up with acidic bile in my mouth, tasting like I had thrown up.
