Extreme Right Shoulder Pain, more pronounced at night to the point I wake up frequently because the pain wakes me up.
Also experiencing short term memory loss, irratibility and fatigue.
On advice from Dr went off it for a week but did not experience any relief.
It did significantly lower LDL and HDL levels but tired of pain.
MD will probably send me to Orthopedic Specialist upon next visit.
Additionaly taking 6mg folic acid and B6 to combat high homosysteine levels.
