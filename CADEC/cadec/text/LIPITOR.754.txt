Jaundice,right upper quadrant abdominal pain,very elevated liver function tests,itching of the skin,weakness,loss of appetite.
Gall bladder sonogram,CT scan,MRI of liver ducts all negative for gall bladder disease.
Hospitalized 4 days.
six weeks after stopping Lipitor all liver tests returned to normal.
.
I am a retired physician and had an excellent therepeutic result while on the medication.
I did have occcasional muscle aches and flu like symptoms which subsided when a stopped lipitor for short periods of time.
But the overall good effect of the drug on my lipid profile caused me to return to using it.
Not any more!
I could have wound up with permanent liver damage or dying.
The drug isert for lipitor does mention cholestatic Jaundice in the post market studies.
no numbers as to the number of cases reported.
How many go unreported?.
