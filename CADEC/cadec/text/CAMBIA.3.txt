Tastes gross -- heavy mint flavor.
Felt like it was burning my esophagus all the way down, then dry heaves once it hit my stomach.
But it didn't make me actually vomit, and the burning sensation went away quickly.
Was prescribed Cambia as a backup to Maxalt, since triptans can be taken only 2 days/week.
Unfortunately, it didn't work at all on my migraines, so I'll continue to look for something else as a backup.
