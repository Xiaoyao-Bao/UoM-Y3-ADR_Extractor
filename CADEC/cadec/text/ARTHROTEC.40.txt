I have been concerned about long term effects of Arthrotec, but with chronic back for 9 years I cannot live without it right now.
I was shocked to read some of the comments on this website.
I never had any stomach trouble, or cramps, or anything people have mentioned here.
People mentioned Celebrex.
A friend of mine developed an ulcer after only a short time on Celebrex.
I do not have any kind of stomach trouble after 8 years.
Would I rather not take it?
Of course, but I have to be able to get out of the bed in the morning.
I have blood work done every year to see if there's any kidney, liver damage or anything, and so far there hasn't been any.
I would recommend it.
