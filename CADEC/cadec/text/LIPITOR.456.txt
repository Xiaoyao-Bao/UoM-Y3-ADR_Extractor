intense calf pain, swollen feet & ankles, memory loss.
Yes it did lower cholesterol and LDL but June 04 dosage increased from 20 mg to 40 mg per day because ldl had elevated again and Dr wanted ldl @ 70 and mine was at 114.
Been off Lipitor since 08-23-04 due to severe calf pain.
ldl is now 211.
10-13-04 Dr put me on niaspan 500 mg to start.
He is not happy, like I was!!!!!!!!.
