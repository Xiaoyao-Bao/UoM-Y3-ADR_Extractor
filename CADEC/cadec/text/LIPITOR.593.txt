I was on Lipitor for 3 years with no problems.
Then I sated having hip/leg/foot pain and numbness.
It finally go so bad that I could not sleep lying down.
Also, bouts of nausia.
I went off the lipitor and within 3 days the pains were going away, 10 days and all was well.
It is a great med as long as you don't have the side effects.
My MD says that it is soluble in fat and builds up in the muscle.
He switched me to Crestor, similar med, but water soluble so it doesn't build up in your body as much.
So far so good.
