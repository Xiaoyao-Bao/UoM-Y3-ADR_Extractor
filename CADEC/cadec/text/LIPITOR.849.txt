After three months on Lipitor, I started to feel like an airhead -- slightly dizzy virtually all the time and frequently unable to think clearly.
I actually started to wonder if I were developing early Alzheimer's (I'm 58).
After five months, I developed severe pain in my thighs and knees and I'm exhausted all the time.
So far my blood tests have been normal, but now that I've read these posts, I'm going to stop taking Lipitor.
It did lower my total cholesterol from 235 to 200.
