My doctor says my cholesterol levers are lower.
so that's good.
But I've been feeling like my mind is fading away.
and it's a scary sensation, when I can't remember the names of co-workers when I'm talking to them!
I feel like I'm much older and mentally weaker which is a pretty high price just to lower my cholesterol.
Others have mentioned the.
I've stopped taking it - to see what happens.
I was taking 10mg once a day.
I'm still on Lisinopril (10mg) and Hydrochlorothiazide (12.5mg) each once a day - taken with the Lipitor.
