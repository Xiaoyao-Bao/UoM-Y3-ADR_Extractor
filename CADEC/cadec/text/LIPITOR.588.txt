Pain in hip, lower back, knees & elbow.
Stiffness in lower back and legs when getting up in the morning.
Excercise intolerance and general muscle weakness.
I ask my doctor about these pains months ago and he said lipitor would not cause my problems.
However, after reading the common side effects with others on this site, I will stop this medication immediately, it not worth feeling like an old man at age 46!.
