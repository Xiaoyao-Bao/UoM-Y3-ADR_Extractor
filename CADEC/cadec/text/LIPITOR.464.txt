I had severe muscle pain and weakness after taking only a few doses of Lipitor.
My legs were so weak and tired I could hardly walk up and down my stairs.
I went off the drug for a few days and all the symptoms subsided.
At my doctor's suggestion, I went on Lipitor again and experienced the same symptoms.
This was with only a small dosage (I think it was 10mg).
I could not function; I have never felt such weakness.
I am now taking Zocor, which certainly has side effects, but I can function.
