Over the course of the past year I've experienced, short term memory loss, extreme fatigue,joint pain, especially in my knees.
I also had reflux, that until I found this site, thought it was unrelated.
Doc put me on Lipitor, when I complained that Tricor was making me tired.
Lipitor was 10X WORSE !!!.
I WILL NEVER TAKE ANY STATIN EVER AGAIN !!
Since I found this site--I thought all the symptoms were caused by other things.
Now I know that Tricor started the problems, Lipitor made them much worse.
NATURAL SUPPLEMENTS ARE THE WAY TO GO !!
Just Google Natural Alternatives for Lipitor .
I've been off this killer drug for 6 weeks, and feel great !!
No fatigue, memory is back, knees still hurt, but hopefully, they rebound too.
Doctor is PISSED-----I'M THRILLED !!!.
