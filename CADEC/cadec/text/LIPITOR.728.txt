This is the result of taking 1 pill a day for 12 days: On day 3, I felt stabbing pain above a knee.
Thought I had somehow injured it - but the pain vanished in a day.
The next day, I felt stabbing pain in my spine and I thought I had thrown my back out.
I was hunched over to the left and figured it would take a week to get better, but the pain vanished after a little more than a day.
I started feeling an odd sensation in the center back of my calves.
I put weight on suddenly for no reason and ringing in my left ear increased.
Next the calf sensation turned painful at night and started increasing.
I figured out these issues all might be caused by Lipitor and stopped taking it immediately.
But the pain in my calves continued to get worse for several days!
My legs were waking me up at night and were all contorted.
I've never experienced anything like it but the nurse said,.
