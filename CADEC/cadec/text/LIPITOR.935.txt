My elder brother, who has expired 15 days back in the age of 54 years, was put on the same medicine for blood pressure in the age of 45 years which definitely resulted into causing him ALS in the last three years before his tragic death without any cure.
He developed the symptoms like stiffness in whole body, loss of balance, no power to standup himself, loss of weight, acute weakness in the muscles of whole body and their dilution in size, constipitation, no control over urination and in the last 20 days before the death, he suffered with loss of vocal sound, choking the throat, looseness in the body structure, complete stopage of easing out and lungs detoriation like less intake of oxigen leading to his painful death in the last time.
I strongly feel the lipitor had the crucial side effect upon my brother causing him to suffer with ALS for which there is reportedly no cure in Allopathy , while therefore i put my brother on Homeopathitic treatment which at least avoided the bad effect.
Please avoid the allopathic treatment and follow the Yoga-sustem or regular phyical exercise to prevent the diseases.
