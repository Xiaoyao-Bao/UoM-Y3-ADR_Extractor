Daily headaches.
I also started on hormones and thought that might be causing them but as I'm reading this I'm thinking it's the Lipitor.
I haven't been on it long enough to know if it reduces my cholesterol but even if it does I don't know if I'll continue to take it if the headaches don't go away.
