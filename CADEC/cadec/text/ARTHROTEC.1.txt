I feel a bit drowsy & have a little blurred vision, so far no gastric problems.
I've been on Arthrotec 50 for over 10 years on and off, only taking it when I needed it.
Due to my arthritis getting progressively worse, to the point where I am in tears with the agony, gp's started me on 75 twice a day and I have to take it.
every day for the next month to see how I get on, here goes.
So far its been very good, pains almost gone, but I feel a bit weird, didn't have that when on 50.
