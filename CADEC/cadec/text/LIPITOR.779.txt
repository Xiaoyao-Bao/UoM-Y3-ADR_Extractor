within 3 days I experienced extreme muscle pain and weakness.
I felt like I was walking though sludge.
For the next 2 weeks I only wanted to sleep.
I have no energy.
My blood work indicates trouble with my liver.
I have repeated the test every week since discontinuing the drug and it has not returned to normal yet.
I am now experiencing edema-swelling of the hands, feet, legs etc I am taking lasiks trying to eleviate this.
40 mg per day is not taking it away yet.
It has been nearly 2 weeks since the swelling began.
I am truly concerned about any permanent damage this medication my have caused.
After only 3 10mg doses I have suffered a month of side effects!
I wouldn't recommend this to anyone!
If you are taking it now and experience anything unusual at all, contact your doctor immediately!
I feared I might be over reacting to the muscle ache!
I don't know where I'd be if I had continued taking lipitor beyond the 3 days!!!.
