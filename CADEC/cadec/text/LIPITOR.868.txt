Severe headache, joint and muscle pain, anorexia, extreme gas, memory loss, mood swings.
I had a LAD artery 100% blocked a couple years ago and suffered a miocardial infarction.
The pain was unbearable and the pain from the headache Lipitor caused was WORSE!
I've taken Zocor, Crestor and had similar problems with side effects, but i thought Lipitor was going to cause my death.
NEVER again!.
