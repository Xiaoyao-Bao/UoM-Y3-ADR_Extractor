My heart beats went to 30 or a little less stomack heart lungs heart and hard to breath I hert from head to my toe .
I thought I was going to die for 2 days and nights.
After I got out of hospital I have trouble doing anything like I was doing.
I think lipitor and maybe even any statin drugs should be takenoff the market.
I'll never take anything with statin in it agin.
