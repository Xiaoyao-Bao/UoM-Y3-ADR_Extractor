Started with muscle pain and weakness, which I thought was due to my age and job.
When my doctor got around to checking my liver enzymes, they were sky-high.
My doctor said to stop taking Lipitor immediately.
When the pain and fatigue continued, the doctor seemed surprised.
The problems continued, and a specialist did a muscle biopsy.
It showed permanent, irreversible muscle damage.
The good news - the muscle damage shouldn't get any worse.
