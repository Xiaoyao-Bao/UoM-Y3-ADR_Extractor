Lots of stomach gurgling after eating, which has been consistent even after adjusting to the medication, and initial doses gave diarrhea for a few days.
I have switched to taking it with a snack before bedtime with good results.
For me, it has been very effective pain relief for my chronic bone/joint pain from a broken elbow.
So effective that I was able to substantially reduce the amount of narcotic pain reliever I was using once the Voltaren kicked in after about 2 days.
