Severe muscle pain in shoulders radiating through the chest, cramping in back muscles, calves and hamstrings.
Severe muscle pain after working out with weights, all the while losing strength.
Difficulty with memory at times (i.e. remembering a name or a word).
My shoulder pain resulted in a visit to a specialist who said inflammation was present but no torn rotator cuff.
Prescribed physical therapy which made it hurt even more.
I first noticed the pain several months in to taking the drug.
After an ER visit due to severe back spasm/cramp, my Cardiologist suggested going off the drug and in the past 10 days, no cramping, the shoulder pain has eased 80% and I actually feel good.
Because of blockage issues I need to move on to another drug like Crestor or Zocar but after reading some of the comments I am concerned.
The medication worked at lowering my cholesterol (127 with good cholesterol over 40 and bad cholesterol under 70) but at a steep price physically.
