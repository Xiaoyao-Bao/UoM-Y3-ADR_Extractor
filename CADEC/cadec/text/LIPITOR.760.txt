After almost 1 year on 10 mg/day, woke up one morning with right foot turned at right angle.
Unable to straighten it and doctors unable to find a reason for it.
Walked like that for about six months with increasing pain, especially in right thigh which felt.
I'm so disillusioned with the drug companies and the FDA that I won't take anything my doctor recommends again.
Lipitor has robbed me and my family of my former active self and I have no idea whether I will ever return to normal.
Will try the CoQ10 idea and also physical therapy to try to realign everything from my hips down so I can move normally again.
DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!
IT IS NOT WORTH TRADING YOUR QUALITY OF LIFE FOR A LOWER CHOLESTEROL NUMBER!!!
I too would like to join a class action suit, as I feel Pfizer was well aware of the damage this drug could do.
