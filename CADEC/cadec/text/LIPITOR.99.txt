Torn ham string.
Had months of aquatic therapy & it did not help.
Finally I had such pain in both legs in my upper thigh and upper leg by my hip area that I could hardly stand it.
I had noticed 5 years prior to this that my muscles seemed to never feel the same as before I started on a statin drug.
I kept thinking is this old age.
It got so bad that I could hardly walk after sitting for any period of time.
I finally called my doctor and was advised to stop the statin drug.
It took a few months for the pain to subside.
I took 40 Mg for 10 years.
It brought my cholestrol down but I could not stand all of the muscle pain.
