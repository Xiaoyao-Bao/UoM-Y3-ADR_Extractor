Stabbing pain between shoulder blades, I am 52 and feel 82, no energy, muscle tone depletion, strength depletion, numbness in upper legs from knee to thigh, pain and numbness in left foot, left foot larger than right now by one size, pain in feet, need special shoes just to walk now, I feel like I will not be alive next year.
I've been on this for 5 years, and am going to quit after finding this website.
Doctors did nothing for me.
They have no idea what this drug does to people!
Time to exercise, eat healthy food, and get OFF this stuff.
Thank you everyone for taking the time to post, and helping me understand what was happening.
Hate this stuff.
Crestor just as bad.
