This drug makes me so agitated--insomnia, hideously increased muscle tension, short tempered, impatient.
It really helped with pain in hand & arm, but the agitation is unbearable.
I got spasms in my back from it and had to get therapy for those.
I know it doesn't make sense with the tiny dose I'm taking, & they say no systemic effects from the topical gel, but I've gone on & off it 4 or 5 times now and the effects when using it are unmistakeable.
