I HAVE BEEN ON LIPITOR, 10 MG FOR 1 1/2 YEARS NOW AND AM NOW EXPERIENCING ANKLE, CALF, THIGH PAIN.
SOMETIMES IT FEELS LIKE EVERYTHING ON MY BODY HURTS.
SHOLDERS, HANDS, I CHALKED IT UP TO BEING 58 AND MAYBE ARTHRITIS BUT AFTER READING ALL OF THE VIEWS FROM OTHERS ON LIPITOR I AM CONSIDERING STOPPING IT TO SEE IF I GET MY OLD SELF BACK AGAIN.
I TOO, AM VERY TIRED LATELY AND NEVER FEEL RESTED UPON AWAKINENING.
MY CHOLESTEROL ALSO CAME DOWN FROM 250 TO 150 BUT I DID FEEL BETTER AND HAD ALOT MORE ENERGY A 1 1/2 AGO.
I WILL MENTION THIS TO MY DOCTOR TO SEE WHAT HE HAS TO SAY.
