Oddly, only positive.
I seem to sleep better and have lots of interesting dreams.
No adverse effects.
Was on Niacin (500mg) for 90 days, but showed no improvement.
Tried Tricor for about 8 days, but couldn't deal with the side-effects (sore joints, sleeplessness, gas).
Been on 20mg Lipitor for 30 days now, but won't know any benefit for another 60 days.
