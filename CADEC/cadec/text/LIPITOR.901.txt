I only took Lipitor a short time then was switched to Zocor.
Leg cramps, fatique, overall weak feeling.
I quit taking the Statin drug 2 years ago.
I went to American Heart lung ass. website and put in my 10 year risk factor.
By dropping my total cholesterol from 259 down to 200 only reduced my risk factor by 1%.
I showed this and other info to my Doctor and she understood and said it was my choice.
I feel normal today and will never take these drugs again.
Here is site to check your risk factor. http://www.fda.gov/opacom/backgrounders/problem.html
Also I found out you should report side effects to FDA at. http://www.fda.gov/opacom/backgrounders/problem.html
They estimate only 20% to 30% of drug side effects get reported.
I encourage everyone to report their experiences with these drugs.
(We have to the Doctors don't).
These Statins are dangerous over perscribed drugs.
