Severe chronic fatigue, muscle weakness, problems with memory, concentration.
Severe depression.
Cholesterol went down drastically, doctors were thrilled, but I spent a year feeling exhausted and weak, unable to find words or remember names or follow the plot of a movie.
All I thought about was where and when I could lie down.
I was hardly able to lift things I could easily lift before.
Legs would go wobbly after one flight of stairs.
Everything was exhausting.
Doing the shopping or vacuuming was like climbing Everest.
Symptoms stopped within a week of stopping Lipitor.
I can't believe I spent a year of my life like that.
I will not recommend against Lipitor because some people do fine on it but I wish my Drs. had been more open to the idea that it was causing me problems.
The only side effect they asked about was muscle pain, which I didn't have, and I was basically told Lipitor doesn't cause anything else.
