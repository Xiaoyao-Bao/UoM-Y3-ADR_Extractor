inflamatory muscle pain and soreness in upper back, head pain and pressure and the feeling of being in a fog.
EXTREMELY DANGEROUS DRUG!
I have never had these problems until I started Lipitor.
I have discontinued it 2 weeks ago with now a 40% reduction in side effects but the pain is still really bad.
Does anyone know how long it will take for the side effects to completely go away?
Will they go away?
Lipitor lowered my cholesterol from 268 to 163 but it nearly killed me in return.
It's not worth it.
The doctor told me I was imagining all this and said it was so safe it should be in the drinking water supply.
Can you believe that!
This drug is an extremely dangerous poison.
The Pfizer website is very low-key about the side effects.
You better take matters into your own hands as Pfizer's only concern is profits - NOT your health.
