Most of the side effects everyone else has: weak legs, muscle and back soreness, ears ringing, feel bad, all usually in the mornings.
However, it lowered my cholesterol, tryglycerides, and blood pressure, along with a lot of exercising.
I had by-pass surgery in 1986, angioplasty in the mid 90's, started on Zocor, then my doctor switched me to Lipitor and have not had to have either since I started on the statins.
(started with 20mg. then 40mg., and now 80mg.)
Its not perfect, but it keeps me alive.
I am now 65 and I thank God every single day for my doctor and my medicine.
I just gut it up and make my self jog a mile and walk a mile 4-5 times a week, pain or no pain.
I have lived to see my grandchildren and two great grandchildren.
Life is good.
Think positive!.
