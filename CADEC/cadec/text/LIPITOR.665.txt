Hell on earth.
Took 10 mg for three weeks and stopped.
Will be seeing my doctor in four days and will tell him what I think, It's dangerous stuff.
Will never touch this junk again.
Asked my pharmacist about all the pain especially back, he said it couldn't be the Lipitor!
Really.

I will probably have to take a blood test but, the results will have no bearing on my decision.
No Lipitor, there is something very wrong with it.
I'm only 40 yrs old and I felt like 90, on the verge of death.
I couldn't move because of the pain, couldn't sleep or woke up at 11am and could get out of bed, made very irrational moves while driving, couldn't remember where I left my dog 10 minutes before or who I had dinner with last night, had miniscus surgery 3 months ago and now it is painful again, constipation and stomach pain, always hungry.
GREAT STUFF.
I'll take my chances without it thanks.
Quality of life is more important a number, and I can't stand the smell of tiger balm anymore!!
I think more reseach is needed, something is not right here.
