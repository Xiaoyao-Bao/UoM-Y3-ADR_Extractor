After taking Lipitor for a number of years my muscles and joints in my legs and shoulders gradually became very painful.
My arms are so weak I can hardly lift them.
I stopped taking the drug for about a month.
Symptoms have decreased but I am worried I have caused permanent damage to my shoulder joints.
I also cannot concentrate like I used to I get tired vry easily.
Lipitor reduced my cholesterol, but the side effects are too great.
