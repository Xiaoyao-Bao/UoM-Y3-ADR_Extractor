1st pill taken with food, a few hours after i experienced shortness of breath, a sense of depression, cramping, upset stomache will stop taking immediately.
Honestly can not recommend this drug, I am still experiencing side effects just after 1 pill and im supposed to take twice/day 75mg.
I just cant keep going have to try something else.
