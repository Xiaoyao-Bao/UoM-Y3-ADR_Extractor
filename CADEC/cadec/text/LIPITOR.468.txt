Started on lipitor about 6 months ago.
2-3 weeks ago I went to MD with sore neck/arms (especially left) feeling of breathlessness and anxiety, feeling like something was going to happen.
MD told me I was depressed and said Lipitor was not the problem.
I decided to do some research myself and found this website.
I immediately stopped taking lipitor a day ago and am experiencing weakness in both arms especially left.
I am very jittery and tingly and itchy.
I feel like I am climbing the walls.
This is a terrible medicine!!!
I will never take it again!!
It should be taken off the shelves!!!.
