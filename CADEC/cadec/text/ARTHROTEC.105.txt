I've been on 75mg twice daily for 13 days, with recent body swelling, face, wrists, abdomen, thighs - clothes fit tight.
Insomina is much worse.
I have forgetfulnes and confussion - really bad - almost dangerous.
Have felt "empty stomach" feeling, but not bothersome.
Have had more loose stools, but tolerable.
I'm looking for a more natural therapy, checking into HA (Hyaluronic Acid) to replace Arthrotec.
