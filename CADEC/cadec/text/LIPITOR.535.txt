serious hands & feet cramping, weakness, painful inflamation of joints/knuckles and significant strength reduction.
persistent feeling of tiredness and overall muscle soreness/weakness/fatigue.
All symptoms worse upon waking.
I significanlty lowered my chol by using 10mg lipitor and excercising.
However, for months I attributed all my pains to my busy schedule and my exercise routine.
I went from a 36 year-old who can do 60 min of cardio/45 min of free weights every other day, to someone who can barely pick up his 15 mo. son.
My life right now is a disaster.
I've been off it 2 weeks and the pain has only subsided 20%.
I can barely walk when I wake in the morning.
I cannot get anything done around the house.
My life right now is depressing until I get back to normal.
All exercise has ceased and my wife picks up the slack for chores around the house that I cannot do.
I HAVE NEVER experienced symptoms like these in my life.
I am hoping this goes away soon and doesn't cause any long term damage.
I cannot say that I'd do it over again.
In fact, at my risk, I doubt I'll take any meds willingly if I can.
Drug companies really downplay the side effects.
I know how this goes, I work with stats too!.
