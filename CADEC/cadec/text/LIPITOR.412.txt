incredible depression almost immediately after I started taking it.
crying all the time, not sleeping, reliving of past terrible events that had occurred in my life, like someone pushing a doorbell and holding it to keep ringing and reliving all the terrible negative things in my life over and over again.
I kept asking my doctor if there were any side effects like mine and he said no.
I had been taking zocor with no problem but insurance company wouldn't pay for it anymore and made me go on lipitor.
After about six months I had my docteor write a letter to ins. co. saying I couldn't take lipitor and they agreed to put me back on zocor.
But the long term effect of those six months sent me into a psyhcological tailspin that I never recovered from.
I went to three psychiatrist and they finally came up with a diagnoses of bipolar disorder.
Cause unknown.
This was three years ago.
The drug ruined my life, I am now seperated after this all occurred and before the lipitor I was an energtic happy family man with a great wife and two kids.
I know it was the lipitor because the only other medication I take is an aspirin once a day.
