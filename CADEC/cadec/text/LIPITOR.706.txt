Liver enzymes became elevated after taking the cholesterol-lowering medicines (Mevacor and Lipitor) for approximately 9 years.
The Lipitor was great at lowering my cholesterol and improving the ratio of my HDL's to LDL's; however, on the advice of my doctor I have discontinued taking Lipitor for the time being.
I didn't realize that I haven't been feeling well, until I stopped taking the Lipitor and now feel like my old self again.
It's hard to explain, but I have a better sense of well-being and I've actually lost a few pounds even though I have not changed my diet.
I feel less bloated, and my stomach feels more comfortable.
