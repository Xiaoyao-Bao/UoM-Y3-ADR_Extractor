Back pain, Lipitor seems to be involved.
In November of 2005 I was prescribed Lipitor for elevated cholesterol.
Not really high, but high enough, dosage was only 20 mg per day.
Within two months, I had developed wicked back pain, along with neuropathy and hypersensitivity that wrapped around my abdomen.
We suspected the Lipitor was involved, so I went off it, since my numbers had gotten really low.
I was effectively laid up for about six months.
Since there was no immediate improvement, we surmised that Lipitor wasn't causing this.
It's October 2006 now, and I'm starting to feel more like myself, still hurts but I can work around it.
The cholesterol has crept up, so two weeks ago we started the Lipitor again, and within a few days I was paractically flat on my back again!
So, I've stopped again.
It's a bloody shame this is happening, as the drug was extremely effective in dropping that cholesterol.
Too bad, we're going to have to try something else, I guess.
