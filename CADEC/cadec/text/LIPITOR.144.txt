the muscle spasms in my legs were so bad I had difficulty climbing 4 stairs - highly unusual for me.
you need to keep on top of these drugs because the dr. doesn't always monitor enough.
I wouldn't have known what was wrong with me if I hadn't seen an ad on t.v. for this med. describing side effects.
Dr said it was vitamin C deficiency.
I stopped the lipitol and the symptoms went away.
I would have believed the dr. if it weren't for a kind pharmacist who said I should get a second opinion.
