HORRIBLE muscle pains, horrible back spasms,spasms in leg muscles, nausea, vomiting, pain so bad that I could hardly walk or sit.
chest pains, so bad that I ended up in the emergency room 2x not knowing what it was from.
One Doctor finally took a blood test and told me it was from the lipitor.

NEVER NEVER TAKE THIS DRUG.
I am hoping that I did not hurt myself permanently by taking it.
don't know what to do to find out .
