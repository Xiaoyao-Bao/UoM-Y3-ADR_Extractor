None that I noticed.
I did take my blood pressure today though, and it was slightly elevated from the norm.
I suspect the drug is responsible, but as I am only taking it short-term, I am not overly concerned.
I had acute shoulder tendonitis and was in absolute agony.
Within 24 hours of taking this medicine, the inflammation was reduced dramatically and I have continued to improve, gaining back more of my range of motion with each day.
