I am left with chest pain, muscle weakness and spasms and I am up every 3 hrs drinking water.
Drs. laugh when I say that I have Rhabdomyolosis - my Cpk or ck or whatever it is is fine.
but no one cks the myoglobin or hemoglogin in urine.
I'm desparate for a Dr in Mn. that will do that.
I don't know where to turn and get sicker and sicker.
Am afraid my heart will go.
The drug gets cholestorel down, but ruins your life.
