After about 4 months of taking Lipitor, one day while walking, my left leg, below the knee, experienced intense pain and stiffness.
Symtoms have persisted for a week and after reading the comments on this board, I am stopping it.
While it worked well by lowering my cholesterol, I had no idea this was a side affect.
