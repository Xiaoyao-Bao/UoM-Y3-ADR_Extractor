none with light stomich ake sometimes.
a little shortness of breath at times.
this product changed the way i have lived for 5 years.
i had a back operation 20 years ago and my time of mobility was going from bad to worse.
absolutly changed my life.
i can go all day.
there is one thing that i need to look into.
my mother in law has rematoid arthro.
she walked into the emergancy room and is hooked up to a machine to keep her alive for now .
one week.
she had an alergic reaction to the medicine she had been taken for her arthritice.
she had been taken it for two years.
and i do not know what to do.
she has an infection in her lungs and lost all capassity.
but the only thing i know is that it was not arthrotec,but can it all be the same?.
