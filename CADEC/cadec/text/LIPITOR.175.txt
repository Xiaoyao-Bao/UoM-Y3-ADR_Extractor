rapid shallow breathing, fatigue, disorientation, slightly blurred vision, erectile disfunction, muscle pain.
My GP and a respiratory specialist were totally unable to diagnose the problem.
I tried stopping each med I was taking, some allergy/asthma stuff and Lipitor.
All the symptoms largely disappeared after two days off Lipitor.
Took months for lingering effects to clear completely.
Anyone taking Lipitor and showing any undiagnosed symptoms, should be taken off Lipitor for awhile as a test.
