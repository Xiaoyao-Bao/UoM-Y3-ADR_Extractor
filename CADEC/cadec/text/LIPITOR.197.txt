None that I am aware of.
This drug has been extremely helpful to me so far.
I've been on it over a year now.
It significantly lowered my cholesterol within 3 months, which shocked me.
To be fair, I am on 3 other medications, so if I was to have any side effects I wouldn't know what to attribute it to anyway.
But so far so excellent.
