slurring in speech, lower back pain, bloated, constipated and severe hip pain on both hips.
Memory loss and fatigue and muscle weakness and depression, and sleepless nites.
Sight loss and very off balance.
This is so weird, I came on this site due to wanting to know why I was having the hip pain and feeling like .
! This is the 2nd time I got on Lipitor.
Dummy me, got off cause I was not feeling good taking it and was going to have surgery so I got off a couple of months after taking it a couple of months and did feel better.
Both times I have taken Lipitor, I have gotten some lower back pain (almost like a disc out of place)impossible to move.
After reading this, I am sure that Lipitor is causing all this.
I did feel better health and mood and no pain before I started taking this Lipitor both times.
I am amazed that it didn't dawn on me.
Have a 5 month supply but getting off quick!.
