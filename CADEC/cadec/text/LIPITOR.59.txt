Over the years, I had previously been prescribed steroid nasal sprays, allegra (even though tests showed no allergies), nexium, cough medicine, sinus irrigation, & various sleeping pills to deal with what I now know was my reaction to statins.
Nothing helped alleviate these symptoms.
Besides the toll that statins have taken on my quality of life, I've also spent tens of thousands of dollars on doctors, drugs, tests, labs, & procedures.
I even purchased a sleep number bed & a new sofa, thinking that would help my insomnia & back pain.
All to no avail.
My symptoms slowly crept up during my 15 years of statin use.
Just 2 years ago, I walked 4 miles a day, or rode my bike for 45 minutes a day.
I did a 20 minute Pilates machine workout 4 or 5 times a week.
I went from being energetic & very active to being unable to even do my own grocery shopping.
Since my daughter will be having her 2nd child in 3 months & will need my help & since I was afraid that I would be wheel chair bound by then if my symptoms kept worsening, I stopped taking Lipitor 12 days ago & I began improving slightly by the 3rd day.
I informed my doctor, who was not happy-he now wants me to "try" pravachol!
Now 12 days post-lipitor, the hot flashes & night sweats are gone entirely.
I am sleeping 5-6 hours at night, instead of 3-4.
The weakness in my legs & back when climbing steps is lessening.
My arm muscles st.
