8 hours after taken voltaren, I had a severe allergic reaction.
My skin felt like it was moving, and the itch on my head, genitals and lips was excruciating.
My lips started to swell, then my tongue.
Luckily I had an epipen in the medicine cupboard, and that saved me.
I had taken this medication many times before for gout and a bit of arthritis.
This was the first time I had the reaction.
I am now severely allergic to NSAIDs.
