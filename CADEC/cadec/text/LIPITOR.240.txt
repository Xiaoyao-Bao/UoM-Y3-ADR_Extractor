Big problems with muscle cramps and numbness in my legs progressing to difficulty walking up stairs and swollen feet and ankles.
Some of this could be other meds or combinations but I didn't have these problems before starting Lipitor.
Statins are supposed to be the new miracle drug to keep us all alive for years longer.
What a joke.
Who would want to live like this?
I have been off all my meds for about a week and feeling much better.
I know it's dangerous but so are the drugs.
