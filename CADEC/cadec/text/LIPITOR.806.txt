After approx 5 years of Lipitor, I have been experiencing severe pains in my arms.
Cardiologist suggested coming off Lipitor to see if this was the problem.
Off 2 weeks now and definitely better, almost gone.
Now wondering about statin induced myopathy.
Also take Cozaar for high BP and Bisoprolol for heart rythm.
Tiredness exists.
always put that down to the stresses of life.
