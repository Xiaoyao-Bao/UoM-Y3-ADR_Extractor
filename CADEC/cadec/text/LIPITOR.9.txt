Cramps in my feet, pain in the lower part of my knees, fatigue, mental fog.
During the three years that I was taking Lipitor, my cholesterol averaged as follows (n = 5) all units mg/dL: Total Cholesterol - 140 HDL - 38 LDL - 74 Triglycerides - 139 Total/HDL Ratio - 3.67
After stopping Lipitor and all other statins in 2010: Total Cholesterol - 218 HDL - 34 LDL - 184 Triglycerides - 167 Total/HDL ratio - 6.4
After switching to 10 mg Simvistatin: Total Cholesterol - 136 HDL - 38 LDL - 70 Triglycerides - 138 Total/HDL ratio - 3.58
I take 1/2 of a 20 mg generic Simvistatin pill daily.
Very little side effects, cheaper, and does the same job as Lipitor.
