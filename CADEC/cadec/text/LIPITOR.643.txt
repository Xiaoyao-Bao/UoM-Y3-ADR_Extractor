blurring eyesight, hair loss, painful leg cramps, muscle weakness in my left arm, hard to walk any length of time, my legs and ankles ache so bad, have been unable to lose weight even when on strict diet, very, very tired all the time; pain in almost every muscle, digestive changes, bloating, gas, diarhea.
My doctor keeps insisting that it isn't the drug.
But all of these symptoms have come on since taking Lopid and Lipitor.
Especially the eyesight problems, even went and bought new glasses and hasn't helped!!
The fatigue and muscle weakness are the worst.
Am only in my 40's and feel like I'm in my 80's!!
Am going to stop taking the drug and see if the symptoms improve.
In spite of what my quack says!!.
