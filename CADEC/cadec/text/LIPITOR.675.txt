Extreme muscle fatigue(suspect Rhabdomyolosis) leading to tendonitis as a result of trying to perform normal physical work related duties.
Just starting to regain strength after 16 months.
Very upset that Doctor prescribed Lipitor after being informed about eye muscle problems with Zocor.
No discussion of diet or possible side-effects, just here take these pills.
