Serious stomach discomfort.
Diarreha, cramps, gas, bloating.
It started about 10 day into my treatment.
Around 4 hours after I took the pill (on a full stomach) the pain and diarreha would start.
I stop treatment and went to an over-the-counter med.
The kneejoin paint stopped but the side effects were awful.
