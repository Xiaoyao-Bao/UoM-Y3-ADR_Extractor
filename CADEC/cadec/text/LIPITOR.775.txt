Muscle and joint pain developed after approx 12 months.
Began to spread to legs, buttocks, elbow.
Stopped taking 10mg / day dosage on march 17th, will hope I start to feel positive results.
Doctor had my on Lipitor and Tricor which seems to increase the chances of side effects.
This is very scary, thought I had some type of bone cancer.
Will never take this drug again.
