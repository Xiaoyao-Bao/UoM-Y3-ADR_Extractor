Leg and toe cramping, leg pain, fasciculations (muscle twitches), muscle atrophy, memory problems, peripheral neuropathy .

I took Lipitor for 2 years and 9 months before I finally made the connection after a myriad of tests showed no other reason for my array of symptoms.
Since then, I have done extensive research on statins and would warn anybody on them to watch out.
Make sure you take supplemental CoQ-10 along with a statin.
If you start to have any muscle problems, quit the drug while you still have a chance.
My life has been changed completely for the worse and I will probably never completely recover from the damage caused by Lipitor.
