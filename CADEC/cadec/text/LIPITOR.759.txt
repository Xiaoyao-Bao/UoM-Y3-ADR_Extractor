As posted previously (search on 269), I have been on a program of 12,000 mg./ day of vitamin C for three months in an effort to lower my cholesterol, and it is having a positive effect.
My cholesterol has dropped from 269 to 240.
I now have increased my intake of Vitamin C to 16,000 mg / day, and we'll see how this works out.
ALL of the negative side effects of Lipitor have disappeared (only took 5 months), and I'm optimistic about the Vitamin C.
Be afraid, be very afraid.
