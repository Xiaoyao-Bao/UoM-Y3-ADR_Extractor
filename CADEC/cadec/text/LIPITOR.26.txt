Extreme fatigue and general weak feeling overall like I have never experienced EVER in my entire life before.
In all honestly, I feel as though my sense of well being has taken a sudden decline after taking this medication for only two weeks.
I intend to phone my M.D.
this morning about discontinuing this medication.
