tingling and aches in hands, chest discomfort, difficulty breathing, stuffy nose, weakness in legs, back pain.
This drug is the worst.
I stopped using it after 17 days when I started experiencing chest pains and difficulty breathing.
Its side effects are horrible and it should be taken off the market.
I do not recommend this drug to anyone.
