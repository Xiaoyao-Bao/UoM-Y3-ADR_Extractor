Body Pains all over, major on going muscle cramps, very bad stomach pains, nervous system problems, pushing blood presure up and up and early signs of osteoarthritis.
Very bad not for my body type.
Came off it to see what happens.
I am trying some other things to control the bad cholesterol - change of diet, exercise and some other natural things.
By stopping Lipitor my quality of life has returned.
My bad cholesterol is fine for now the same as a normal persons reading but not as low as the doctors would like it.
Who would think such a drug can do so much harm and is recommended by the family doctor.
It does lower cholesterol but it also is a major contributor to other health problems.
