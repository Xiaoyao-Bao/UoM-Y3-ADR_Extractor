Stopped because of HIGH CPK.
My Liver blood test are also mildly elevated.
I was in deniel that the statins would cause ME side effects- I have Terrible muscle and joint pain, Burning sensations in neck shoulders and upper chest.
Palpatations .
Insomnia because can not sleep from pain.
I do not want to take pain killers all the time since they have side effects too.
Weight gain -probably not associated.
IOne of the reasons I left my job is because I was so weak all the time and had difficulty walking and driving.
I was a Sales rep for a drug company and many years ago I promoted Zocor.
How IRONIC that I should suffer from statins my self.
My life is miserable.
I feel like dying.
I am sorry I did not keep my weight low so as to avoid my lipids to go so high.
That way I would have never had to suffer like I am now.
The doctors just say and my husband OH your in pain because you are over weight.
The doctors also did not even follow me up properly.
WHo can I sue??????
That is the question.
