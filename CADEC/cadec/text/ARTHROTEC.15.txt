Particularly diahrea!
Many unscheduled washroom stops over the time I've taken this medication.
Lately ankle swelling and lower tendon pain that was not experienced previously.
Males tend to tolerate this medication better than women from my observation.
This medication helped get me back to work and achieve tolerable pain levels and mobility.
I stopped taking it for 4 days and the pain returned.
Currently take one 75mg dose 2 hours before work and seems to be enough to ease my particular condition.
Probably alright for otherwise healthy individuals but those with other medical problems should probably avoid it.
It will most likely exacerbate there ill health with unwelcome side effects.
