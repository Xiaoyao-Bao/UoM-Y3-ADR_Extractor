From one pill : Heavy menstrual bleeding even though my periods ended a week before, cramps, nausea.
Women, beware: do NOT take this medicine unless you've taken it in the past and it was right for you.
Also, do NOT take this if you might be pregnant!
I checked the reviews on this website before taking this drug, and I thought "oh, I'm sure it won't happen to me".
Sure enough, 2 hours after taking a single pill, the bleeding and cramps started.
Never again will I touch this drug.
