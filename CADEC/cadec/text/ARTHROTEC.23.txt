Within half hour of taking this drug I suffered from excessive cramping.
lasted 1/2 hour and continued sporatically over course of several hours.
Became tired,fatigue,shortness of breath from pain, dizzy,nausea, unconsolable.
went hospital, but sat 5 hours never seen by doctor.
drug wore off on its own and went home to rest.
Threw away the remaining pills.
Should be removed from market.
