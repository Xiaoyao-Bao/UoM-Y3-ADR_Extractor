Both entire legs ached several hours a day, diziness, droped down to 20mg every other day with more exercise and dont really have a problem to say, collest.
is 158 now.
Lipitor brought me down about 70 points, but diet was important at the time.
Ive had 5-bypass 1985 and 9-stents 5 years ago
Was on Mevecor and asked to change to lipitor as Mev wasn't doing anything.
I also take some alternatives which have definately made a differance.
I dropped my Lipitor of 20mg down to every other day instead of just laying off of it and this has been pretty much the case so far.
Collestrol has stablized at 147-158 and really not on any diet.
I enjoy eating whatever comes along.
