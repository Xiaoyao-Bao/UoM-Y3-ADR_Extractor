Severe leg pain and weakness, muscle cramps in legs, feet, arms, ribs, face.
I went from being a normal, active 46 year old male doing my job and normal activities of life until taking Lipitor.
I took 20mg. for approximately 1 year, then started noticing the muscle problems so I discontinued it.
That was about a year ago and I am still having severe pain and weakness in my muscles, especially the legs.
I can barely make it up one flight of stairs to get to my office at work.
Have no social activities now, can't even stand to fish anymore.
I regret the day I ever took a statin drug and will warn everyone I talk to about the devastating effects of these drugs.
