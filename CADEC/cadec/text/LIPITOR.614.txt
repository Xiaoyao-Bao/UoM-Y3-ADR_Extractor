After a routine check up my cholesterol level was found to be sky high.
So two months ago the internist put me on Lipitor for high cholesterol.
The lipitor helped in reducing the cholesterol level by 20%.
The side effects were terrible!
I had for a number of years pain in my hipjoints.
The lipitor increased the pain tenfold.
I could hardly walk, sit or drive the car.
The pain I was experiencing especially around the hipjoints was incredible.
I told the specialist about these side-effects and he told me to reduce the dose from 1 a day to 1 every two days!?
I had already stopped taking the lipitor for a week and the pain had decreased somewhat.
I learned from the pharmacist that this drug can cause wasting of muscles and that it was possible to end up in a wheelchair because of it!!
I am going to start on alternative medicines.
I am never going to use this medicine again!.
