Where to begin?
Overall fatigue.
Now get a lot of sinus colds(major pressure pain).
Also used to be able to walk 3 miles easily.
Now cant walk 50 ft without feeling like I am having a heart attack.
Nausea.
I was on Lipitor of a total of 3 weeks before I had my first chest pain walking to car.
Now a month off the drug I still have the pain.
