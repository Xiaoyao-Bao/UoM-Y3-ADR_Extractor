Had muscle pain in my back (primarily small of my back) and down my leg.
I had tried Lipitor before and the result was achy legs.
After some time off of this drug and feeling better, I tried it again.
My back hurt so bad that I went to a chiropractor twice and no relief.
I thought I might have a bulging disc but decided to go off the Lipitor again.
After two months, I'm back to normal.
I call this the drug from hell.
