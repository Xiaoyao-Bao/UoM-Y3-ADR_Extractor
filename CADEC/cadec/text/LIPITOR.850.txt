Joint and Muscle Pain / Stiffness.
I took 20 mg for 9 years and I told numerous physicians about my pain and stiffness and was told that I had arthritis and to keep taking it.
I left it at home by accident when we went on vacation and within 3 days, the pain in my legs began to go away.
After 2 weeks I knew it was a very dangerous medication.
I went to my new physician and he wanted me to try Pravachol.
Afer 4 days on it, I was in a fog and thought I had the flu.
I have been off it for just 36 hours and feel better.
I am an RN and should have known that I was experiencing side effects with Lipitor, but you listen to your Doctor because you trust him.
I now tell my patients to trust what their bodies are telling them.
Statins can't be good for anyone but the drug companies!!!!!!!!!!
They keep lowering the recommended levels so that almost everyone is considered to have high cholesterol.
If someone is 30 and on this for 30 or 40 years there is not telling what the long term effects will be.
And a mi.
