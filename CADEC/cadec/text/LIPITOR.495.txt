This drug is NOT fit for human consumption in my opinion!
I was taking it about 4 months ago and let me tell you, I suffered the worst side effects of the drug.
I had severe muscle spasms and pain all over my body.
My doctor sent me to the e.r. from his office and I got there I was in such excruciating pain they e.r. doc had me on morphine!!!
I am still suffering from the use of the Lipitor.
There is not a day that goes by where I am not in pain.
My muscles in my arms and legs are very weak.
I am 31 years old with 3 kids ages 5, 8 and 11.
I will be disabled for the rest of my life.
I will be taking pain meds the rest of my life.
Please please think twice about using this and other statin drugs.
