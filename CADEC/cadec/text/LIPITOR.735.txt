very very blurry vision, at times felt that I'm going blind, severe muscle pain, dizziness, and migrane headaches.
please call your physician if you feel like me as this is what I did.
had to make another entry as i wanted to change the length of medicine taken from 1 day to 1 month as this was a typo on my part.
