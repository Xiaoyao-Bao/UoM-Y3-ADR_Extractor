The pill eliminated all pain I felt in my hip, but it was hard on my stomach.
On my 10th day of medication, I experienced vaginal bleeding.
This scared me because it was two weeks after my normal period.
There is something really fishy about this drug.
I do not advise anyone to take it as there are many adverse side effects.
