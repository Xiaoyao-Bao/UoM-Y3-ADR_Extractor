I HURT EVERY WHERE.
I FELT LIKE I HAD BEEN RUN OVER BY A TRUCK ALL THE TIME.
I WAS SO WEEK AT TIMES I COULDN'T WALK ACROSS THE ROOM.
I REALLY THOUGH I WAS GOING TO DIE.
MY DR SAYS IT WAS NOT FROM THE LIPITOR.
IT HAS TAKEN MANY MONTHS FOR ME TO FEEL ALMOST NORMAL AGAIN.
I STARTED TAKING B-6 100 MG B-12 1000 MCG AND 800 MCG OF FOLIC ACID EVERYDAY AND IT HAS KEPT MY CHOLESTEROL IN THE NORMAL RANGE.
