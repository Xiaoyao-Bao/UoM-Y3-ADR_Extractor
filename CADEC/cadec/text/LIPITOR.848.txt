I am a Gym Junky, pretty athletic, attend 4 times a week.
took lipitor 40mg and that ended my gym aspirations.
loss of muscle strenth, mainly calves.
Have stopped taking lipitor, changed my diet, and life is slowly getting back to normal.
awful drug.
Maybe the people not affected by Lipitor lead a non physical life or do not have any muscle, and therefor do not notice the effects.????.
Did a great job in lowering colestrol.
down to 2.7 .
