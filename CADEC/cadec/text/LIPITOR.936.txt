Swollen , burning feet and ankles.
The ball of the foot would feel as if it was inflamed.
Constant pins and needles in the ball of the foot and the toes and occasionally would get very painful pins and needles over entire foot.
Had to remove socks and elevate legs to get relief from swelling.
Quit taking Lipitor and within three days swelling stopped, foot and ankle skin flaked off like dermatitis and slowly over the next 4 weeks the symptoms reduced except for an occasional flareup.
Still have minor problems after 4 weeks but it is 80% back to normal.
