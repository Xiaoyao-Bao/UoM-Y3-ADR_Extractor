Can cause a little stomach discomfort so take with food or milk.
This has only happened to me when I've taken it on an empty stomach or accidentally took 2 pills in a 24 hour period.
I have been taking voltaren for approx 8 years to help me battle gout.
It is most effective when taken at first sign of gout symptoms.
My doctor has me get a blood test every six months to make sure my liver and kidneys are ok.
