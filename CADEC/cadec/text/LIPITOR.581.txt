On 10 mg.
didnt seem to have any side effects and my cholestrol went from 256 to 190 in 30 days-I was amazed but then after another month my cholestrol went back up to 235 and my doctor decided to bump up my dose to 20 mg.
thats when the severe muscle pain started and very debillitating-I went to a rheumotogologist thinking it was lupus or fibromalgyia as i felt like I always had the flu and she took a blood test and said I had muscle damage from the Lipitor.
Do the benefits outweigh the severe side effects-Pfizer says it's rare but serious side effects-I know many people that have had the same problem with muscle damage so I would not consider the side effect to be rare and now since I'm off the drug wonder how much permanent damage to my muscles is their due to this awful drug.
