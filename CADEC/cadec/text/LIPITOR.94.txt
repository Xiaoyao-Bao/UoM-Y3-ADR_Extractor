I have done very well with Lipitor for the last 2 1/2 years.
It has reduced my cholesterol significantly-from over 300 to under 150.
Two weeks ago I was given the new generic.
This week I noticed that all my fingers and toes were tingling, a pins and needles feeling.
It was like they had fallen asleep.
I immediately went back to pharmacy and got brand name again (luckily my insurance pays-it will be $15/ 3 month supply more, but it's worth it).
I have noticed just within the last two days the tingling is gone.
Thank goodness!
I read that generics have the same active ingredients, but there may be a difference in how the medicine is released.
It's not EXACTLY the same.
High cholesterol runs in my family and I am greatful that Lipitor can help me manage this.
