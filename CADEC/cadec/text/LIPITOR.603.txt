Lipitor works fine for lowering cholesterol, but the side effects are killers, apparently.
I have been experiencing extreme leg weakness and pain, to the point where I cannot take steps without holding on or going up on my knees--which is agony.
After reading the comments on this page, I am shocked that so many people have experienced the same symptoms (weakness, etc ) after taking Lipitor.
I've been on the drug 7 or 8 years, and have gone off before when leg pain began.
But this time the problems came on more gradually, yet more severely.
They include stiff neck, diarrhea, clumsiness and dizziness.
I'm going off it tonight.
