Lipitor reduced my readings to almost normal.
At the same time I suffered from fibromyalgia.
The pain all over my body got worse as time went on.
I noticed that when I left my Lipitor at home when I was on vacation or other trip, that I began to feel better.
My doctor told me there was a remote possibility that the Lipitor was agravating the fibromyalgia.
I stopped taking Lipitor and feel so much better!
But, it seems I buggered up my stomach from all the pain killers that I took.
What to do next?.
Please be carefull with this drug and watch for all types of body pain,.
