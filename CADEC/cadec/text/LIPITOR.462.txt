DEVELOPED LOWER BACK PAIN.
FOR WEEKS ON END COULD NOT FUNCTION NORMALY.
HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ACTIVE, WORKED OUT REGULARLY.
AFTER 2 MONTHS ON THIS DRUG I FELT AS IF I HAD AGED 20 YEARS.
HAD CONSTANT LOWER BACK PAIN.
THERE WAS NO RELIEF.
DID A SELF EXPERIMENT AND WENT OFF THE MEDICATION FOR A MONTH.
VIOLA!!!
I STARTED FEELING LIKE MY OLD SELF, OR SHOULD I SAY YOUNG SELF.
WILL LOOK FOR AN ALTERNATIVE MEDICATION.
