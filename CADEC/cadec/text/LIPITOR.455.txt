For the past year and half I have been taking Lipitor.
I have been experiencing extreme pain in my should and arm.
It is the same arm which has no lymph nodes and a modified radical mascetomy.
I have had 3 steriod shots to some relief -- but -- short lived.
Finally, dawned on me -- I missed taking Lipitor over the weekend and on Monday the pain was gone.
Started taking it again on Monday.
Pain returned.
Is there a correlation.
I'm stopping the Lipitor.
I was due a MRI next week and possibly surgery on right shoulder with the pain.
