pain in both legs, unable to climb stairs for eight months,unable to stand for any time with out extrem pain in knee joints.
When I notified the prescribing doctor ther was a problem, he eventualy said that there is a problem with the medication and the pain in the legs should subside in eight or nine weeks.
It finaly took fifteen weeks and left me with two failed knee joits that were perfect before taking the medication.
The product should be removed from the market for further evaluation.
