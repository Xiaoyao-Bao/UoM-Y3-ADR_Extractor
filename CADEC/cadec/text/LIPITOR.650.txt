severe pain in left calf.
I was only on lipitor for 2 months but I started getting cramps in my left calf and it started to get worse until it was pain and I had trouble standing for longer periods of time.
Went off the lipitor and within 2 days my calf was better.
Thank God I only took it for 2 months.
Sure, it lowered my cholesterol from 326 to 187 but it is not worth it if you have to live with pain.
