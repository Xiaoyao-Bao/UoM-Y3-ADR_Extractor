severe depression, anxiety, sore joints, sore back, lack of energy.
I recently went off it after I lost some wheight and felt great.
did a 220 ldl reading and Dr put me back on it.
Depression came with a vengence.
I have never gone for therapy, but had no choice.
they suggested a connection with the Lipitor, so I went searching - wow what an eye opening - I am not the only one.
As of now, never again will I take lipitor.
