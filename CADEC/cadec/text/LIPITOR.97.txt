Bouts of extreme forgetfulness, extreme muscle pain, insomnia, tremors, cluster headaches,kidney pain, urinary problems.
Became unable to walk without a cane, unable to sleep, kidney problems (urine like root beer).
I had a high stress detail oriented job that I lost due to inability to think fast enough to manage.
I went from being a SMEE (subject matter expert)to crying in front of my computer unable to function.
Couldn't find words, got lost on way to grocery store etc Dr kept telling me it couldn't be any of the meds I was on.
Finally Googled symptoms and first hit was Spacedoc and there was my answer.
Within 2 days of stopping I had noticeable mental improvement.
I stopped it 8 weeks ago and still have much muscle pain and fatigue.
Kidneys have cleared, but will still give me problems if I fatigue myself.
I think it is a poison, some people do need statans I guess, but not me!.
