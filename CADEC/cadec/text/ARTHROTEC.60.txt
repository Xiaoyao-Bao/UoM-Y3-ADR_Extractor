Took 1 pill with dinner, woke during the night with stomach pain.
In the morning I discovered that I had bled heavily during the night.
Bleeding continued the next day with clotting.
Also developed a rash on my wrist.
Discontinued use after one pill!!.
After checking the web site and seeing the list of side effects for this medication, it is hard to believe that it was ever approved.
I do not recommend this medication for anyone.
I have never had a reaction to any medication before.
The complications of this drug outweight the benefits.
