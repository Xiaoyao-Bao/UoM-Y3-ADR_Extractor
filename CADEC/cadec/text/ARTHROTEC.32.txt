the first pill i took it caused severe abdominal pain but after taking the first one it never did that again , but recently i've been feeling like my stomach is full and empty at the same time hard to explain but thats what it felt like , and also have been getting bruises allover my body due to this drug , other than that my back is back to normal now and i am back at work.
