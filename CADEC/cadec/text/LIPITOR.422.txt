I was ok at first and it did lower my cholesterol but a was feeling tired a lot but didn't make any connection to Lipitor.
after taking Lipitor 20mg for 3 years the side effects for the last few months are: feeling tired all the time, sore weak muscles in left arm and leg, short term memory loss, less patience, loose temper faster, hair loss, comments from friends that I have aged a lot in the last 2 years.
In the last 3 weeks my neck is in a lot of pain and seems a bit swollen.
I went to the doctor 11-26-04 and told him that I quit lipitor 11-20-04 and already feel a LOT BETTER except for the very sore neck.
He said that it is a good idea and that it was doing more harm than good.
I have been browsing the internet a lot in the last week and there are a lot of people that are having problems with Lipitor!
