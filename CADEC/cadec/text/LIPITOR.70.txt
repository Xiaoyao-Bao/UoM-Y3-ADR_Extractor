Muscle weakness,lack of concentration,joint pain,abnormal liver function, ( ? ) unknown skin condition on hands.
I was living with the initial, common side effects, but after 2 years my fingertips got puffy and/or scaly.
In a couple weeks the skin began to come off and the condition spread to the sides of my fingers and my palms.
I DO NOT KNOW if this is lipitor related, but after using 2 prescription ointments with little relief, I quit taking lipitor and after 1 month my hands were healed and I have had no problems since (1 yr.)
None of my doctors can (or are unwilling) to explain this.
They want me back on a statin drug, but I will not untill I have an answer.
