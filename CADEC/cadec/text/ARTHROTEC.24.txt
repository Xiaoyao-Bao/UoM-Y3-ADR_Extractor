I have taken 6 pills in the past (75mg each), but the side effect I had from my last pill was awful.
It induced severe vaginal cramps without bleeding about 2 hours after I took the medication.
I ended up having to take additional medication to get rid of the cramps (pamprin) so that I could sleep.
Sat on the bathroom for 30 minutes.
If I knew I would have went to bed with a sore knee instead - it hurt less than the cramps.
This is the only anti-inflammatory drug that helps for my knee pain/inflammation and its reliable in that.
I take it infrequently, once every several months and 1 pill is often enough for me.
