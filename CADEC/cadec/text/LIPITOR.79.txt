Severe B/L shoulder pain, general weakness, malaise, and slight memory loss.
I started out at 10 mg every day for 7 years, 20 mg for 1 year, 40 then 80 for over 1 1/2 years.
Over the past year, B/L shoulder pain to the point of wearing a sling because it hurt badly when I walked.
I read about the shoulder pain in assorted sites on the web.
Discussed it with my PA and cardiologist.
My PA stopped the Lipitor.
The pain lessened but did not stop.
Went to a Ortho MD who gave me 3 Steroid shots and PT.
It seemed to help but pain would not stop.
Narcs were ordered which helped somewhat but wasn't the answer.
MRI showed a slight linear tear in my Rotator Cuff which he wanted to do surgery.
Decided against surgery.
Both shoulders started to feel better but still couldn't sleep on my left side.
My LDL's were through the roof.
After almost 10 months off Lipitor, my general MD talked me into starting Sinivastatin 40 mg every day.
Well, guess what happened.
My shoulder pain suddenly worsen, especially left side.
I am going to speak with my Cardiologist again and explore alternatives and will be stopping my Statin today!
Moral of the story.
Stay clear of Statin medications.
