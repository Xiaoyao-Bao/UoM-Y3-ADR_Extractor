Dizziness, sickness, stomach gas, feel like a bubble of air is stuck in my chest.
Hadn't realised it was related until I read this but I get the hunger pangs too, I'm assuming this is the acids and gas in your stomach constantly churning over that make you feel like you're hungry.
I've taken co-codamol for my fibromyalgia for many years which I have very few side effects with.
I've recently had this severe hip pain on both sides which the co codamol wasn't touching so I went back to the Dr He recommended this anti-inflamatory and as he said next stop would be cortozone injections I was willing to give it a try.
I've tried it for a week but it makes me feel dreadful.
Every time I stand up I have to hold onto something for fear of falling over, I feel sick and light headed and I get those waves of nausea where you suddenly feel all clammy.
It's very much like having a permanent hangover, even down to the hunger which until I read thsi site I hadn't connected to the rest of it.
I've felt no discernible difference in the pain in my hips and the side effects simply aren't worth it so thats it for me and this drug.
