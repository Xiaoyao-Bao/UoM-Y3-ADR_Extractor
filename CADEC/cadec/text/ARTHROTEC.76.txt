swelling, bloating, increased appetite, empty stomach feeling,dry,itchy skin.
Arthrotec works wonders, but side effects worry me.
Am trying to wean off it with glucoasamine/chondroitin and MSM, which are supposed to be good for arthritis, bone enhancement/elasticity etc
Taking all at same time now,pain is too great!
Was on IB 1600 a day and 2 tylenol 8's a day.
not enough.
