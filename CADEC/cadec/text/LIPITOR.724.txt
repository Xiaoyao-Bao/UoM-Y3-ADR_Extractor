Took Liptor for 3 months 2 years ago.
Developed severe thigh muscle pain (both legs involved) and could not walk 75 feet.
Took myself off Liptor and all symtoms went completely away.
Then my doctor had a bright idea to try Liptor again and the same symtoms came back.
Problem is, went off this drug and I still have muscle problem and at times can hardly walk!
Now the top outer thigh muscle starts to feel very warm, then get numb and lastly it starts to feel very cool (Like the icy hot patch).
This drug is so bad, I just want to get back to my normal self, but I feel that the damage has been done!
Am making Dr appointment to see if anything can be done.
2-3 month.
