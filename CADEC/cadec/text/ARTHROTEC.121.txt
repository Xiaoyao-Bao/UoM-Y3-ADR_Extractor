dizzines dioreah stomach cramps disorientation.
followed by ulceration of the osophragus,and stomach, and possibly the gut.
Prone to infections especially of the blader.
have been taken off the drug, stayed on it too long because it allowed me to work.
Talked myself out of the side effects, until they frightened me.
Now I dont know how I am going to get back to work, it has left me feeling exausted, and depressed.
