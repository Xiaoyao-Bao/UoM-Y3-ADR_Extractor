Jaw,neck, low back and hip pains.
Numbness/tingling in legs and arms.
Dr changed first to Vytorin then Pravachol.
Took about a month for the same symptoms to begin with Vytorin.
The pravachol started the pains again in about 3 months.
I stopped taking all statin drungs.
Still hurting after 2 months of stopping.
Be careful taking this drug.
