My God,this stuff is great!
Used on my extremely painful shoulder and within minutes felt relief.
(I thought it might be the Advil I had taken earlier kicking in)
However, several days later,had a flare with joint pain in wrist.
Squeezed out a few drops and rubbed it in and pain relief was almost immediate.
I read that this is prescribed for knee pain but my doctor gave me a sample because the voltaren has worked ok for me and I can't take Advil a lot because of the gastro effects.
Boy,I love this stuff and will ask for a script next time I see the Rheumy.
