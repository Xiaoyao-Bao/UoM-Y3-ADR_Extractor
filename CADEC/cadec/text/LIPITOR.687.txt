My dad has been on Lipitor for over a year, they increased his dose by doubling it.
Within a month he started to experience lower leg weakness, cramping of the calf muscles after walking only a block and while resting.
He read an article about Baycor, Lipitor, etc
We asked his M.D. about this & he told us that the side effects of Lipitor were an INFLAMMATORY muscle weakness & degeneration.
With my coaxing & the Dr's okay my day stopped Lipitor for one month.
His legs did not get better OR worse.
The Dr's have him so worried about his cholesterol that he started taking it again.
He is now so debilitated, he was using a walker, & his wheelchair is being delivered today.
We have been to a Neurologist, Vascular Surgeon, and blood Dr
He can no longer drive.
He has reduced feeling below the knees, he has fallen 4 times.
He is losing the feeling in his right hand and the inability to perform fine motor skills.
With all the tests he has had to rule out other causes, it seems that Lipitor is the culprit.
Until the dose was doubled my dad was active, able to walk, drive, and enjoy life.
If Lipitor is the cause of all these problems, high cholesterol does not look so bad.
I would never take or recommend this drug to anyone.
It has destroyed my father's life.
