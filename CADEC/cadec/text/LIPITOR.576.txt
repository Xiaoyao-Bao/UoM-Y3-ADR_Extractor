hair fell out, insomnia, areas of fat under the skin became sore to the touch, last straw was ringing in the ears.
I took 10mg of Lipitor daily for about 5 months.
It did a fantastic job of lowering my cholesterol, and improving the good/bad ratio.
Eventually, the insomnia, and the ringing in the ears (tinnitus) caused me to stop it.
After 2 months on nothing I tried 5mg of Crestor (one dose), and had to lie in bed with a heating pad on my legs for the aching it caused (like the flu).
I know many people who tolerate statin drugs without a problem, but for me, it's just not worth the side effects.
I won't try again.
