Stated with joint and pain and muscle weakness, depression, fatigue and cramps.
At each annual visit to the Dr I would tell him my symptoms and mention I thought it was the Lipitor, He waould always say no way and I need to continue the statin drug.
My symptoms gradualy got worse over the next 5-6 years, currently I have muscle twitching in both arms, loss of muscle mass in arms, hands and face with slurred speech.
Took myself off the lipitor a year ago.
Joint pain is completly gone.
Was told my Dr I may have ALS.
Saw an ALS Specialist Feb, 2002, she said she could not diagnosis ALS at this time as you have to have 3 extermities effected and I have 1 1/2.
She said she has seen over 100 patients with symptoms the same as mine that had been on statin drugs.
I can't begin to tell you what a scary year this has been.
But am holding out hope I will improve in time.
Have read that some people it taks 1-2 years to improve at all.
I trusted my Doctor!!!!!!!!
Now I trust that what I was felling 6 years ago was not all in my head.
Anyone with simular symptoms or coments please e-mail.
