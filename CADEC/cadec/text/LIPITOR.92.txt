Muscle aches and weakness in neck, arms, shoulders, upper back, legs.
Severe pain in left foot and third and fourth toes.
Pain and weakness increased until I needed help dressing and combing my hair.
I could not do daily activities such as pick up a cup of coffee or put on a seatbelt without significant pain.
The ball of my left foot was so painful I could not put pressure on it when walking so I walked on the side of my foot.
Symptoms began 12 weeks after starting Lipitor.
I reported to my cardiologist and internist who both denied problems were related to Lipitor because my CPK was only mildly elevated (250).
I also saw a podiatrist, chiropractor, and spine specialist with no relief.
When it got so bad I could not take it anymore and did not care about my cholesterol I took myself off of Lipitor and got a 50% improvement after one week.
I then saw a neurologist who diagnosed me with statin induced myalgia.
He said he sees a lot of patients with slightly elevated CPK that many physicians do not recognized as a symptom of a statin intolerance.
I have been off of Lipitor for two years and continue to improve very slowly, but I still suffer from some pain and weakness.
I can now walk normal, but my toes are still quite painful at times.
