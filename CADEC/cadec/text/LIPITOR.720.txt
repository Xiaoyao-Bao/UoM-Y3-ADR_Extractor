Very blurred vision and lower back pain.
I had a sudden loss of vision and attributed it to getting older.
After reading literature on another medication a light bulb went off and I realized the blurry vision was probably due to the drug Lipitor and am stopping the drop today.
My vision is so blurry it feels like I need glasses.
