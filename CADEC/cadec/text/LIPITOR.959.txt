neck pain/back spasms/foggy thinking/insomnia.
I took this drug for 1.5 years.
Great results.
but the side effects were very negative as listed above.
My dr. reviewed my complaints and agreed that it wasn't worth it.
I am going to do a diet and excercise change.
60 days blood check and then look at natural options/red rice/increase omega 3/ect.
No more statins for me.
I don't have plaque so I have options.
My husband has a high plaque count so he doesn't.
