Cramping aching muscles in legs and back.
Flu-like symptoms and fatigue.
Foggy, out-of-touch feelings and unable to concentrate.
I started out with zocor, but developed these adverse symptoms after 3 months.
I stopped taking it and they went away.
The doctor switched me to lipitor and the symptoms came right back.
I will never take another statin type drug under any circumstances.
