abdominal pain, constant soreness in abdomen, headache, general stomach upset feeling that won't go away before or after eating.

I was taking Celebrex until ineffective, then Vioxx, then Lodine, and now Arthrotec.
I realize that a knee replacement is inevitable, and I need the medication, but the stomach pains are aggravating although bearable.
