I have been taking 10mg of Lipitor for 3 months.
After 1 month I had severe diarrhoea which cleared after 1 week , so I paid no attention to it.
Excessive gas another sympton which persists.
For the past 2 weeks I have had back ache (which I have experienced before) but this time not cured by chiropractic treatment.
I was puzzled!!
Recently after walking for a while I experienced severe pain in my right leg from thigh to knee and then to ankle which caused me to limp.
I found this website and I seem to have similar symtoms as others who take this medication.
I see my GP tomorrow for the results of my first 3 month blood test.
I shall come off the medication today.
Thank you.
