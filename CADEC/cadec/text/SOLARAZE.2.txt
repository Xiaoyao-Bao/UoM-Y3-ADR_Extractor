I can hardly believe that a topically applied gel is causing this stuff, but it gets better when I quit using it and returns when I do use it.
hard to breathe, lungs feel heavy, general feeling of sadness, tiredness, wanting to quit everything and give up (SOOOOOO not my personality).
I was blaming my antibiotic for these side effects, but now I see that they come and go with the use of the solaraze.
Scary.
LEt me be the first to say that I have extremely porous skin, so I am probably absorbing a higher dose than was thought likely, I have eczema and take other meds that exfoliate my skin, so probably a whopping dose is going in.
I have found that I can use a q-tip and just put it on a few spots and then do not get the global bad effect, so I may do it this way and just treat one arm at a time, then one leg.
