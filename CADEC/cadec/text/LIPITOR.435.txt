fuzzy vision, bad because I only have vision in one eye.
A month after quiting, it has NOT gone away.
migraine almost daily, tintinitus,.
Since I found later that vision problems were listed as a side effect, I have great concern that my doctor, who was aware of my vision problems, prescribed this drug.
