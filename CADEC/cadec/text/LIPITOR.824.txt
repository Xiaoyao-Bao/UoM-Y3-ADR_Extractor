I have been complaining to a variety of doctors about severe muscle cramping that has been affecting me for the past three years, which started upon waking one morning with what felt like a shark biting into my right calf.
I'd been taking Zocor for years and had recently been switched to Lipitor.
Not one of the doctors once mentioned the statin as a possible cause of this problem.
I wake up each morning feeling paralyzed all over my body.
as if I have rigor mortis and am being resurrected from death (no exaggeration).
Thanks for this website and to all you people who have shared your experiences of Lipitor.
I finally have my answer!!! .
This drug has been destroying every aspect of my life.
physical and psychological.
It's destroyed my self-confidence, my sex life, my business.
And now it looks and feels like the medical establishment is keeping it all a dirty little secret for the sake of the income that statins generate.
I'd rather have died outright from a heart attack than suffer as I have the past three years.
And, reading this website, I can find a little comfort in knowing that I am not alone with this maddening array of weird symptoms.
Thank you!
Thank you!!!
You may have saved my life !!!.
