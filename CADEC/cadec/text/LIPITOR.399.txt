Took for 30 days.
Was aware of side effects, but DOC assured me they were minimal.
I started getting some pain in ankles from time to time, I work out so attributed the pain to "old age" (45).
I was in Baltimore on business when one night I started experiencing severe pain in one ankle - I could not sleep.
I was a bit better the next day, but limped around a bit.
A week later the pain came back, my ankle hurt so much I could hardly make to work.
I could not walk up the stairs in my house without extreme pain.
I felt horrible & made an appointment with DOC.
Thought it might be gout, but found this website.
I quit taking the crap before my appointment with DOC.
The nurse told me "we have a lot of people who complain about pain".
DOC understood and has kept me off Statins.
I wish those who take this stuff successfully the best, but for those of us who have adverse effects this can be deviating.
It took me 3-4 weeks to fully recover.
MD's need to take their patients reports about Lipitor seriously.
I would rater drink gasoline than take this stuff again! .
I have to wonder if the effects of this Med are being downplayed by the powers that be.
