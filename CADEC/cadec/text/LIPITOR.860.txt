none.
but soon as i started it the staticy feeling in my abdomin stopped and the hot feelings i usually suffered from when that static would start had ceased with it.
i feel much better.
it drove my cholesterol down to almost perfect levels.
of course if you behave with your diet.
AND if the medication doesn't make you sick.
if you feel better taking it you've hit the jack pot.
i've heard so many who suffer bad cramps and chest pains with this medication.
i've lucked out.
though i've had unsuccessful endeavors with another medication pertaining to triglycerides.
but lipitor has actually made me feel much better from a problem i've suffered feeling as a child.
abdominal irritation or a sensation that feels like electricity zapping around my midsection and used to make me feel hot and irritable.
soon as i took lipitor that all stopped.
i'm very happy something helped that.
i was tired of feeling strange when it came to my gut.
:D.
