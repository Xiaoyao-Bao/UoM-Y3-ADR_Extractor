Had a scary experience that I am associating with Voltaren.
Not completely convinced it was the RX but I have no other reason for the reaction.
First dosage I was hit with extreme abdominal issues including diarrhea.
Figured it was a lack of adequate food on board when I took the 1st dose so increased my meal before I took the 2nd dose.
Problem solved!
Was on the meds for 7 days when I experienced chest discomfort and upper abdominal pressure.
With a medical background, I know that cardiac symptoms are mistaken for gastric reasons so I went to the ER.
Long story short, I was diagnosed with severe gastric distress (GERD) and with a "gastric cocktail" and a high octane prilosec, I had some serious relief and sent home.
Not convinced it was the issue, I went a day without the RX and then started again.
I wasn't entirely 100% after taking the dose and now, I am fairly certain it was the Voltaren.
I must say that my symptoms did improve within 3 days but the ER visit was.
