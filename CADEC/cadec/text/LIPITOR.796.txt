Hair loss (Diffuse Alopecia), hair thinning.
I have had type 1 diabetes for 21 years.
My blood sugar control has always been good (Hemoglobin A1C tests always below 6%).
I have a healthy diet and a normal weight.
My Thyroid function is normal.
I have been taking, Olmetec(olmesartan), Istin(amlodipine) and Lipitor(atorvastatin).
Since taking Lipitor my hair has started falling out at an alarming rate.
The thinning is most pronounced at the back and sides of my head so it's not conventional male pattern baldness.
Lipitor has certainly lowered by cholesterol but I've stopped taking it after 9 months.
The stress caused by losing my hair in this way will probably do me more harm than having high cholesterol.
