I've been taking Liptor for about a year with no major side effects, but recently I have been experiencing a sore, tingly tongue(Glossitis) and have ruled out everything from toothpaste to spicy foods.
I have also had dizzy spells, headaches, and trouble sleeping.
Doctor told me to discontinue Lipitor which I just did a couple days ago and I should know in a month or so if this is the cause (glossitis and other symptoms are listed as possible side effects, although in my case it's been a delayed reaction)
Lipitor did bring my cholesterol down from 268 to 153 but I want the glossitis,headaches and dizziness to go away.
I hate feeling this way.
I will find another way to control my cholesterol if Lipitor proves to be the culprit.
