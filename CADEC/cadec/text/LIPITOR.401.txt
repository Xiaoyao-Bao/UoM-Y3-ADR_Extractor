Weak legs, lack of concentration, slurred speach, loss of balance and loss of short term memory.
I spent 2 days in the hospital because I could'nt talk without slurring my words, I could'nt concentrate and could'nt walk more than a few minutes without feeling weak.
I have been off Lipitor for 2 months now and still get sore and weak legs and can barely remember anything that has happened recently :(.
If you are over 50 it is better to have high cholesterol than too low!!
