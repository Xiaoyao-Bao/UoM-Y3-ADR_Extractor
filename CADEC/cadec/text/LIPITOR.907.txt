Severe lower back pain and an aching pain across my shoulders.
Generally I also felt weak.
The symptoms first started after about 4 months of taking this drug and tapered down for a couple of weeks after stopping.
I tried 3 different statins, all with the same horrid side effects.
I will NEVER take another statin drug.
