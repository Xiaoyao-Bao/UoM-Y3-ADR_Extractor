I cannot believe the immediate difference this medication had made in my life.
I could not get up from my desk without holding onto the desk and walking up the stairs was intolerable.
Within one day I felt the pain lessen.
I am now walking up the stairs 95 % normal and can actually walk through a mall without having to sit down every 5 minutes.
i am in need of a knee replacement, but in meantime feel like I have my life back.
