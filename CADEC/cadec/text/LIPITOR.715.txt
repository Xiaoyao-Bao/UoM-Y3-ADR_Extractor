I have been on Lipitor for approximately two and a half years.
Recently I experienced losing muscular, headache, neck pain and stiffness, fatigue, memory loss, muscles pain on the left side of my chest, depression, sleepless nites and balance loss.
It work great on reducing cholesteral level, but its side effects became another problem for me.
I will discuss it with my doctor in my next visit.
