I was prescribed this drug because I had spent a whole night in complete agony; abdominal pain, lower back pain, all that I imagine labor pain to be, except I was not in labor.
Though the cause of my pain remains undetermined, the Arthrotec combined with Paracetamol pretty much eliminated the pain.
This was a big relief, as the 1200 MG of Ibuprofen I had taken throughout the night had done nothing.
I only took 1 Arthrotec and 1 Paracetamol and that did the trick.
HOWEVER: I had a very bad headache yesterday and Ibuprofen again didn't work.
I still had the other Arthrotec pills left, so I took one.
Although it alleviated the pain, I got up this morning with heavy vaginal bleeding even though my period ended last week.
I was relieved to read that this could be a side effect, as it means I probably don't have something serious, but I will have to be in some serious pain to risk bleeding from the vagina again.
Next time I'll try my luck with Paracetamol.
The pill I took consisted of 50 MG Diclofenac and 200 MG Misoprostol.
