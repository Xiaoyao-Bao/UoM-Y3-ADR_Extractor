Lipitor is the only prescription drug I take and have taken it for four years now.
I have noticed I am gaining excess weight even though I am not eating more.
My stomach is bloated, with excess gas (although could be the weight gain?).
I also am experiencing increased memory loss, and fatigue, but then I rarely sleep well (due to night sweats) since I went through menopause ten years ago.
I think some of my symptoms are related to being post menopausal rather than from the Lipitor.
