took Lipitor for over a year with no negative effects, then gradually developed terrible joint pain, couldn't move shoulders, hips hurt, had to push out of chair like old person.
stopped taking it after almost 2 years; it really lowered cholesterol, but at cost of terrible joint pain, loss of sleep, shoulder and hip pain and loss of range of motion.
Stopped, and pains lessened in one week; took months for it all to go away.
