I went from a vigorous woman who two years ago spent two weeks walking all over London and Paris, whose favorite hobby was hiking, etc , to a fragile, crippled crone who, for a while, was certain I belonged in a wheel chair, due to the effects of this horrible, killer medication after having hip replacement surgery.
Every muscle from my waist down was effected, my legs became LEAD, my bladder all but quit working; blood began showing up in my urine, I had every test in the book, went to doctor after doctor, and no one recognized this medication as the problem, until I finally went to a neurologist for my back problems.
I could not walk ten steps without the most excruciating pain and fatigue, all I ever wanted to do was to sleep or at least lay down.
I lost all interest in everything, had no energy for anything but the most basics.
I quit taking Lipitor, ON MY OWN, in August of 2001.
I experienced a certain amount of immediate relief, and my bladder began working normally again, but still have horrible after-effects, and I don't know if they will ever go away.
I feel the muscles in my legs will never regain their previous strength, I have constant back pain, I cannot walk a half a block without extreme muscle fatigue and pain in my thighs, calves and buttocks, and I still am experiencing malaise that was never present before.
I consider myself lucky to be alive!!.
The more I hear, the more I think people need to be made aware of the dangerous side effects, particularly the effects surgery has on anyone taking Lipitor.
This is one of the most dangerous medications on the market!.
