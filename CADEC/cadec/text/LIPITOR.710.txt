Horrible leg pain.
turned into an cripple,can't get out of bed in the morning, have hip pain.
never had a problem with my hips in my life!.
all my blood,liver function are normal!!.
can't be!.
Can't walk up stairs, bend over.
or walk around the store.
I use to walk twice a day for forty minutes, now I can hardly walk to my car.
have tried everything for leg pain, and my new hip pain.
I live on motrin.
and asper-cream.
I am going to stop taking Lipitor TODAY.
a heart attack seems easier.
Glad I found this site.
