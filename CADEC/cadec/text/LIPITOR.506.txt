I am writing this for my husband--memory loss, tremors in right hand, symptoms of parkinson's disease.
since lipitor causes a decrease in coenzyme q10 and now there is a study in the archives of neurology showing that using large doses of coenzyme q10 slows the progression of parkinson's disease, i wonder how many others have experienced a diagnosis of parkinson's having been on lipitor?
we began questioning the role of lipitor in Parkinson's when my niece's husband who is 57 was experiencing the same symptoms as my husband(the 57 yr old was diagnosed with Parkinson's 2 weeks ago) and the major factor in common between the 2 of them--Lipitor for 4+ yrs.
not worth the risks of taking the drug.
will now control cholesterol with diet and exercise.
