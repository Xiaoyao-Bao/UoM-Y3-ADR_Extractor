I was prescribed Zipsor for bone and joint pain associated with Lupus.
I also have 3 herniated discs that have been bothering me for years, and for which I have always taken a low dose of Vicodin (almost daily).
The Zipsor works well on the Lupus pain, but also almost completely wiped out the pain from the herniated discs, and has replaced my usual narcotic pain relief for my back.
As with any disc issues there seems to be the occasional flare up, but when they do occur now they are minor, and once I take my usual dose of Zipsor, the pain is gone again.
I have had no recognizable side effects.
