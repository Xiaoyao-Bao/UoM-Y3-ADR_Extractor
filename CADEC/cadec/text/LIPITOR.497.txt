I took Lipitor for about a year.
I had vague muscle aches and almost overnight developed low back pain where I had to roll out of bed in order to stand up without pain.
I told my doctor I took myself off the drug.
I know my own body after 65 yrs and I NEVER had muscle pain before.
What else could I attribute this pain to?
Why is there such denial as to the damage this drug can do.
I admit cholesterol went down but so did my muscles and stamina.
I feel somewhat better and it is two months that I am off the drug.
Do Research before taking.
