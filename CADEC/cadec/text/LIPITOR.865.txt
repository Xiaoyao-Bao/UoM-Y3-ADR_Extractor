After taking 40 mg/day of Lipitor for a couple of years, I started to notice foot pain, diagnosed as a neuroma in the right foot, then a hammer toe, then left heel pain.
I didn't connect this with Lipitor and continued to take it.
I saw a podiatrist who made no mention of the connection between foot pain and statins.
One day a pharmacist told my husband that there was a huge connection between taking statins and foot pain.
I dc'd Lipitor 6 mos. ago, and my foot pain improved a lot, but I still have some daily pain and discomfort when I walk.
My cholesterol numbers have shot up, but I won't take statins again.
I'm afraid I'll become a cripple.
I'll pay more attn. to diet & exercise, try Vit. C and prescription Niacin.
If you have foot pain while on a statin, assume a connection, and assume that family physicians and podiatrists are largely unaware of this connection.
