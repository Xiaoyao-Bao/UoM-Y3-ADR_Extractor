Aches and pain from head to toe, very grouchy.
I have been competitive in road racing for almost 20 years, but after starting this drug I began to notice my performance falling off.
Later I got pains so bad that I could not run.
I stopped taking this drug and after about 3 months am almost back where I was with my running.
I detest lawyers, but statin class drugs are crying out for a class action lawsuit to stop their use.
