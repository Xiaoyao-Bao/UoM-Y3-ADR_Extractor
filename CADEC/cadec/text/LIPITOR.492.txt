The very first day I took 20 mg of lipitor I experienced a severe headache and neck pain.
I felt light headed and shaky.
By the fifth day I felt flu-like and very sick.
The headache was constant and only Aleve slightly helped it.
I would sit with a heating pad for hours on my neck.
On day 6 I called my doctor and he told me to stop taking lipitor.
This is my 3rd day off the drug and I feel 90% better.
I only had a slight headache and shouldar ache today.
There are sooo many people that take liptior and never have a side effect and they achieve wonderful results.
I will never take it again.
Now I don't know what to do about lowering my cholesterol.
I really do not want to take another drug.
I know my doctor will laugh at natural remedies and I do not know how to do it, but I will try.
