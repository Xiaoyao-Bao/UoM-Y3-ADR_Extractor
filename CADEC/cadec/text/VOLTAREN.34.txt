It only took three pills only one a day to realize that the side effects can be quite dangerous.
On the first night my heart was thumping pretty hard all night and weird chest pains.
On second night same thing plus pain in my kidney area as well as stomach.
The third night was all of the night before plus nausea and skin irritation.
The side effects quit after 4rth night.
Volteren did nothing to help my arm.
Even with a full stomach, this pill can be very hard to handle.
Side effects can easily bring you closer to the grave.
