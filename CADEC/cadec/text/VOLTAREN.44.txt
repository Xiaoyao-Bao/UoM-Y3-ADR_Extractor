I was taking 75mg only once every three or four days.
At first it was miraculous, no pain.
I felt fabulous, except I did notice mild headache.
Then the side effects kicked in.
Now , if I take only one pill, I have abdominal cramps, followed by diarrhea, lots of it!
Also, LOTS of gas, gurgling, mild cramping all day.
I tried one more today, immediately got a bad headache, and cramping, nausea, and heartburn.
That does it.
I'm going back to iubrofen!.
I took this the first time in February 2008, and have taken it occasionally since.
Basically it works great for my pain, but I can't live with the side effects.
