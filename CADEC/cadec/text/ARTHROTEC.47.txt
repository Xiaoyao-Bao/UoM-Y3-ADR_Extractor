after taking just one dose, had hunger feeling and stomach cramping, in the eve and through the night constant muscle cramps in my calf muscles, couldn't sleep, had to keep jumping out of bed because of the cramps.
I just went for test and haven't gotten results yet, but Dr feels I have more than 1 form of arthritis, I also have a very sensitive stomach, this is cheaper and more approved by health insurance, so that is why this prescribed.
Seems to me we always have to choose lesser of the 2 evils, I can't deal with Charlie Horses, so I am stopping this med.
