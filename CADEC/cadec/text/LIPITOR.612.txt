Pain along front and outer side of shins.
very tender to the touch.
walking was the worst,some weird toe tingling at times.
lasted for years, told it was a pinched nerve in my back.
After reading reports on the internet I stopped it a month ago and its about 50% better already.
muscle pain side effects seem much more common than realized by doctors or admitted by the company.
