aches and pain in both arms and shoulders and weakness in arms, especially left arm.
Difficulty sleeping because of pain.
Noticed a decrease in sexual desire, but don't know if Lipitor is to blame.
Seems like the cure is worse than the disease.
I will discontinue using lipitor and see if the pain goes away.
