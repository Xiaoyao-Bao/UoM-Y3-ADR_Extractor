For the first 8 days of ever taking it, the only side effect was a similar feeling you get when you have an empty stomach and light nausea that lasted for no more that 30 minutes
After 8 days, the feeling elevated to an annoying sharp pain in my stomach.
Then two days later, I had to stop using it because the pain was becoming unbearable.
Now I have been off for two days and I still have the stomach pain.
Aside from the stomach pain, it worked miracle on my nighttime spinal pain.
Now I have to see my doctor again to see if I should keep taking it.
I tried Naprosyn just before and had to stop taking it for the same reasons.
