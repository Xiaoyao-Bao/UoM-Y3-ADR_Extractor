Kidney failure, difficulty swallowing, persistent pain in calf and knee, short term memory loss, peripheral neuropathy, constipation, sleep disturbance, mood change, rage.
I took 80mg of Lipitor for 8 years.
My symptoms got so bad that I had to stop working.
Recently I was diagnosed with kidney failure and also put on zetia.
I immediately started to feel even worse, but took the drug for a year until my symptoms got to be unbearable.
My doctor dismissed the leg pain and said that kidney failure was unrelated.
Do not take statins!
They will rob you of your mind and ruin your health.
The medical community will try to convince you that you'll live longer and avoid heart attacks by taking this.
Read the facts.
I stopped all statins and am starting to see improvement in swallowing.
Leg pain is gone.
My memory is getting better.
I'll never recover from the kidney failure, will need dialysis or transplant.
Will explore alternative natural remedies.
