Massive hair loss, extreme joint stiffness (esp in my right knee - it would just lock-up), heart palpitations, heavy depression, skin and eyes swollen and itching.
I have taken it for a long time and only in the last year have these symptoms occurred - perhaps these are long-term usage effects.
I don't know why this drug is even being allowed to be sold!.
