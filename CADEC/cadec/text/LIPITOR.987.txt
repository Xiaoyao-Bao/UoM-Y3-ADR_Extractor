Initially there were no side effects.
It took the better part of two years for them to start appearing.
During that time, my numbers were doing great!
But then, very gradually, things began to change.
Fatigue was the first symptom for me.
It hit hard!
I was retireing at 9PM when it used to be 11:30.
Then the muscle and joint pain kicked in.
I felt much older than I was.
My family noticed the short term memory loss before I did.
It was very embarrasing for me.
The blisterey rash on my arms and legs had me concerned even more.
What was wrong with me?
Is this what old age(62) should normally bring?
When my vision became blurry, I started my search.
That was in June of 2007.
By August 07, I was off Lipitor for good.
My cardiologist tried various substitutes without luck until we got to Simivastatin which seemed to work without the side effects.
