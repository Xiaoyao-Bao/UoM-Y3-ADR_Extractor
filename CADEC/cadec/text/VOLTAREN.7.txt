Possibly diarrhea and stomach pain, but most likely none because I am taking this with a nasty antibiotic for a sinus infection that definitely causes diarrhea and nausea.
I was supposed to take it 2x/day for 7 days and then 2x/day as needed.
I completed the 7 days and then did not take it on the 8th day.
The pain was immediately worse than before taking Voltaren.
It does help the pain in my knee, which is a strained meniscus, but I'm afraid that the drug is masking the pain which enables me to overexert my joints and cause more injury.
This really makes me nervous.
I am going to speak with my doctor about this possibility.
