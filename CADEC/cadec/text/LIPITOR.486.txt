I have had muscle/joint pain, mainly in my arms which is very painful when I position them in certain ways; otherwise I am just.
This works for lowering Cholesterol, but not so sure about the big picture.
I hesitated going on it and now believe my original impression was probably correct.
I am going to try something natural instead.
The pain isn't worth it.
