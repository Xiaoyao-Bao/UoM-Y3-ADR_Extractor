severe acid reflux after taking for 15 days.
I am back on it now for 1 month after making adjustment to my diet.
Helps very much.
I would get about a 30 sec.
headache but no longer.
AS I have had a history of running to the toilet I dont do that any longer.
Happy response.
Since I cant take most of the other meds.
I was hoping this one would do the job.
It is helping more than I could have wished for.
If you email me, make sure you put the subject in or I wont answer.
