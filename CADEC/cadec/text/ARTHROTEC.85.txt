Horrible stuff.
how did this ever pass scrutiny of the powers that be.
Crazy side effects.
Dizziness while rolling over while sleeping and faintness and disorientation upon sitting up in the morning.
Major stomach pain, massive gas cramps and bloating.
Could not stop going to the bathroom with the runs.
Thought I was having a heart attack or stroke coming on.
Only took it for 5 days with only one a day in the morning with food.
Could not figure out why I was so sick.
Thanks to this site.
Stopping it pronto!
Needs to be banned.
Warnings should be discussed with pharmacist face to face when this is prescribed and before taking it.
Should be scrutinized from the first pill.
