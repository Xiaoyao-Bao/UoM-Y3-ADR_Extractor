Constant heel pain, Possible cause of ulcerative colitis, but have no proof of this, and gastro/ent.
Dr states Lipitor not likely cause, I believe otherwise.
was on 10mg for 6 months,increased to 40mg for 6 months,reduced back to 10mg (because high CPK level)for rest of time taking med.
Did not associate foot pain or colitis with statin until reading of others with similar problems.
WILL NOT TAKE LIPITOR (OR ANY OTHER STATIN) ANYMORE!!.
