This drug enables me to be much more physically active with less dependence on pain relievers.
I can bike at fairly high levels of intensity for as much as 25 miles.
I haven't tried longer but I'm sure I could and getting to that level was a great accomplishment.
I have had 6 knee surgeries including 2 partial replacements.
Use it before exercise.
Reapply after shower and before bed.
Highly recommended!
It has not eliminated the need for oral pain meds in all situatations but has helped.
