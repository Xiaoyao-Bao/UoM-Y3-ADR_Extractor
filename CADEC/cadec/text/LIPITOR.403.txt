I have been on this medication for approximately two years and it has been very affective in lowering my cholesterol; however, I did notice that I became depressed with intermittent muscle pain.
I recently mentioned this to my physician and asked if he knew if this particular medication causes these symptoms as all my blood studies for liver function, etc have been normal.
I decided to stop the Lipitor and within a few days I felt so much better.
I will call him tomorrow and ask if I can be switched to another medication.
It is a very effective medication, but obviously has its problems as indicated by those patients who had very similar effects.
