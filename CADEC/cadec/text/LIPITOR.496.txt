Constant aching/pain and weakness in arms, wrists, back of hands and shoulders.
Pain in lower legs and lower back not quite as severe but still present.
Gas and frequent diarrhea.
Difficulty getting to sleep due to aching muscles.
'Severe aggitation' and quick to snap.
For a while I was almost looking for someone to push a little too far so I could punch them.
I usually avoid confrontations.
The aggitation is one of my biggest concerns.
Also growing more and more tired.
I cut the dose from 10mg to 5mg and reduced above side effects by about 40%.
Surprised when I found others had similar symptoms.
Took 10mg of Lipitor for 6 weeks and dropped my cholesterol from 310 down to 225.
Mentioned how I felt and was directed to cut the dose in half.
Have taken 5 mg for about 4 weeks and cholesterol is now around 210.
