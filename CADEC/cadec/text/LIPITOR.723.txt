depression, muscle pain in shoulders, hips and feet.
My feet felt like I was walking on small ice cubes when barefoot.
Big time flatulence, achilles tendon tightness, dizziness, (one fall).
PCP started me on 40 mg 6 weeks ago, quit 3 days ago, feeling better.
Muscle pain improved, depression almost gone, fatigue persists.
