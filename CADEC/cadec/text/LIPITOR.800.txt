Fuzzy, dizzy, light-headedness feeling I've never had before.
Low grade headache goes with it.
Mild insomnia.
Poor concentration, noise intolerance.
I rarely get headaches.
Started getting them a while back, never put 2 and 2 together.
Saw an internist and 2 neurolgists, had MRI, MRA, all showing nothing.
Stopped Lipitor 2 weeks ago, with 40% reduction in severity but still waiting for it to go away.
Not many here have posted follow-up.
Because so many people take Lipitor, and headaches, etc are so coommon, what we need is to show that there is an increased incidence of side effects like these compared to those not taking Lipitor, AND that the side effects go away once stopping it.
I will re-post when either 3 months goes by or the side effects disappear, whichever is 1st.
I suspect that it will take at least a few more weeks, before the build-up effects of this mess can be cleared from my brain.
