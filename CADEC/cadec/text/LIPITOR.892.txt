At first I had muscle pain, but that faded out.
Next effect was short term memory: I would gas up, then try to pay without hanging up the pump.
When I not only paid someone's bill but also drove off WITHOUT HANGING UP THE PUMP, I stopped taking the drug.
While it did lower my Cholesterol numbers (as did Simvastatin afterwards), I'm not sure it was worth it.
Especially when I forget something important to my job and which I should have overlearned from years of gassing up cars.
Memory is one of the things that cholesterol is used for making, and to me anything that cuts it off is best avoided.
