severe edema of lower extremities that got worse when walking/exercising/sitting/standing, vision problems, muscle weakness (lift weights every day but couldn't open a bottle of water), shoulder pain (every morning regardless of sleeping position), numbness on left side, rapid pulse, productive cough, poor coordination while walking (kept bumping into things), light-headedness (hurt to hold my head up or turn my head from side to side and that made driving real difficult), 25% weight gain (due to doctor-recommended eating to relieve light-headedness).
diuretics taken to relieve edema caused cholesterol to go higher and M.D. recommended more Lipitor which made the edema worse and so on; got off that downward spiral 2 months ago and cholesterol went right back up to 300+ within a week but I'll take my chances and try to find some way other than statins so I can get some quality of life back.
