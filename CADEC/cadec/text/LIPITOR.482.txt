Two days after starting the lipitor I felt like my insides were vibrating.
I wasn't sure what caused it so continued to take the lipitor.
I began getting very severe muscle pain in my left shoulder, arm and chest area.
I was told by the doctor that I probably pulled a muscle.
After 6 weeks of taking lipitor and constant pain and twitching I took myself off of the medication.
I continue to have constant twitching and muscle aches in my legs but I've learned to deal with it.
I've been off of the medication about 2 months and I'm still waiting for it to improve.
