I have been on Lipitor 40mg. for 2 years.
GREAT results.
Went from 256 to 135 and LDL from 201 to 65.
In the past 3 weeks, I have been experiancing TERRIBLE abdominal pain, shortness of breath, and EXTREME muscle pains.
I'm a pharmacist, so I know all to well what these side effects are from.
I've stopped taking it, but the effects are a slow go.
I would NOT reccomend lipitor to anyone.
