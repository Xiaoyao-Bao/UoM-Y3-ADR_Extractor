Joint pain, back and shoulder pain, arm pain, numbness and tingling in the hands.
Edema of hands and ankles.
Blurred vision and memory loss.
Arthritic type pain in all joints.
I could barely get out of bed in the morning or walk up stairs.
I was depressed that.
I realized that I felt better in the late afternoon and evening.
I had been taking the Lipitor at night.
Therefore, I knew that its effects were wearing off at that time.
I've stopped it for 3 days and feel 100% better.
Very scary drug.
