None.
Doctor warned of possible muscle pain but none was experienced.
Cholesterol was 240, 10mg reduced it to 190 but still developed Coronary Artery Disease.
20mg and 30 mg reduced it to 160 but did not reduce triglycerides until 40mg.
Conclusion: drug will lower cholesterol but not CHD risk.
Diet, excercise, niacin all help but have stress test and know heart attack symptoms regardless.
