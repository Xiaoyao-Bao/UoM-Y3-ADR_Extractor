experienced severe muscle weakness,lost 30 pounds (all Muscle), I had relatively little pain but couldn't lift my arms or legs.
The muscles just deteriorated.
I have since been diagnosed with polymyositis .
exacerbated by Lipitor.
It has taken me two years since stopping lipitor to be able to walk again.
Luckily after being admited to the hospital I was seen by a rheumatologist who knew what she was seeing.
I will never get back the full use of my arms or legs.
ALL STATIN drugs are dangerous.
I have heard from two other people who have ended up with Polymyositis from Lipitor.
