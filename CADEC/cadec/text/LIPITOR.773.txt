extremly bad pains in hands,arms,shoulders.
I took lipitor 10mg for only about two months,then cardiologist increased it to 20mg.
In one week i started to get very bad pains in hands,arms and shoulders,at the same time freezing cold,like arms plunged into freezing water,then burning sensations.
after being messed about by doctors not believing it was statins,i came across the website about side effects of statins,and all was revealed.
I told my doctor i would never take statins again.
I stopped them about eight weeks ago.
but have gone from bad to worse in most terribe pain and no painkillers have any effect.
During the night,it is even worse,last night I cried with pain.
but there does not seem to be an answer.
I now warn all my friends about statins and their side effects.
I now wonder if the pain will ever go.
