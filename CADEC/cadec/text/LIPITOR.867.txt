Took 10 mg. for two years with no problems, then started to have burning,numb feet in toe area - both feet.
Also, had discomfort in right side upper and lower of stomach area.
After assorted blood tests which were all normal, read an article regarding neurophathy and statins drugs.
Stopped the Lipitor and slowly the stomach discomfort went away, but two years later my feet are still a mess.
Would not take this or any other statin drug.
