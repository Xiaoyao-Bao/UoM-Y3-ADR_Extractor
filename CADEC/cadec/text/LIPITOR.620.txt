Mostly Tingling/burning in arms and legs and back of neck, Some lightheadedness, some memory loss, some chest pain, pain in shoulder-feels like arm pulled out of socket.
Lowered my cholesterol from 270 to 180 in a month.
LDL and triglycerides dropped to 100.
I need to take this due to bad family history, but not sure how much I can take.
The side effects are very distracting.
I have been on this for a month and so far I am tolerating this, but if the side effects get worse, I would have to decide if dying at 60 from a heart attack is worse than living in misery until 80.
