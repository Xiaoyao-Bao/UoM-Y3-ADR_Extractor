Absolutely none!.
I was originally taking 150mg per day, but cut it to 100mg because the lesser dose seemed to work as well.
My internist had urged me to take Vioxx, Celebrx and Bextra (at different times, of course), but the relief I experienced was not as dramatic as the Cataflam.
My orthopaedic surgeon prescribes the Cataflam.
It has a slight effect on my blood pressure, but, since my pressure is usually low, that is not considered a health risk.
