Memory loss/ability to concentrate.
Prescribed 20mg for the past 3 years or so, my cholesterol levels have all been normal since starting this medicine.
Originally I was given Crestor 10mg, but experienced muscle pain, and was given Lipitor.
The only problem is I feel I have suffered memory loss and the ability to concentrate since taking this medication.
