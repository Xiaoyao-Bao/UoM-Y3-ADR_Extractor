after taking for about 1 yr, I noticed muscle pain and weakness in both arms on and off.
I ache 24 hrs a day.
This is now continous for about 6 weeks.
I called MD today, he said stop taking lipitor immediately and sent me to lab for blood tests to determine if any damage done to liver, muscles or heart.
I wish I had called MD sooner.
Hope if any damage, it is reversible.
