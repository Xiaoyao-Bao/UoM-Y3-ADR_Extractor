My doctor switched me from Pravachol to Lipitor almost a year ago because of a study that was done in CHF patients and when Lipitor was used, hospitalizations were cut almost in half.
Normally I have to go into the hospital a minimum of 2 times a year.
Since I started taking Lipitor, I have not been in the hospital even once!
Also, he also told me that Lipitor was better for my kidneys than the statins.
