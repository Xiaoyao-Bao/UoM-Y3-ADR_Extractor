I have had unexplained fatigue (sleeping 11-12 hours a night, and still having no energy all day)since starting Lipitor 2 years ago; my new doctor did a new test and said my SED rate is high- he suspects it is the Lipitor and told me to go off it immediately.
I don't know if this is the problem, but after reading this site I will not take a statin drug again.
I also have short term memory loss, and an unexplained cough.
Sure, it lowers cholesterol, but I am a zombie.
