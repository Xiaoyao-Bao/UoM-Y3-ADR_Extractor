Extended periods of low mood, loss of self-confidence, loss of interest in life etc also brain fog & impaired memory.
Increased to 40mg/day in the last 6 months and then stopped taking it after reading of similiar symptoms on this website.
After 2 weeks, the symptoms had gone and 8 weeks later they still have not returned.
Won't be taking this anymore.
