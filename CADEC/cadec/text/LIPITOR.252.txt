Not sure--I'm taking several medications so I don't know if the others may cause some minor side effects.
10 mg dosage lowered cholesterol from 170 to 31 from July to Nov 06!
I did change my diet also from almost no beef to almost entirely chicken and avoided butters/margerines.
I am now on 5mg dosage and niaspan to raise HDL.
