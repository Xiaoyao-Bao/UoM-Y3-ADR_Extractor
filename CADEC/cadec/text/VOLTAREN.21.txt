I was on Voltaren to work as an anti-inflammatory for my infection.
The drug was horrible.
On second day of my medication, I experience an excruciating pain in my stomach, like gastric - but much worse.
Along with that I also had a sharp pain on my shoulder and couldnt sit straight.
I was admitted to hospital after 20 min of the pain and given MORPHINE when my doc knew that I was on Voltaren.
It was acute gastritis.
Worst adverse reaction I have ever experience.
Doc told me to opt for non-NSAIDs such as aspirin next time.
