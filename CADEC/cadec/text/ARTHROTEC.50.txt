no side effects.
Met with surgon last week to schedule hip replacement.
Could not tolerate pain.
Was on hydrocodine heavy aand did not like side effects.
Almost overnight was 100% pain free.
Sorry ladies i don not have bleeding or stomach pains.
Truly wish you could have same results as i have.
Took 5 years ago for shoulder pain and it worked as well.
I am on my feet all day requiring steps and was ready to retire.
I danced at a wedding this weekend for the first time in 3 years.
