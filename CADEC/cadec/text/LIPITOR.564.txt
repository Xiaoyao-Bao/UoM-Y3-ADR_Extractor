Right back again.

I have been to neurologists and had emg,bone Dr.for xrays primary Dr And now the major hospital to the big guys.
I will have a more intense emg and then they will do biopsies on my limbs and thigh.

I guess it's the forbidden word to say if it's something negetive.
This stuff is definitely for everybody.
By the way I was only on it approx 4 months.
Sad to read so many people are suffering from side effects of this but good to know I am not nuts and I am not alone.
A huge money maker so I doubt it will ever be taken off the market.
I've read short term and long term users of this stuff.
I am beginnig to wonder if it's just a matter of time for everyone who's on it.
