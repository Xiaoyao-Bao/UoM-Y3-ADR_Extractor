Slight muscle soreness in arms and legs.
Major sorness in knees and elbows.
I have gout and had been attributing the joint pain to that, but after bloodwork, my rheumatologist said it was not gout!
I have an appt. scheduled to start to deal with this pain but an experience last night and reading some postings on this site are leading me to suspect the lipitor.
My usual 20mg dose is taken with dinner, but I had forgotten to take it and remembered just before bedtime.
I awoke at 3AM with an a knee that was just throbbing with pain.
I hobbled to the bathroom and took a dose of Advil and was able to get back to sleep after about a half hour.
I awoke this morning with about a 50% reduction in pain and it seems to have subsided as the day goes on.
I will never take lipitor before bed again, I may cut the daily dose in half and possibly stop altogether if the pain persists at an intolerable level.
Lipitor has lowered my cholesterol levels to the 180's.
I had never had a reading below 218 in my life and it has been steadily rising over the last few years to a consistent level in the 240's.
The ratio of bad to good cholesterol is in the acceptable zone and never had been before taking lipitor.
So, all in all, the lipitor has done a good job.
I will try to cope with the joint pain, but if it becomes a constant problem, I will have to stop taking the drug.
