Been taking Lipitor for two years.
The last few days I have experienced swollen legs and ankles and a pain in my lower leg making it hard to get around.
Thought it might be the Lipitor so I am going to the doctor in a few days.
I think I will discontinue using Lipitor and try to find another alternative to lowering my cholesterol.
