I have been recently diagnosed with Possible Early Parkinson's symptoms.
Lipitor is the only medication I have been taking.
I had joint pains, light headedness(problem keeping balance),Tremors in Right hand, and my hand writting had deteriorated to the extent that I had problem signing cheques.
Lipitor(10mg) was very helpful in reducing LDL and Tri-Glycerides, but becuase of the side effects I have stopped taking it for last month.
I am now taking CQ-10(50mg)twice a day and Fish Oil (1200mg) once a day and improving.
I would like to contact others who experienced Parkinson's symptoms with Lipitor.
