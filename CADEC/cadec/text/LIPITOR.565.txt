Had no side effects, liver tests always normal.
Would give it a '5', but it isn't the best med for me.
Triglycerides and cholesterol were getting worse every year; diet/exercise did not help much.
First on Lopid (Gemfibrozil) which worked OK, but had gall bladder out as a result!
Doc put me on Lipitor.
While it did help get the overall numbers down somewhat, I am still very high.
(Untreated TG 1700; w/drug 700-1100.
Chol too high to measure came down to 280-350.
Cardiologist now switching me to Tricor (scary) which is working better for my particular situation, but not as pleasant to take.
