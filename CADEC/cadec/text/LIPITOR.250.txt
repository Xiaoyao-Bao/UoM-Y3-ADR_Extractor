heel pain goiing into my ankle.
heel is hot and feels like i am walking on a stone.
when i go off off the lipitor for a few days it gets better.
i took this for 6 months 20 mg and did not have a problem but my coalesteral went back up to 250 even though i am not a big meat eater.
iI have been on it for 4 months this time.
i am going off it for good and see if my foot gets better.
it has bothered me for 2 months thought I had the goat.
I am 74 female and not a drinker or eat rich food.
