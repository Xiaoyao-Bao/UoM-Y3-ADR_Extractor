extreme muscle pain in arms and shoulders Particularly in bed at night.
I was on a very high dose (80mg)as I had two heart attacks attributable to blockages.
I have been off them for 4 weeks with only a small amount of improvement.
I have heard it can take several months to get back to any where near normal.
