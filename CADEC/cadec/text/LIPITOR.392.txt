Severe lower back pain after increasing Lipitor form 10-20 mg.
I couldn't get out of bed or walk after taking it for about one week.
I stopped taking it and I have pain in my right leg.
It has been three weeks and it is still hard to walk and go to work.
I thought I had the flu for the first week when I first started taking 10 mg.
about two years ago.
Now after getting the back pain when we doubled the dosage, I think it wasn't the flu but a reaction to the drug.
