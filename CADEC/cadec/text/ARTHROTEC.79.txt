Nothing unusual or that Im aware of .
I have some acid reflux thats developed over the last few years, which may not be related since it runs in the family.
Works great!
Hard to function without (pain),when I ran out.
Im probably addicted to it.
Somewhat concerned about the long term effects and listed possible side effects, so I've only ever taken arthrotec 50 once daily rather than twice, which is just enough to manage my pain levels.
I feel it has a cummulative effect.
maybe.
I dont think anything will completely remove the pain, and maybe shouldnt since it helps you to know whats going on.
Else how much would you have to take, thus increasing your risk for possible adverse reactions.
