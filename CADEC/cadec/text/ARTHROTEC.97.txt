The symptoms got progressively worse with time.
They included fluid retention, all over muscle pain, cramps.
I stopped taking them a week ago and felt much better the next day.
Some of the side effects haven't totally disappeared but I'm improving with each day.
My doctor doesn't believe that this medication could cause this reaction.
