I started Lipitor more than two years ago.
Cholesterol levels were just right.
However, about a month ago, I started to feel leg pain/spasm/weakness/depressed/suicidal, joint pain and so forth.
I stopped taking it the same day I felt these symptoms.
My regular exercise and badminton both have been affected by this medication.
May be in the near future I would take this drug company to court.
If you feel any of the symptoms, please dicontinue this drug.
