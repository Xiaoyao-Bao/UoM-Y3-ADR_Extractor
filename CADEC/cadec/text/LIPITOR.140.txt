I have been taken for approximately 4 yrs.
I have some difficulty with digestive system and some muscle pain and joint pain.
Lipitor did the job on my cholesterol both LDL and HDL.
I have quit taken recently to see if it affects above problems.
It probably is a trade off.
I feel that the drug is too expensive.
I do think that it will do what it is used for, but I think your body pays a price.
Again I think it is a trade off.
