uncontrollable Diarrhea,kidney function.
This product is the best medicine for arthritis pain I have ever taken, however after taking it for approx. 10 years it started affecting my kidneys, my stomach(acid reflux) and the diarrhea got worse, short term, I had no problems,this would be a great product if the manufacturer could get rid of the side effects.
