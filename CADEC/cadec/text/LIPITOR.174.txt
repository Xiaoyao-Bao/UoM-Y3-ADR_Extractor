Joint pain especially spine at 10mg.

I had this reaction before but my doctor doubted it would be the lipitor.
Stopped lipitor and symptems went away.
Restarted lipitor at 5 mg and after 7 days seem to be having wicked joint pain again.
Will stop lipitor again and see results.
By the way 10 mg dropped my LDL to 77.
