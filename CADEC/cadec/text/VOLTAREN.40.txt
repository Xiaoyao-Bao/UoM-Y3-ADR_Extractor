I was on celebrex till the SCARE of death took me off.
Went on voltaren.
Had wild dreams,gurgling stomach,tired, moody.
4 months ago my heart stopped and they said I have high blood press.
I never had it before.
I find out on the net that voltaren over long times can actually cause hypertension.
I now use tylenol extra for arthritis.
Voltaren should in my opinion be given rectally to the mfg.
It did alleviate the arthritis pain.
It also made me dependent on tagamet after a few years.
ThenI find out they two are not to be taken together.
I was on voltaren for over 3 years.
