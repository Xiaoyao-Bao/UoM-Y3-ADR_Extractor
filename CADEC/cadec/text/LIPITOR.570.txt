Muscle Pain in left arm and upper back.
Hair dryness, breakage and loss.
I was able to stop the muscle pain in its tracks by taking CoQ10 supplements but the hair dryness, breakage and loss is not good.
Currently trying to find a supplement to counter hair loss.
If I can find something, I will stay on Lipitor.
It has lowered my Cholesterol from 11.7 to 7 !
My doctor wanted me to switch from Lipitor to Lipidil Micro as I was so upset by the hair loss and muscle pain but I have stopped having muscle pain by taking CoQ10 and before I switch to another drug that may have other side effects, I want to research it (Lipidil) further.
If anyone has experienced hair loss on Lipidil please let me know.
