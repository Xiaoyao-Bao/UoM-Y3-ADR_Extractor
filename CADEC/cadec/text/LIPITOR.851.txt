After 1 year on Lipitor, I experienced severe pain in both hips & legs, would wake up with so much pain at night that I would get out of bed for relief.
Even after 3 months of nonuse, I still have stiffness, weakness & pain in both legs/ hips, especially right side & now limp.
I have started physical therapy, massage theraphy & pain medicine.
