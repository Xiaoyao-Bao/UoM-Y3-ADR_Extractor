Acid Reflux, stomach pain, muscle pain, trouble with liver count.
I took this drug and it did the job - lowered my cholesterol - at first.
But then the other stuff started.
At first indigestion all the time, stomach pain, muscle aches - Dr was testing my count for liver problems - suddenly count was so high it put me in the hospital, yellow skin, eyes, urine dark brown.
Scary.
Ran all kinds of tests - surprise - can't take Statin drugs.
Personally I don't think they are worth it after that scary experience!.
