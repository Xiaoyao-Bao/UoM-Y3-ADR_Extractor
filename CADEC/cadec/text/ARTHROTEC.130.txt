Some swelling of the legs.
I had been unable to get relief from my pain for 2 months following a bone marrow biopsy.
I was up to 30 arthritis strength tylenol and numerous Tylenol 3 daily.
Couldn't sleep because of the pain.
No concentration.
Loosing days of work.
Within 2 days of taking the arthrotec 50 (twice daily), the pain was gone.
Even the arthritic pain I had in the knees and an ankle.
gone.
I can sleep again.
It is great to be able to sleep & function again.
