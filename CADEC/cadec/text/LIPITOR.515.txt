Calf muscles (and foot) tire very quickly.
This often leads to leg/foot cramps.
Comparable to fatigue after a long workout.
I have been taking Lipitor for about 4 yrs - the muscle tiring has become worse with time and now will 'act' up very soon even with a short slow walk.
This has severely hampered my ability to excercise.
I first thought this was a response to the diabetes but was recently made aware that Lipitor may be causing it.
Lipitor did lower my chloesterol soon after starting it.
It doesn't seem as effective now.
I'm going to stop taking it because of the muscle fatigue/cramping - hopefully this condition will reverse.
