Doc put me on 10 mg/day.
Some stomach discomfort initially, but I seemed to get over that after the first few weeks.
Some muscle aches and pains which I didn't have before now seem to come and go.
Wife says that I am a lot grouchier since I started taking it.
And just yesterday, was out doing the yard spring clean-up, and noticed extreme fatigue and shortness of breath.
Very worrisome.
I have stopped taking Lipitor, and will check back with my doctor asap.
I just recently had my 3 month cholesterol check-up, and the doctor was very pleased since my overall cholesterol count dropped to 3.7 from over 7.
I also take Atacand for high blood pressure - have been on that one for years.
He doesn't know yet about the fatigue and shortness of breath attacks, because that just happened.
