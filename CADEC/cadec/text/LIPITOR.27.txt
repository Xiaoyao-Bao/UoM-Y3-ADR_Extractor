I have headache, muscle ache, diarrhea, indigestion, abdominal pain, back pain, eyesight has changed sinus problems, joint pain, leg cramps.
I have fibromyalgia also and my pain should be at a lower level instead of worse.
I am stopping this on my own tomorrow!
My doctor never even suggested diet first!.
