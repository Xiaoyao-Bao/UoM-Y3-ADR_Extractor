At the beginning I did not had any side effects, until a few months after start taking Lipitor I experienced pain in the lower legs, sometimes I could not even walk in the mornings my muscles were very stiff.
After consulting with my doctor he told me to stop taking Lipitor until the pain went away and to start taking it after the pain was gone.
I followed the doctor's order.
After a few more months of taking Lipitor I began to develop severe pain in the muscles in the shoulder area, upper back and neck, the pain and stiffness of my neck was so bad that sometimes I couldn't even turn my head when I was driving.
I went to my doctor and she thought it was stress.
I took off work for a month and during this time I tried to relax and the pain did not go away.
I decided to be off Lipitor on my own and within a couple of weeks, the pain and stiffness from the neck and pain in the shoulder and back is going away, I feel much better now that I am not taking Lipitor.
I do not think I will take Lipitor ever again, the problems that have been causing me are too much to risk my health again.
I will look for alternatives ways of reducing my collesterol.
