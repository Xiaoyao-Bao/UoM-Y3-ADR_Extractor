Muscle aches and pains.
Stiffness of limbs.
When I sat down for a bit and then stood up, I couldn't move my legs.
I had to wait a bit before I could get moving.
Also developed plantar fasciitis in my feet.
I couldn't get down the stairs in the morning, I was crawling.
I had cortison shots in my feet (these were just as painful) but they didn't work.
Stopped taking Lipitor and I haven't felt better.
I noticed a difference within a week.
These drugs are poison and should be taken off the market.
I am now taking CoQ10 with Vitamin E to try and heal my body.
From all the reading I have done, the doctor should have told me to take this because the statins deplete your body of CoQ10.
