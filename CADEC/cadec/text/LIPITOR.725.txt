nausea.
which progressively got worse the longer I took it.
It became so extreme - it was causing me to be dysfunctional.
The final week it turned into extreme vomiting and diarrhea.
I thought I had a flu bug that just would not go away.
As soon as I quit taking the Lipitor - I had my life back.
I also experienced memory loss and extreme tiredness.
I might also mention that I started on 10mg and experienced really no side effects.
but when I was up'd to 20 mg it all started to go downhill.
