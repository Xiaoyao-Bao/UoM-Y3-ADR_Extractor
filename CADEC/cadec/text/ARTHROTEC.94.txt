Experienced excruciating, unusual abdominal pain (bowel, uterine) and lower back pain for about 5 hours after taking (including diarrhea 6 times), and heart palpitations and vaginal bleeding for about a day after taking.
I took with 2 aspirin (which I've since learned is contraindicated) and some fruit.
This may be the reason for problems in my case.
I will not take it again as the pain was extreme, but others should be cautious to take with lots of food and no aspirin.
