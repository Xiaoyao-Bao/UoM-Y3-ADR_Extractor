One hour after taking Arthrotec, I experienced the sudden onset of severe mentrual cramps.
I am on the birth control pill and should not have my period for another 3 weeks.
I am in so much pain that I cannot sleep, nor can I take Advil for the pain as it is also an NSAID.
The patient warning indicates that this drug can cause an abortion.
I wish I'd read my entire monograph before taking the tablet.
I would not recommend for women prior to menopause.
Nor sure why my doctor thought it would help my endo pain.
