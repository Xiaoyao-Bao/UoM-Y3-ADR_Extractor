I have had several boughts of severe muscle cramps that lead to dehydration.
I have had these while on Lipitor and Zocor.
There is no way I can be dehydrated because I am now aware of the problem and drink water and gatorade consantly when I am outside.
This site has been amazing to me.
I am 37 and have been on statins for 13 years.
Other than the cramps I also have fatigue, muscle twitching, foot pain (10 x-rays), and numbness and tingling in the hands and arms.
.
I went to the doctor last week about the cramps, and he took me off Zocor and I am going to wait and see how things are doing.
The drugs do lower cholesterol.
