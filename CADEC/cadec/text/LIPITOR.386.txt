I was on 10 mgs. and then cut it in half for over two years.
Stopped taking it 11/04 due to severe legs problems; muscle aches/weakness/stiffness, cramps in my feet and hands, pain in my arms and chest, memory problems along with vision problems.
This drug needs to be taken off the market and doctors need to realize how much damage it has done to many innocent people.
