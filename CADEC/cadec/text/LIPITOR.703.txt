Severe back pain, muscle degenerating, can barely walk, extreme fatique,depression,major gastrointestinal problems, feel like an old man.
Fever, sweats, chills.
Insomnia,fitfull sleep.
Neck pain,cracking sensations in my joints.
All joints and muscles hurt.
Have been going to Drs. trying to find out what is wrong.
All tests comimg back negative except ck which is positive.
They tell me I might have arthritis.
Have been on this drug since the beginning before that Zocor.
Am getting worse everyday.
Nobody ever said anything about all these side affects.
But have been complaining to my Dr for a while now of terrible muscle pain and nothing was mentioned that it could be Lipitor.
Been tested for everything from malaria to lupus.
Was always physically fit and not overweight and maintained an active lifestyle but this has sapped every ounce of energy I have and can't do much of anything anymore.
Have an appointment with my Dr in a few days and I will be bringing a printout of this site.
There are other people who are suffering just like me.
Now I know what the hell is wrong and will be off Lipitor.
My quaility of life has suffered too long on this garbage.
Thank God I found this site.
