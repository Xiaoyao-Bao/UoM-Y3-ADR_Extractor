Gradually declining physical ability.
Joint pain (elbows!), buzzing left leg (I thought my cell phone was in my pocket on vibrate!).
Occasional loss of balance, MEMORY LOSS!, blurred vision.
Dropped total Cholesterol from 245 to 185.
GREAT SITE!
I'm appalled at the state of the cholesterol war.
My HDL has always been in the 60's which put me at a ratio of 4.0 or better.
Dr.'s used to say that was all that mattered.
NOW, my new Dr prescribes Lipitor as my numbers are 'alarming'.
As an ex-olympic athlete, I still compete at a Masters level at age 43 and enjoy being a good athlete.
I have a high tolerance for pain, so the pain wasn't an issue, but I feel like I've aged 20 years!
I've slowed down considerably and don't have the tolerance I once did.
My short-term memory disappeared.
Not that I would have noticed, but my wife was getting increasingly mad at my apparent lack of attention!
I'm going off this drug and trying the vitamin C approach.
Else, the heck with it.
Through exercise, I'll keep my HDL high and work on the ratio rule.
I'm convinced this drug will kill me before any possible heart disease!.
