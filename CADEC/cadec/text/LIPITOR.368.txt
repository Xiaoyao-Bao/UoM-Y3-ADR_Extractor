After four months on 20 mg suffered calf pains in middle of night.
After 6 months cut dose in half, still calf pains once in a while.
Now after 2+ years noticed my left hip was bothering me so that sometimes I had to walk a little funny.
Thought I might need hip replacement (age 71), but it dawned on me that maybe the Lipitor might be the cause of that too.
I cut dose again in half and am taking only 5 mg.
Now after one week I notice that hip does not hurt any more.
