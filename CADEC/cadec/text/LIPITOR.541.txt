So sad to see so many with problems like mine!
Progressively worsening problems with joint pain, muscle pain, depression and tiredness.
Doctor has ran all sorts of tests and oculdn't find anything wrong, everyone was pointing to arthristis.
I stopped taking Lipitor and many of the problems went away after 2 days.
I'm not going back to it.
