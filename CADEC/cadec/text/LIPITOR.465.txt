I started taking Lipitor after my cholesterol climbed to 310.
I Did not want to take it because I am a vegetarian, a health conscious person and dislike taking medicines, but my doctor, an endocrynologist, strongly recommended it.
The first few months I was not aware of any side effects, but about a month ago I started to experience wrist pain, I thought it was my pilates class, but although I rested for 2 months from the class, the pain continued.
Then about two weeks ago, I got very bad cramps in my toes, they curled down and the pain was terrible.
About a week ago I was taking a bath and my muscles in my lower abdomen started to contract then the cramp got higher.
I got scared that I was having something bad.
After the cramps one night I had such tiredness in my left leg that I could hardly walk, I thought that it was my high heels that I had worn all day.
Then 2 days ago I woke up with a swollen foot, it was very painful to walk.
That was it.
I suspected that it was the Lipitor and came to the internet and read the same side effects in a lot of people posting their experiences with this drug.
I even thought that I had ALS since a friend of mine died of it.
It is amazing the amount of people that also thought the same in this list.
Thanks God for the Internet.
I stopped taking this medicine 2 days ago, I hope that I can get rid of these effects and that they are not permanent.
I do not recommend it, unless it is life threatening and then only take it for a short time.
