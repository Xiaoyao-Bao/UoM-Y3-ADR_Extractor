None for the first 5 years.
It DID lower my cholesterol.
However, in the 6th year, I developed terrible ankle/knee/leg/hip pain, aching and soreness.
I thought I had a muscle problem.
I got so weak I had to use a cane to walk.
Then, I had to use the handicapped carts in the grocery store.
Then I had to get a handicapped permit because I could not walk more than 25 steps.
I could not sleep for the ache and discomfort in my legs.
I was sure I was a few months away from a wheelchair.
I was horribly depressed.
When I asked my doctor about this pain, he took me off Lipitor, and within one week my pain had stopped completely.
I can walk fine, I can even run.
I sleep like a baby.
However, I still cannot walk very far - I think I have lost a lot of muscle tone.
I will have to build my strength back up in my legs.
Otherwise, I feel ten years younger.
