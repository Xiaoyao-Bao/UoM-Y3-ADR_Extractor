Arm stiffness.
Dizziness.
Been feeling horrible the past 2 years and have gone to several doctors.
I've been an off and on user of Lipitor for 5 years -- 10 MG dosage.
Cholestorol lowered but started developing neurological problems about 3 months ago after restarting the drug leading to Major stiffness in right shoulder, then right arm and now left arm.
Stopped taking Lipitor 10 days ago.
Hopefully arm symptoms will subside.
