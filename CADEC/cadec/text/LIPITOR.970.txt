pain!!!!!
I felt like I had sever arthritic condition.
even tried two times per week with same results.
tried other statins with same side effect .
presently on crestor one time per week with occasional side effect of mild pain.
MD said one time a week can be very effective for patients that have reaction to statins.
Have not had bloodwork as yet to see if helped.
