Went to hospital for my Tmj pain because it was getting out of control.
A doctor prescribed me this to take two a day.
One pill and 20 minutes later the worse period cramps in my life.
After half an hour it passed, but its been a day a half now, and i still feel sick after eating and random shooting lower abdominal pains.
I'm scared to death.
