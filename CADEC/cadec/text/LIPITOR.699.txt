Other than mild flatulance and things of this nature, I did not connect Lipitor to the terrible low back pain I have had for about 5 months.
but after reading comments on this website, I am wondering about this back and neck pain that worsens.
It is a miracle drug along with Vitamin E and additional Premarin.
My cholesterol was over 600 a number of years back.
I've tried at least 5 other meds for this condition but this one is most effective.
The lowest the other ones took it was to 300.
My endocrinologist thought this was going to be the best it could be controlled.
So, I really believe in this drug, but must consider what it may be doing to my body and my degree of pain.
I have taken Lipitor since it was approved 4 or so years ago.
If anyone has any experience like mine, please email me.
For the past year my reading is around 170.
