my legs and arms started going numb and tingling.
extreme fatigue, some concentration problems and feeling stupid .
doctor said no way could it be possible it was a side effect.
no way, no how.
after four months i stopped taking it figuring i had nothing to lose.
after three weeks symptons have almost gone away.
no way no how would i take this drug again.
