My EKG was not good and a blood test also indicated a problem.
I was sent for a stress test which I failed, and was sent to a heart doctor.
I had no other symptoms of heart problems, but I had high blood pressure and overweight.
So lipitor was prescribed to lessen likelihood of partial blockage to my heart.
Cholesterol levels are terrific now and I may be sent for another stress test next month.
I feel great on Lipitor but could not take Zocor(side effects).
