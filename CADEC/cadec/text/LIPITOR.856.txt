It concerns me that someone else is recommending SIMVISTATIN as an alternative to LIPITOR.
Up until 3 weeks ago I was taking LIPEX which is SIMVISTATIN - it reduced my cholesterol very satisfactorily.
However - over time, the following symptoms developed - pain in hips cannot walk even a short distance due to pain.
Legs felt like they had run a marathon!
Deep bruising - I thought I was just being clumsy.
Joint pain in spine, hips and elbows.
Exhaustion.
A colleague asked if I was on cholesterol medication and informed me there could be a connection - I found this website - amazed at all the similarities to me - I thought I was going MAD!!!
I came of LIPEX 3 weeks ago, muscles feel better, energy levels picking up, but hip pain still throbbing.
I also felt like an old woman, I have over the years been to physiotherapists and chiropractors who did not know what to do - recently diagnosed with bursitis in the hips had 2 cortizone injections - still suffering severe hip pain and cannot walk more than 5 yards.
Doctor agreed I could be having severe side effects of STATIN drug - has insisted I need my cholesterol attended to - has now put me on BEZALIP (no relation to STATINS so I am told) I haven't filled the script yet - need to do more research.
My heart goes out to all of you!.
