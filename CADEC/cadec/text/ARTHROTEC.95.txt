Terrible first of all I had diarrhoea my doseage was increased to 75 and a few days ago my feet and ankles started swelling up.
I went to my GP and the results of my blood test showed there was something wrong with my liver and I am a non-drinker.
My blood pressure had gone sky high so my that is why the swelling.
I was told to stop taking Arthrotec and am now using a natural product that seems to work it is called Pernamax.
