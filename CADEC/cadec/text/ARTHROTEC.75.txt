Vaginal bleeding when it was not time for my period, headaches, neck pain,bloating and weight gain.
It helped relieve the pain in my lower back but I would not recommend this to be used by women of any age.
Not quite sure what I will do now because I cannot take Bextra or Neurontin.
I guess go back to plain old advil and deal with it unless the doctor has another medication I can try.
