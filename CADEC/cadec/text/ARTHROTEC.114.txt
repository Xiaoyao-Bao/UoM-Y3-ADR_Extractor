15 minutes after taking , i experienced severe stomach cramping.
but after trying celebrex (without any relief).
i decided i could tolerate stomach pain since i go relief.
BUT now after having been off of meds for 3 weeks, I am experiencing high blood pressure and ankle swelling like crazy!!!!!
HAS ANYONE EXPERIENCED THIS AFTER BEING OFF OF THE DRUG FOR 3 WEEKS OR SO???????.
never take again!!!!.
