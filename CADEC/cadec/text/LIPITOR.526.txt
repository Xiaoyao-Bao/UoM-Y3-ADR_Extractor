10 MG a day of lipitor and 6 months later I have extreme leg pain in the calves after just walking a few blocks, in a brain fog with memory loss, Vision is giving me problems and feel like shit all the time.
This drug should have a pre-qualifier before perscribed or better yet.
take all the statin drugs off the market.
This drug is dangerous.
I'm almost inspired to start my own web site to warn people of the risk in taking any statin drug for a quick fix.
