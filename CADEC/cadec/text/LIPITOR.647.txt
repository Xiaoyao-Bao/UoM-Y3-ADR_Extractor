My feet feel like I have stone bruises just in front of the heel.
My hips hurt on both sides when I get up.
I walk like an old person.
My doctor noticed a rough sound in my lungs and a heart murmur that was never mentioned before.
I'm having tests next week for both.
I was OK taking 20mg but the doctor raised me to 40mg about 4 months ago.
It's only since then that I've had these symptoms.
I'll probably quit completely though.
I'm not physically able to do anything much.
And at a young 50 that is just not acceptable.
