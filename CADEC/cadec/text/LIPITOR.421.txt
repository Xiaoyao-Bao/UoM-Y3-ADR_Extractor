After taking Lipitor(20mg)for 11 months, developed flu-like syptoms such as dizziness,nausea, muscle aches,loss of energy & productivity, headaches (which I never get).
Have had these symptons for more than 60 days.
Quit taking Lipitor 2 weeks ago.
Still no change in side affects.
I was very active and in good health prior to taking this medication.
Lowered my cholesterol from 260 to 170.
Doctor states side affects are very rare and thinks problems are not related.
Recommend exercise and proper diet to achieve results.
Please do not take this medication.
I came across this web-page as a last resort for my agony.
Thanks to others for contributing.
