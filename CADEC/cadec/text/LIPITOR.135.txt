headache, gas, bloating, mood swings, ill feeling, paranoid, anxious.
My Dr said my cholesterol was very high.
SO she put me on Lipitor.
I was so sick over Christmas Holiday and did not know why.
Could not eat, sleep.
felt so gassy and my belly blew up like a balloon.
When I stopped taking it, I felt back to normal.
Ill do it naturally with eating healthily with salmon and olive oil and veggies.
