While this medicine did help with my pain, the side affects out-weigh the benefits.
My menstrual cycle is completely out of whack, I'm bleeding several times a month.
Nausea occurs when I'm hungry - very odd.
Irregular cramping.
This has been to date the only medicine to relieve my hip pain, but it's affecting my quality of life.
Who wants to have their period all month long and be non-stop nauseous?!
If they ever fix the kinks I'll be the first in line, but at this point I don't consider this a safe medication.
