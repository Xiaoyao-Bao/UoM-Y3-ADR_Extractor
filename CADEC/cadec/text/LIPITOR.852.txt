No significant side effects.
Slight muscle aches in my back in the morning when I first started taking it, but that passed with time.
I've been taking a 40 mg tablet before bedtime every day for four years.
Combined with a low fat/low cholesterol diet, the drug helped lower my cholesterol to 125 from well over 200.
