I took the drug only once, at about 9:00 p.m.
15 minutes later I experienced dizziness, nausea, and stomach pain, followed about 10 minutes later by level 6 pain in major joints (knees, hips, shoulders, elbows, hands).
Elevated blood pressure and heart palpitations.
Still felt somewhat dizzy and sick the next day.
Extreme gas in stomach and intestines for several days afterward.
Had acid reflux-type symptoms for a few days, though I have never had reflux.
Evil drug!!.
