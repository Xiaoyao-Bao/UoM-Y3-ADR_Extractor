Nagging muscle pain between and just below my shoulder blades, persistent fatigue, moderate insomnia, increasingly unable to focus or stay.
I took 20mg/day for over four years before the totality of the side effects and their likely root cause finally hit me over the head.
The adverse effects were insidiously gradual in their development which kept the alarm bells from going off sooner.
Like many, I attributed each individual symptom to.
