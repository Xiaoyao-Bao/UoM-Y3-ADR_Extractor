Temporary constipation relieved by fiber supplements, gone after about 6 weeks.
Possibly increased hair loss - (and I am female so it is really unfortunate) but thinning hair among women at my age also runs in my mothers family so can't really blame statins.
I have a lipid problem that doesn't respond to diet or exercise.
Agressive cholesterol management is my only option.
Liptor works.
I take 40mgs/day, may be able to lower it since my total cholesterol dropped from 300 to 120 in two months.
My doctor put me on CoQ 10 at the same time as the Lipitor, and explained possible side effects.
Lipitor actually reversed blockages in one of my brothers.
4 out of 5 of us are on statins - 3 Lipitor.
No serious bad effects.
Try CoQ 10 to prevent/reduce side effects.
