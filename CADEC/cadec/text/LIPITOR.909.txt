I HAVE LITTLE CIRCULATION IN MY FINGERS.
NEW RESEARCH SHOWS THAT 40 MG. OF LIPITOR IMPROVES CIRCULATION IN A GOOD AMOUNT OF PATIENTS.
MY DOCTOR CHECKED MY LIVER ENZYMES BEFORE I STARTED.
THEY WERE NORMAL UPON TAKING THE LIPITOR, MY FINGERS STARTED TO FEEL BETTER ON THE 4TH DAY AND THE ULCERATIONS I EXPERIENCE STARTED HEALING.
I WAS SO HAPPY AND SO WAS MY DOCTOR.
HE SAID TO REPEAT MY LAB WORK IN 6 WEEKS.
WELL I JUST FOUND OUT THAT MY LIVER COUNTS ARE TOTALLY WHACY AND I HAVE TO STOP THE DRUG.
I AM GLAD THAT MY DOCTOR IS RIGHT ON TOP OF IT, BUT IT IS SO DISAPPOINTING BECAUSE IT WAS HELPING.
I DID HAVE EXTREME EXHAUSTION BUT THEY SUGGESTED FOR ME TO TAKE IT IN THE MORNING INSTEAD OF NIGHT AND THAT MADE A DIFFERENCE.
AFTER MY LABS ARE DONE AGAIN IN 3 WEEKS, THEY MIGHT TRY ANOTHER STATIN DRUG.
AFTER READING THI WEBSITE, I DON'T HAVE MUCH HOPE.
IT HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL THOUGH.
IT CAN BE A GREAT DRUG FOR MOST, JUST NOT ALL.
