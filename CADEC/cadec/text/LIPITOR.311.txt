Severe achilles tendonitis in both legs, heel pain, burning sensations in calves-maybe Lipitor is why?
I have spent almost a year with this problem and spent 4 months in physical therapy-I am calling my doctor and getting off this drug immediately!!!!
Even if it is not the culprit, I can't take the chance.
