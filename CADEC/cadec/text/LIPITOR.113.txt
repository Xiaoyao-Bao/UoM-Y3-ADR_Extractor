Second time trying this.
First time I got a frozen shoulder.
Triedit a couple of years later and I have back and chest pain that made think i was having a cardio event.
Stopped the Lipitor about a week ago and still having horrible back pain.
If this stuff is damaging my muscles what is it doing to my major muscle.
my HEART!
This is a terrible drug! DO NOT TAKE!
I would rather take the risk of elevated lipids!.
