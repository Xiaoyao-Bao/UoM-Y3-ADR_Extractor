Be careful with this stuff.
Had a total cholesterol of about 230.
saw results after first 3 months.
Had no other health concerns.
Exercised on a regular basis and am in very good shape.
This stuff grabbed me and ruined the this last year of my life.
I have no other risk factors for heart desease except a moderatly elevated cholesterol level, no family history or anything.
Thought I would take lipitor just to be safe.
Big mistake.
Went to my doctor and told him I wasn't going to take the lipitor any more.
Told him I was presenting with some very adverse signs and symptoms and the only thing that had ever changed was the fact i was on Lipitor.
He was not happy with my decision and offered a switch to a different statin, I declined.
He got aggitated and asked what articles I had been reading and where I got my information.
I told him I didn't need a medical journal to convince me this stuff was messing me up, I was living proof.
4-5 days after stopping the Lipitor it was like someonebrought the sun out.
Depression faded along with all the other psychological enigmas I was dealing with.
The only residuals I am now dealing with are some minor muscle aches and twitching, which are slowly getting better.
Folks, drugs can be a wonderful thing but that doesn't mean all drugs are wonderful.
Please, be carefull.
