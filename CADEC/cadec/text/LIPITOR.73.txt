A friend om mine took Lipitor (all statins have similar side effects).
He suffered terrible pains in hips, legs, hands etc Lost his muscular strength, had difficulties to swallow, problems with tinnitus and memory.
The problems appeared little by little over the years.
The best thing you can do for yourself and others is to educate yourself on this - and other medical issues.
Read books, read patient stories and look at The Lipitor Paradox at u-tube.
It`s a very funny and sad story.
Also visit spacedoc.net for more information about side effects.
