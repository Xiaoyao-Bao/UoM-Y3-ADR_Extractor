headaches, extreme tiredness, worse heartburn in back of throat, hunger pangs, dry mouth, severe lower abdominal pain/cramping, very irritable.
Helped with pain BUT side effects outweigh benefits.
No periods for 10 years, but felt like the worst PMS symptoms ever.
This drug should not be taken by women unless misoprostol removed.
As well, GERD much worse.
Stopped taking & contacted doctor.
