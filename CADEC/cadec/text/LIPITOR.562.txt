After taking 3 or 4 times I started having very intense muscle pain with burning from the middle of my back and around my ribs to the center of my chest.
It would last from a few minutes to a couple of hours and then fade away for awhile.
I had the same intense muscle pain with intense burning in my arms, neck and sometimes my legs.
I stopped taking it for a few days and tried it again with the same results.
I stopped taking it but it took at least a month for the muscle pains to stop completely.
My doctor had me try 2 or 3 other similar medications before this one with the same results.
When I told him that I was still getting the muscle pains occasionally a couple weeks after I stopped taking it he said I was crazy.
I'm now afraid to take any of the Cholesterol drugs.
Every one that I've tried has had some really bad side effects.
