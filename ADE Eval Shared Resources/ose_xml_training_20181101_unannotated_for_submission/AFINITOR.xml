  6.1     Clinical Study Experience in Advanced Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Breast Cancer

  The efficacy and safety of AFINITOR (10 mg/day) plus exemestane (25 mg/day) (n=485) versus placebo plus exemestane (25 mg/day) (n=239) was evaluated in a randomized, controlled trial (BOLERO-2) in patients with advanced or metastatic hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. The median age of patients was 61 years (range 28-93 years), and 75% were Caucasian. Safety results are based on a median follow-up of approximately 13 months.

 The most common adverse reactions (incidence &gt;=30%) were stomatitis, infections, rash, fatigue, diarrhea, and decreased appetite. The most common Grade 3/4 adverse reactions (incidence &gt;=2%) were stomatitis, infections, hyperglycemia, fatigue, dyspnea, pneumonitis, and diarrhea. The most common laboratory abnormalities (incidence &gt;=50%) were hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, increased aspartate transaminase (AST), anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, increased alanine transaminase (ALT), and hypertriglyceridemia. The most common Grade 3/4 laboratory abnormalities (incidence &gt;= 3%) were lymphopenia, hyperglycemia, anemia, decreased potassium, increased AST, increased ALT, and thrombocytopenia.

 Fatal adverse reactions occurred more frequently in patients who received AFINITOR plus exemestane (2%) compared to patients on the placebo plus exemestane arm (0.4%). The rates of treatment-emergent adverse events resulting in permanent discontinuation were 24% and 5% for the AFINITOR plus exemestane and placebo plus exemestane treatment groups, respectively. Dose adjustments (interruptions or reductions) were more frequent among patients in the AFINITOR plus exemestane arm than in the placebo plus exemestane arm (63% versus 14%).

 Table 2 compares the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse reactions reported with an incidence of &gt;=10% for patients receiving AFINITOR 10 mg daily versus placebo.

 In a single arm study (SWISH; N=92) in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer beginning AFINITOR (10 mg/day) plus exemestane (25 mg/day), patients started dexamethasone 0.5mg/5mL alcohol-free mouthwash (10 mL swished for 2 minutes and spat, 4 times daily for 8 weeks) concurrently with AFINITOR and exemestane. No food or drink was to be consumed for at least 1 hour after swishing and spitting the dexamethasone mouthwash. The primary objective of this study was to assess the incidence of Grade &gt;= 2 stomatitis within 8 weeks. The incidence of Grade &gt;= 2 stomatitis within 8 weeks was 2%, which was lower than the 33% reported in the BOLERO-2 trial. The incidence of Grade 1 stomatitis was 19%. No cases of Grade 3 or 4 stomatitis were reported. Oral candidiasis was reported in 2% of patients in this study compared to 0.2% in the BOLERO-2 trial.

   6.2     Clinical Study Experience in Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors

    Advanced Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors (PNET)  

 In a randomized, controlled trial (RADIANT-3) of AFINITOR (n=204) versus placebo (n=203) in patients with advanced PNET the median age of patients was 58 years (range 20-87), 79% were White, and 55% were male. Patients on the placebo arm could cross over to open-label AFINITOR upon disease progression.

 The most common adverse reactions (incidence &gt;= 30%) were stomatitis, rash, diarrhea, fatigue, edema, abdominal pain, nausea, fever, and headache. The most common Grade 3-4 adverse reactions (incidence &gt;= 5%) were stomatitis and diarrhea. The most common laboratory abnormalities (incidence &gt;= 50%) were decreased hemoglobin, hyperglycemia, alkaline phosphatase increased, hypercholesterolemia, bicarbonate decreased, and increased aspartate transaminase (AST). The most common Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities (incidence &gt;= 3%) were hyperglycemia, lymphopenia, decreased hemoglobin, hypophosphatemia, increased alkaline phosphatase, neutropenia, increased aspartate transaminase (AST), potassium decreased, and thrombocytopenia.  Deaths during double-blind treatment where an adverse event was the primary cause occurred in seven patients on AFINITOR and one patient on placebo. Causes of death on the AFINITOR arm included one case of each of the following: acute renal failure, acute respiratory distress, cardiac arrest, death (cause unknown), hepatic failure, pneumonia, and sepsis. There was one death due to pulmonary embolism on the placebo arm. After cross-over to open-label AFINITOR, there were three additional deaths, one due to hypoglycemia and cardiac arrest in a patient with insulinoma, one due to myocardial infarction with congestive heart failure, and the other due to sudden death. The rates of treatment-emergent adverse events resulting in permanent discontinuation were 20% and 6% for the AFINITOR and placebo treatment groups, respectively. Dose delay or reduction was necessary in 61% of everolimus patients and 29% of placebo patients. Grade 3-4 renal failure occurred in six patients in the everolimus arm and three patients in the placebo arm. Thrombotic events included five patients with pulmonary embolus in the everolimus arm and one in the placebo arm as well as three patients with thrombosis in the everolimus arm and two in the placebo arm.

 Table 4 compares the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse reactions reported with an incidence of &gt;=10% for patients receiving AFINITOR 10 mg daily versus placebo.

 In a randomized, controlled trial (RADIANT-4) of AFINITOR (n=202 treated) versus placebo (n=98 treated) in patients with advanced non-functional NET of GI or lung origin, the median age of patients was 63 years (range 22-86), 76% were White, and 53% were female. The median duration of exposure to AFINITOR was 9.3 months; 64% of patients were treated for &gt;= 6 months and 39% were treated for &gt;= 12 months. AFINITOR was discontinued for adverse reactions in 29% of patients, dose reduction or delay was required in 70% of AFINITOR-treated patients.

 Serious adverse reactions occurred in 42% of AFINITOR-treated patients and included 3 fatal events (cardiac failure, respiratory failure, and septic shock).

 Table 6 and Table 7 summarize the incidence of adverse reactions of AFINITOR occurring at an incidence of &gt;=10% and at &gt;=5% absolute incidence over placebo (all Grades) or &gt;=2% higher incidence over placebo (Grade 3 and 4).

               6.3     Clinical Study Experience in Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma
   The data described below reflect exposure to AFINITOR (n=274) and placebo (n=137) in a randomized, controlled trial (RECORD-1) in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who received prior treatment with sunitinib and/or sorafenib. The median age of patients was 61 years (range 27-85), 88% were Caucasian, and 78% were male. The median duration of blinded study treatment was 141 days (range 19-451 days) for patients receiving AFINITOR and 60 days (range 21-295 days) for those receiving placebo.

 The most common adverse reactions (incidence &gt;=30%) were stomatitis, infections, asthenia, fatigue, cough, and diarrhea. The most common Grade 3-4 adverse reactions (incidence &gt;=3%) were infections, dyspnea, fatigue, stomatitis, dehydration, pneumonitis, abdominal pain, and asthenia. The most common laboratory abnormalities (incidence &gt;=50%) were anemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia, lymphopenia, and increased creatinine. The most common Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities (incidence &gt;=3%) were lymphopenia, hyperglycemia, anemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypercholesterolemia. Deaths due to acute respiratory failure (0.7%), infection (0.7%), and acute renal failure (0.4%) were observed on the AFINITOR arm but none on the placebo arm. The rates of treatment-emergent adverse events (irrespective of causality) resulting in permanent discontinuation were 14% and 3% for the AFINITOR and placebo treatment groups, respectively. The most common adverse reactions (irrespective of causality) leading to treatment discontinuation were pneumonitis and dyspnea. Infections, stomatitis, and pneumonitis were the most common reasons for treatment delay or dose reduction. The most common medical interventions required during AFINITOR treatment were for infections, anemia, and stomatitis.

 Table 8 compares the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse reactions reported with an incidence of &gt;=10% for patients receiving AFINITOR 10 mg daily versus placebo. Within each MedDRA system organ class, the adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing frequency.

               6.4     Clinical Study Experience in Renal Angiomyolipoma with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex
   The data described below are based on a randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (EXIST-2) of AFINITOR in 118 patients with renal angiomyolipoma as a feature of TSC (n=113) or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis (n=5). The median age of patients was 31 years (range 18 to 61 years), 89% were Caucasian, and 34% were male. The median duration of blinded study treatment was 48 weeks (range 2 to 115 weeks) for patients receiving AFINITOR and 45 weeks (range 9 to 115 weeks) for those receiving placebo.

 The most common adverse reaction reported for AFINITOR (incidence &gt;=30%) was stomatitis. The most common Grade 3-4 adverse reactions (incidence &gt;=2%) were stomatitis and amenorrhea. The most common laboratory abnormalities (incidence &gt;=50%) were hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and anemia. The most common Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormality (incidence &gt;=3%) was hypophosphatemia.

 The rate of adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation was 3.8% in the AFINITOR-treated patients. Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in the AFINITOR arm were hypersensitivity/angioedema/bronchospasm, convulsion, and hypophosphatemia. Dose adjustments (interruptions or reductions) due to adverse reactions occurred in 52% of AFINITOR-treated patients. The most common adverse reaction leading to AFINITOR dose adjustment was stomatitis.

 Table 10 compares the incidence of adverse reactions reported with an incidence of &gt;=10% for patients receiving AFINITOR and occurring more frequently with AFINITOR than with placebo. Laboratory abnormalities are described separately in Table 11.

   6.5     Clinical Study Experience in Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex

  The data described below are based on a randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (EXIST-1) of AFINITOR in 117 patients with subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). The median age of patients was 9.5 years (range 0.8 to 26 years), 93% were Caucasian, and 57% were male. The median duration of blinded study treatment was 52 weeks (range 24 to 89 weeks) for patients receiving AFINITOR and 47 weeks (range 14 to 88 weeks) for those receiving placebo.

 The most common adverse reactions reported for AFINITOR (incidence &gt;= 30%) were stomatitis and respiratory tract infection. The most common Grade 3-4 adverse reactions (incidence &gt;=2%) were stomatitis, pyrexia, pneumonia, gastroenteritis, aggression, agitation, and amenorrhea. The most common key laboratory abnormalities (incidence &gt;=50%) were hypercholesterolemia and elevated partial thromboplastin time. The most common Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormality (incidence &gt;=3%) was neutropenia.

 There were no adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation. Dose adjustments (interruptions or reductions) due to adverse reactions occurred in 55% of AFINITOR-treated patients. The most common adverse reaction leading to AFINITOR dose adjustment was stomatitis.

 Table 12 compares the incidence of adverse reactions reported with an incidence of &gt;=10% for patients receiving AFINITOR and occurring more frequently with AFINITOR than with placebo. Laboratory abnormalities are described separately in Table 13.

   6.6     Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of AFINITOR. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: acute pancreatitis, cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, arterial thrombotic events, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, and cardiac failure with some cases reported with pulmonary hypertension (including pulmonary arterial hypertension) as a secondary event.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">   5     WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

   EXCERPT:    *  Non-infectious pneumonitis: Monitor for clinical symptoms or radiological changes; fatal cases have occurred. Manage by dose reduction or discontinuation until symptoms resolve, and consider use of corticosteroids. (  5.1  ) 
 *  Infections: Increased risk of infections, some fatal. Monitor for signs and symptoms, and treat promptly. (  5.2  ) 
 *  Angioedema: Patients taking concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema. (  5.3  ) 
 *  Stomatitis: Stomatitis, including mouth ulcers and oral mucositis, occurs in most patients treated with AFINITOR. Initiation of topical treatment with dexamethasone mouthwash when starting AFINITOR reduces the incidence and severity of stomatitis. (  5.4  ,  6.1  ) 
 *  Renal failure: Cases of renal failure (including acute renal failure), some with a fatal outcome, have been observed. (  5.5  ) 
 *  Impaired wound healing: Increased risk of wound-related complications. Monitor signs and symptoms. Exercise caution in the peri-surgical period. (  5.6  ) 
 *  Laboratory test alterations: Elevations of serum creatinine, urinary protein, blood glucose, and lipids may occur. Decreases in hemoglobin, neutrophils, and platelets may also occur. Monitor renal function, blood glucose, lipids, and hematologic parameters prior to treatment and periodically thereafter. (  5.8  ) 
 *  Vaccinations: Avoid live vaccines and close contact with those who have received live vaccines. (  5.11  ) 
 *  Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. (  5.12  ,  8.1  ,  8.3  ) 
    
 

   5.1     Non-infectious Pneumonitis

  Non-infectious pneumonitis is a class effect of rapamycin derivatives, including AFINITOR. Non-infectious pneumonitis was reported in up to 19% of patients treated with AFINITOR in clinical trials, some cases reported with pulmonary hypertension (including pulmonary arterial hypertension) as a secondary event. The incidence of Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) Grade 3 and 4 non-infectious pneumonitis was up to 4.0% and up to 0.2%, respectively [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5)]  . Fatal outcomes have been observed.

 Consider a diagnosis of non-infectious pneumonitis in patients presenting with non-specific respiratory signs and symptoms such as hypoxia, pleural effusion, cough, or dyspnea, and in whom infectious, neoplastic, and other causes have been excluded by means of appropriate investigations. Opportunistic infections such as pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Advise patients to report promptly any new or worsening respiratory symptoms.

 Patients who develop radiological changes suggestive of non-infectious pneumonitis and have few or no symptoms may continue AFINITOR therapy without dose alteration. Imaging appears to overestimate the incidence of clinical pneumonitis.

 If symptoms are moderate, consider interrupting therapy until symptoms improve. The use of corticosteroids may be indicated. AFINITOR may be reintroduced at a daily dose approximately 50% lower than the dose previously administered [see Table 1 in Dosage and Administration (2.2)]  .

 For cases of Grade 3 non-infectious pneumonitis, interrupt AFINITOR until resolution to less than or equal to Grade 1. AFINITOR may be re-introduced at a daily dose approximately 50% lower than the dose previously administered depending on the individual clinical circumstances [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]  . If toxicity recurs at Grade 3, consider discontinuation of AFINITOR. For cases of Grade 4 non-infectious pneumonitis, discontinue AFINITOR. Corticosteroids may be indicated until clinical symptoms resolve. For patients who require use of corticosteroids for treatment of non-infectious pneumonitis, prophylaxis for PJP may be considered. The development of pneumonitis has been reported even at a reduced dose.

    5.2     Infections

  AFINITOR has immunosuppressive properties and may predispose patients to bacterial, fungal, viral, or protozoal infections, including infections with opportunistic pathogens [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5)]  . Localized and systemic infections, including pneumonia, mycobacterial infections, other bacterial infections, invasive fungal infections, such as aspergillosis, candidiasis, or pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) and viral infections including reactivation of hepatitis B virus have occurred in patients taking AFINITOR. Some of these infections have been severe (e.g., leading to sepsis, respiratory or hepatic failure) or fatal. Physicians and patients should be aware of the increased risk of infection with AFINITOR. Complete treatment of pre-existing invasive fungal infections prior to starting treatment with AFINITOR. While taking AFINITOR, be vigilant for signs and symptoms of infection; if a diagnosis of an infection is made, institute appropriate treatment promptly and consider interruption or discontinuation of AFINITOR. If a diagnosis of invasive systemic fungal infection is made, discontinue AFINITOR and treat with appropriate antifungal therapy.

 Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, some with a fatal outcome, has been reported in patients who received everolimus. This may be associated with concomitant use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents. Prophylaxis for PJP should be considered when concomitant use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents are required.

    5.3     Angioedema with Concomitant Use of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors

  Patients taking concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema (e.g., swelling of the airways or tongue, with or without respiratory impairment). In a pooled analysis of randomized double-blind oncology clinical trials, the incidence of angioedema in patients taking everolimus with an ACE inhibitor was 6.8% compared to 1.3% in the control arm with an ACE inhibitor.

    5.4     Stomatitis

   Stomatitis, including mouth ulcers and oral mucositis, has occurred in patients treated with AFINITOR at an incidence ranging from 44%-78% across the clinical trial experience. Grade 3 or 4 stomatitis was reported in 4%-9% of patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5)  ]. Stomatitis most often occurs within the first 8 weeks of treatment. When starting AFINITOR, initiating dexamethasone alcohol-free oral solution as a swish and spit mouthwash reduces the incidence and severity of stomatitis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]  . If stomatitis does occur, mouthwashes and/or other topical treatments are recommended, but alcohol-, hydrogen peroxide-, iodine-, or thyme- containing products should be avoided as they may exacerbate the condition [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]  . Antifungal agents should not be used unless fungal infection has been diagnosed [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]  .  

    5.5     Renal Failure

  Cases of renal failure (including acute renal failure), some with a fatal outcome, have been observed in patients treated with AFINITOR [see Laboratory Tests and Monitoring (5.8)]  .

    5.6     Impaired Wound Healing

  Everolimus delays wound healing and increases the occurrence of wound-related complications like wound dehiscence, wound infection, incisional hernia, lymphocele, and seroma. These wound-related complications may require surgical intervention. Exercise caution with the use of AFINITOR in the peri-surgical period.

    5.7     Geriatric Patients

  In the randomized advanced hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer study (BOLERO-2), the incidence of deaths due to any cause within 28 days of the last AFINITOR dose was 6% in patients &gt;= 65 years of age compared to 2% in patients &lt; 65 years of age. Adverse reactions leading to permanent treatment discontinuation occurred in 33% of patients &gt;= 65 years of age compared to 17% in patients &lt; 65 years of age. Careful monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments for adverse reactions are recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]  .

    5.8     Laboratory Tests and Monitoring

   Renal Function  

 Elevations of serum creatinine and proteinuria have been reported in patients taking AFINITOR [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5)]  . Monitoring of renal function, including measurement of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), urinary protein, or serum creatinine, is recommended prior to the start of AFINITOR therapy and periodically thereafter. Renal function of patients should be monitored particularly where patients have additional risk factors that may further impair renal function.

  Blood Glucose and Lipids  

 Hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and hypertriglyceridemia have been reported in patients taking AFINITOR [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5)]  . Monitoring of fasting serum glucose and lipid profile is recommended prior to the start of AFINITOR therapy and periodically thereafter as well as management with appropriate medical therapy. More frequent monitoring is recommended when AFINITOR is co-administered with other drugs that may induce hyperglycemia. When possible, optimal glucose and lipid control should be achieved before starting a patient on AFINITOR.

  Hematologic Parameters  

 Decreased hemoglobin, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and platelets have been reported in patients taking AFINITOR [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5)]  . Monitoring of complete blood count is recommended prior to the start of AFINITOR therapy and periodically thereafter.

    5.9     Drug-Drug Interactions

  Due to significant increases in exposure of everolimus, co-administration with strong CYP3A4/PgP inhibitors should be avoided  [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.5) and Drug Interactions (7.1)]  .

 A reduction of the AFINITOR dose is recommended when co-administered with a moderate CYP3A4/PgP inhibitor [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.5) and Drug Interactions (7.1)]  .

 An increase in the AFINITOR dose is recommended when co-administered with a strong CYP3A4/PgP inducer [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.5) and Drug Interactions (7.2)]  .

    5.10     Hepatic Impairment

  Exposure to everolimus was increased in patients with hepatic impairment  [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]  .

 For advanced HR+ BC, advanced NET, advanced RCC, and renal angiomyolipoma with TSC patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C), AFINITOR may be used at a reduced dose if the desired benefit outweighs the risk. For patients with mild (Child-Pugh class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh class B) hepatic impairment, a dose reduction is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]  .

 For patients with SEGA and mild or moderate hepatic impairment, adjust the dose of AFINITOR Tablets or AFINITOR DISPERZ based on therapeutic drug monitoring. For patients with SEGA and severe hepatic impairment, reduce the starting dose of AFINITOR Tablets or AFINITOR DISPERZ by approximately 50% and adjust subsequent doses based on therapeutic drug monitoring [see Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.5)]  .

    5.11     Vaccinations

  During AFINITOR treatment, avoid the use of live vaccines and avoid close contact with individuals who have received live vaccines (e.g., intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, yellow fever, varicella, and TY21a typhoid vaccines).

 For pediatric patients with SEGA that do not require immediate treatment, complete the recommended childhood series of live virus vaccinations according to American Council on Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidelines prior to the start of therapy. An accelerated vaccination schedule may be appropriate.

    5.12     Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

   Based on animal studies and the mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]  , AFINITOR can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal studies, everolimus caused embryo-fetal toxicities in rats when administered during the period of organogenesis at maternal exposures that were lower than human exposures at the clinical dose of 10 mg daily. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.  

  Advise female patients of reproductive potential to avoid becoming pregnant and to use effective contraception during treatment with AFINITOR and for 8 weeks after the last dose. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with AFINITOR and for 4 weeks after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]  .
