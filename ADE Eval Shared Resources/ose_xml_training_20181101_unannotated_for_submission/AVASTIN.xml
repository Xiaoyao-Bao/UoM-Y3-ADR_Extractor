  6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

  Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

 The most common adverse reactions observed in patients receiving Avastin as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy at a rate &gt; 10%, are epistaxis, headache, hypertension, rhinitis, proteinuria, taste alteration, dry skin, rectal hemorrhage, lacrimation disorder, back pain and exfoliative dermatitis.

 The safety data below reflect exposure to Avastin in 2919 patients with mCRC, non-squamous NSCLC, glioblastoma, mRCC, cervical cancer, platinum-resistant or platinum-sensitive recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, including controlled studies (AVF2107g, E3200, E4599, EORTC 26101, BO17705, GOG-0240, MO22224, AVF4095, GOG-0213) at the recommended dose and schedule for a median of 6 to 23 doses.

 Across clinical studies, Avastin was discontinued in 8% to 22% of patients because of adverse reactions  [see  Clinical Studies (14)  ].  

     Platinum  -  Resistant Recurrent Epithelia Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer  

 The safety of Avastin was evaluated in 179 patients who received at least one dose of Avastin in a multicenter, open-label study (MO22224) in which patients were randomized (1:1) to Avastin with chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone in patients with platinum resistant, recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer that recurred within &lt; 6 months from the most recent platinum based therapy. Patients were randomized to receive Avastin (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks). Patients had received no more than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens. The trial excluded patients with evidence of recto-sigmoid involvement by pelvic examination or bowel involvement on CT scan or clinical symptoms of bowel obstruction. Patients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Forty percent of patients on the chemotherapy alone arm received Avastin alone upon progression. The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population. Adverse reactions are presented in  Table 2  .

     Platinum-Sensitive Recurrent Epithelial Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer  

 The safety of Avastin was evaluated in 247 patients who received at least one dose of Avastin in a double-blind study (AVF4095g) in patients with platinum sensitive recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive Avastin (15 mg/kg) or placebo every 3 weeks with carboplatin and gemcitabine for 6 to 10 cycles followed by Avastin or placebo alone until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population. Adverse reactions are presented in  Table 3  .

     Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (mRCC)  

 The safety of Avastin was evaluated in 337 patients who received at least one dose of Avastin in a multicenter, double-blind study (BO17705) in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Patients who had undergone a nephrectomy were randomized (1:1) to receive either Avastin (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks) or placebo with interferon alfa. Patients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population.

 Grade 3-5 adverse reactions occurring at a higher incidence ( &gt;2%) were fatigue (13% vs. 8%), asthenia (10% vs. 7%), proteinuria (7% vs. 0%), hypertension (6% vs. 1%; including hypertension and hypertensive crisis), and hemorrhage (3% vs. 0.3%; including epistaxis, small intestinal hemorrhage, aneurysm ruptured, gastric ulcer hemorrhage, gingival bleeding, hemoptysis, hemorrhage intracranial, large intestinal hemorrhage, respiratory tract hemorrhage, and traumatic hematoma). Adverse reactions are presented in  Table 5  .

     Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (mCRC)  

 The safety of Avastin was evaluated in 392 patients who received at least one dose of Avastin in a double-blind, active-controlled study (AVF2107g), which compared Avastin (5 mg/kg every 2 weeks) with bolus-IFL to placebo with bolus IFL in patients with mCRC. Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to placebo with bolus IFL, Avastin with bolus IFL, or Avastin with 5 fluorouracil and leucovorin. The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population.

 All Grade 3-4 adverse reactions and selected Grade 1-2 adverse reactions (i.e., hypertension, proteinuria, thromboembolic events) were collected in the entire study population. Adverse reactions are presented in  Table 7  .

         The safety of Avastin was evaluated in 521 patients in an open-label, active-controlled study (E3200). Patients who were previously treated with irinotecan and fluorouracil for initial therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer. Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to FOLFOX4, Avastin (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks prior to FOLFOX4 on Day 1) with FOLFOX4, or Avastin alone (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks). Avastin was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
 

 The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population. The most frequent adverse reactions (selected Grade 3-5 non-hematologic and Grade 4-5 hematologic) occurring at a higher incidence (&gt;= 2%) in patients receiving Avastin with FOLFOX4 compared to FOLFOX4 alone were fatigue (19% vs. 13%), diarrhea (18% vs. 13%), sensory neuropathy (17% vs. 9%), nausea (12% vs. 5%), vomiting (11% vs. 4%), dehydration (10% vs. 5%), hypertension (9% vs. 2%), abdominal pain (8% vs. 5%), hemorrhage (5% vs. 1%), other neurological (5% vs. 3%), ileus (4% vs. 1%) and headache (3% vs. 0%). These data are likely to under-estimate the true adverse event rates due to the reporting mechanisms.

     First-Line Non Squamous Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)  

 The safety of Avastin was evaluated as first-line treatment in 422 patients with unresectable NSCLC who received at least one dose of Avastin in an active-controlled, open-label, multicenter trial (E4599). Chemotherapy naive patients with locally advanced, metastatic or recurrent non-squamous NSCLC were randomized (1:1) to receive six 21 day cycles of paclitaxel and carboplatin with or without Avastin (15 mg/kg every 3 weeks). After completion or upon discontinuation of chemotherapy, patients randomized to receive Avastin continued to receive Avastin alone until disease progression or until unacceptable toxicity. The trial excluded patients with predominant squamous histology (mixed cell type tumors only), CNS metastasis, gross hemoptysis (1/2 teaspoon or more of red blood), unstable angina, or receiving therapeutic anticoagulation. The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population.

 Only Grade 3-5 non hematologic and Grade 4-5 hematologic adverse reactions were collected. Grade 3-5 non hematologic and Grade 4-5 hematologic adverse reactions occurring at a higher incidence (&gt;= 2%) in patients receiving Avastin with paclitaxel and carboplatin compared with patients receiving chemotherapy alone were neutropenia (27% vs. 17%), fatigue (16% vs. 13%), hypertension (8% vs. 0.7%), infection without neutropenia (7% vs. 3%), venous thromboembolism (5% vs. 3%), febrile neutropenia (5% vs. 2%), pneumonitis/pulmonary infiltrates (5% vs. 3%), infection with Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (4% vs. 2%), hyponatremia (4% vs. 1%), headache (3% vs. 1%) and proteinuria (3% vs. 0%).

     Recurrent Glioblastoma  

 EORTC 26101 was a multicenter, randomized, open-label study in patients with recurrent GBM following radiotherapy and temozolomide of whom 278 patients received at least one dose of Avastin and are considered safety evaluable. Patients were randomized (2:1) to receive Avastin (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks) with lomustine or lomustine alone until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population. In the Avastin with lomustine arm, 22% of patients discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions compared with 10% of patients in the lomustine arm. In patients receiving Avastin with lomustine, the adverse reaction profile was similar to that observed in other approved indications.

   6.2 Immunogenicity

  As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to bevacizumab in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading.

 In clinical studies for adjuvant treatment of a solid tumor, 0.6% (14/2323) of patients tested positive for treatment-emergent anti-bevacizumab antibodies as detected by an electrochemiluminescent (ECL) based assay. Among these 14 patients, three tested positive for neutralizing antibodies against bevacizumab using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The clinical significance of these anti-bevacizumab antibodies is not known.

   6.3 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Avastin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

   Body as a Whole:  Polyserositis  Cardiovascular:  Pulmonary hypertension, Mesenteric venous occlusion  Gastrointestinal:  Gastrointestinal ulcer, Intestinal necrosis, Anastomotic ulceration  Hemic and lymphatic:  Pancytopenia  Hepatobiliary disorders:  Gallbladder perforation  Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders:  Osteonecrosis of the jaw  Renal:  Renal thrombotic microangiopathy (manifested as severe proteinuria)  Respiratory:  Nasal septum perforation

   5.1 Gastrointestinal Perforations and Fistulae

  Serious and sometimes fatal gastrointestinal perforation occur at a higher incidence in patients receiving Avastin compared to patients receiving chemotherapy. The incidence ranged from 0.3% to 3% across clinical studies, with the highest incidence in patients with a history of prior pelvic radiation. Perforation can be complicated by intra-abdominal abscess, fistula formation, and the need for diverting ostomies. The majority of perforations occurred within 50 days of the first dose.

 Serious fistulae (including, tracheoesophageal, bronchopleural, biliary, vaginal, renal and bladder sites) occur at a higher incidence in patients receiving Avastin compared to patients receiving chemotherapy. The incidence ranged from &lt; 1% to 1.8% across clinical studies, with the highest incidence in patients with cervical cancer. The majority of fistulae occurred within 6 months of the first dose. Patients who develop a gastrointestinal vaginal fistula may also have a bowel obstruction and require surgical intervention, as well as a diverting ostomy.

 Avoid Avastin in patients with ovarian cancer who have evidence of recto-sigmoid involvement by pelvic examination or bowel involvement on CT scan or clinical symptoms of bowel obstruction. Discontinue in patients who develop gastrointestinal perforation, tracheoesophageal fistula or any Grade 4 fistula. Discontinue in patients with fistula formation involving any internal organ [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  

    5.2 Surgery and Wound Healing Complications

  In a controlled clinical study in which Avastin was not administered within 28 days of major surgical procedures, the incidence of wound healing complications, including serious and fatal complications, was 15% in patients with mCRC who underwent surgery while receiving Avastin and 4% in patients who did not receive Avastin. In a controlled clinical study in patients with relapsed or recurrent GBM, the incidence of wound healing events was 5% in patients who received Avastin and 0.7% in patients who did not receive Avastin [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  

 Discontinue Avastin in patients with wound healing complications requiring medical intervention. Withhold for at least 28 days prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 28 days following surgery and until the wound is fully healed.

 Necrotizing fasciitis including fatal cases, has been reported in patients receiving Avastin, usually secondary to wound healing complications, gastrointestinal perforation or fistula formation. Discontinue in patients who develop necrotizing fasciitis [see  Adverse Reactions (6.3)  ].  

    5.3 Hemorrhage

  Avastin can result in two distinct patterns of bleeding: minor hemorrhage, most commonly Grade 1 epistaxis; and serious, and in some cases fatal, hemorrhage. Severe or fatal hemorrhage, including hemoptysis, gastrointestinal bleeding, hematemesis, CNS hemorrhage, epistaxis, and vaginal bleeding, occurred up to 5-fold more frequently in patients receiving Avastin compared to patients receiving chemotherapy alone. Across clinical studies, the incidence of Grades 3-5 hemorrhagic events ranged from 0.4% to 7% in patients receiving Avastin [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  

 Serious or fatal pulmonary hemorrhage occurred in 31% of patients with squamous NSCLC and 4% of patients with non-squamous NSCLC receiving Avastin with chemotherapy compared to none of the patients receiving chemotherapy alone.

 Do not administer Avastin to patients with recent history of hemoptysis of 1/2 teaspoon or more of red blood. Discontinue in patients who develop a Grade 3-4 hemorrhage.

    5.4 Arterial Thromboembolic Events

  Serious, sometimes fatal, arterial thromboembolic events (ATE) including cerebral infarction, transient ischemic attacks, myocardial infarction, and angina, occurred at a higher incidence in patients receiving Avastin compared to patients receiving chemotherapy. Across clinical studies, the incidence of Grades 3-5 ATE was 5% in patients receiving Avastin with chemotherapy compared to &lt;= 2% in patients receiving chemotherapy alone; the highest incidence occurred in patients with GBM. The risk of developing ATE was increased in patients with a history of arterial thromboembolism, diabetes, or greater than 65 years old [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.5)  ].  

 Discontinue in patients who develop a severe ATE. The safety of reinitiating Avastin after an ATE is resolved is not known.

    5.5 Venous Thromboembolic Events

  An increased risk of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) was observed across clinical studies. In Study GOG-0240, Grade 3-4 VTE was reported in 11% of patients receiving Avastin with chemotherapy compared with 5% of patients receiving chemotherapy alone. In EORTC 26101, the incidence of Grade 3-4 VTE was 5% in patients receiving Avastin with chemotherapy compared to 2% in patients receiving chemotherapy alone.

 Discontinue Avastin in patients with a Grade 4 VTE, including pulmonary embolism [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  

    5.6 Hypertension

  The incidence of severe hypertension is increased in patients receiving Avastin as compared to patients receiving chemotherapy alone. Across clinical studies, the incidence of Grade 3-4 hypertension ranged from 5% to 18%.

 Monitor blood pressure every two to three weeks during treatment with Avastin. Treat with appropriate anti-hypertensive therapy and monitor blood pressure regularly. Continue to monitor blood pressure at regular intervals in patients with Avastin-induced or -exacerbated hypertension after discontinuing Avastin. Withhold Avastin in patients with severe hypertension that is not controlled with medical management; resume once controlled with medical management. Discontinue in patients who develop hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy.

    5.7 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES)

  PRES was reported in &lt; 0.5% of patients across clinical studies. The onset of symptoms occurred from 16 hours to 1 year after the first dose. PRES is a neurological disorder which can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, confusion, blindness and other visual and neurologic disturbances. Mild to severe hypertension may be present. Magnetic resonance imaging is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of PRES.

 Discontinue Avastin in patients who develop PRES. Symptoms usually resolve or improve within days after discontinuing Avastin, although some patients have experienced ongoing neurologic sequelae. The safety of reinitiating Avastin in patients who developed PRES is not known.

    5.8 Renal Injury and Proteinuria

  The incidence and severity of proteinuria is higher in patients receiving Avastin as compared to patients receiving chemotherapy. Grade 3 (defined as urine dipstick 4+ or &gt; 3.5 grams of protein per 24 hours) to Grade 4 (defined as nephrotic syndrome) ranged from 0.7% to 7% in clinical studies. The overall incidence of proteinuria (all grades) was only adequately assessed in Study BO17705, in which the incidence was 20%. Median onset of proteinuria was 5.6 months (15 days to 37 months) after initiating Avastin. Median time to resolution was 6.1 months (95% CI: 2.8, 11.3). Proteinuria did not resolve in 40% of patients after median follow-up of 11.2 months and required discontinuation of Avastin in 30% of the patients who developed proteinuria.

 In an exploratory, pooled analysis of patients from seven randomized clinical studies, 5% of patients receiving Avastin with chemotherapy experienced Grades 2-4 (defined as urine dipstick 2+ or greater or &gt; 1 gram of protein per 24 hours or nephrotic syndrome) proteinuria. Grades 2-4 proteinuria resolved in 74% of patients. Avastin was reinitiated in 42% of patients. Of the 113 patients who reinitiated Avastin, 48% experienced a second episode of Grade 2-4 proteinuria.

 Nephrotic syndrome occurred in &lt; 1% of patients receiving Avastin across clinical studies, in some instances with fatal outcome. In a published case series, kidney biopsy of 6 patients with proteinuria showed findings consistent with thrombotic microangiopathy. Results of a retrospective analysis of 5805 patients who received Avastin with chemotherapy and 3713 patients who received chemotherapy alone, showed higher rates of elevated serum creatinine levels (between 1.5 to 1.9 times baseline levels) in patients who received Avastin. Serum creatinine levels did not return to baseline in approximately one-third of patients who received Avastin.

 Monitor proteinuria by dipstick urine analysis for the development or worsening of proteinuria with serial urinalyses during Avastin therapy. Patients with a 2+ or greater urine dipstick reading should undergo further assessment with a 24-hour urine collection. Withhold for proteinuria greater than or equal to 2 grams per 24 hours and resume when less than 2 grams per 24 hours. Discontinue in patients who develop nephrotic syndrome.

 Data from a postmarketing safety study showed poor correlation between UPCR (Urine Protein/Creatinine Ratio) and 24-hour urine protein [Pearson Correlation 0.39 (95% CI: 0.17, 0.57)] .  

    5.9 Infusion Reactions

  Infusion reactions reported across clinical studies and post-marketing experience include hypertension, hypertensive crises associated with neurologic signs and symptoms, wheezing, oxygen desaturation, Grade 3 hypersensitivity, chest pain, headaches, rigors, and diaphoresis. In clinical studies, infusion reactions with the first dose occurred in &lt; 3% of patients and severe reactions occurred in 0.2% of patients.

 Decrease the rate of infusion for mild, clinically insignificant infusion reactions. Interrupt the infusion in patients with clinically significant infusion reactions and consider resuming at a slower rate following resolution. Discontinue in patients who develop a severe infusion reaction and administer appropriate medical therapy (e.g., epinephrine, corticosteroids, intravenous antihistamines, bronchodilators and/or oxygen).

    5.10 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

  Avastin may cause fetal harm based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies. Congenital malformations were observed with the administration of bevacizumab to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis every 3 days at a dose as low as a clinical dose of 10 mg/kg. Furthermore, animal models link angiogenesis and VEGF and VEGFR 2 to critical aspects of female reproduction, embryo-fetal development, and postnatal development. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with and for 6 months after the last dose of Avastin [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1  ,  8.3)  ,  Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)  ].  

    5.11 Ovarian Failure

  The incidence of ovarian failure was 34% vs. 2% in premenopausal women receiving Avastin with chemotherapy as compared to those receiving chemotherapy alone for adjuvant treatment of a solid tumor. After discontinuing Avastin, recovery of ovarian function at all time points during the post-treatment period was demonstrated in 22% of women receiving Avastin. Recovery of ovarian function is defined as resumption of menses, a positive serum beta-HCG pregnancy test, or a FSH level &lt; 30 mIU/mL during the post-treatment period. Long-term effects of Avastin on fertility are unknown. Inform females of reproductive potential of the risk of ovarian failure prior to initiating Avastin [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ,  Use in Specific Populations (8.3)  ].  

    5.12 Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)

   Avastin is not indicated for use with anthracycline-based chemotherapy. The incidence of Grade &gt;= 3 left ventricular dysfunction was 1% in patients receiving Avastin compared to 0.6% of patients receiving chemotherapy alone. Among patients who received prior anthracycline treatment, the rate of CHF was 4% for patients receiving Avastin with chemotherapy as compared to 0.6% for patients receiving chemotherapy alone.  

  In previously untreated patients with a hematological malignancy, the incidence of CHF and decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were increased in patients receiving Avastin with anthracycline-based chemotherapy compared to patients receiving placebo with the same chemotherapy regimen. The proportion of patients with a decline in LVEF from baseline of &gt;= 20% or a decline from baseline of 10% to &lt; 50%, was 10% in patients receiving Avastin with chemotherapy compared to 5% in patients receiving chemotherapy alone. Time to onset of left-ventricular dysfunction or CHF was 1 to 6 months after the first dose in at least 85% of the patients and was resolved in 62% of the patients who developed CHF in the Avastin arm compared to 82% in the placebo arm. Discontinue Avastin in patients who develop CHF.
