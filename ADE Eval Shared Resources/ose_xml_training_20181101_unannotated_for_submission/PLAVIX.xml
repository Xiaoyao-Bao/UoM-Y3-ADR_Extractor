  The following serious adverse reactions are discussed below and elsewhere in the labeling:

 *  Bleeding [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]  
 *  Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.4)  ]  
      EXCERPT:   Bleeding, including life-threatening and fatal bleeding, is the most commonly reported adverse reaction. (  6.1  )

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions and durations of follow-up, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

 Plavix has been evaluated for safety in more than 54,000 patients, including over 21,000 patients treated for one year or more. The clinically important adverse reactions observed in trials comparing Plavix plus aspirin to placebo plus aspirin and trials comparing Plavix alone to aspirin alone are discussed below.

     Bleeding  

   CURE

 In CURE, Plavix use with aspirin was associated with an increase in major bleeding (primarily gastrointestinal and at puncture sites) compared to placebo with aspirin (see  Table 1  ). The incidence of intracranial hemorrhage (0.1%) and fatal bleeding (0.2%) were the same in both groups. Other bleeding events that were reported more frequently in the clopidogrel group were epistaxis, hematuria, and bruise.

 The overall incidence of bleeding is described in Table 1.

           COMMIT
 

 In COMMIT, similar rates of major bleeding were observed in the Plavix and placebo groups, both of which also received aspirin (see  Table 2  ).

            CAPRIE (Plavix vs Aspirin)
 

 In CAPRIE, gastrointestinal hemorrhage occurred at a rate of 2.0% in those taking Plavix versus 2.7% in those taking aspirin; bleeding requiring hospitalization occurred in 0.7% and 1.1%, respectively. The incidence of intracranial hemorrhage was 0.4% for Plavix compared to 0.5% for aspirin.

 Other bleeding events that were reported more frequently in the Plavix group were epistaxis and hematoma.

     Other Adverse Events  

 In CURE and CHARISMA, which compared Plavix plus aspirin to aspirin alone, there was no difference in the rate of adverse events (other than bleeding) between Plavix and placebo.

 In CAPRIE, which compared Plavix to aspirin, pruritus was more frequently reported in those taking Plavix. No other difference in the rate of adverse events (other than bleeding) was reported.

   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Plavix. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of an unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

 Hemorrhages, including those with fatal outcome, have been reported in patients treated with Plavix.

 *   Blood and lymphatic system disorders : Agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia/pancytopenia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), acquired hemophilia A

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: DIMINISHED ANTIPLATELET EFFECT IN PATIENTS WITH TWO LOSS-OF-FUNCTION ALLELES OF THE CYP2C19 GENE

  WARNING: DIMINISHED ANTIPLATELET EFFECT IN PATIENTS WITH TWO LOSS-OF-FUNCTION ALLELES OF THE CYP2C19 GENE

  EXCERPT:   WARNING:  DIMINISHED ANTIPLATELET EFFECT IN PATIENTS WITH TWO LOSS-OF-FUNCTION ALLELES OF THE CYP2C19 GENE

   See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.  

 *  Effectiveness of Plavix depends on conversion to an active metabolite by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system, principally CYP2C19. (5.1, 12.3) 
 *  Tests are available to identify patients who are CYP2C19 poor metabolizers. (12.5) 
 *  Consider use of another platelet P2Y12 inhibitor in patients identified as CYP2C19 poor metabolizers. (5.1) 
    
 

    The effectiveness of Plavix results from its antiplatelet activity, which is dependent on its conversion to an active metabolite by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system, principally CYP2C19   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ,   Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  .  Plavix at recommended doses forms less of  the active metabolite and so has a reduced effect on platelet activity in patients who are homozygous for nonfunctional alleles of the CYP2C19 gene, (termed "CYP2C19 poor metabolizers").  Tests are available to identify patients who are CYP2C19 poor metabolizers   [see   Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)  ]  .  Consider use of another platelet P2Y12 inhibitor in patients identified as CYP2C19 poor metabolizers.  

</Section>
    <Section id="S3" name="warnings and precautions">   5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

   EXCERPT:    *  CYP2C19 inhibitors: Avoid concomitant use of omeprazole or esomeprazole. (  5.1  ) 
 *  Bleeding: Plavix increases risk of bleeding. (  5.2  ) 
 *  Discontinuation: Premature discontinuation increases risk of cardiovascular events. Discontinue 5 days prior to elective surgery that has a major risk of bleeding. (  5.3  ) 
 *  Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) has been reported. (  5.4  ) 
 *  Cross-reactivity among thienopyridines has been reported. (  5.5  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Diminished Antiplatelet Activity in Patients with Impaired CYP2C19 Function

  Clopidogrel is a prodrug. Inhibition of platelet aggregation by clopidogrel is achieved through an active metabolite. The metabolism of clopidogrel to its active metabolite can be impaired by genetic variations in CYP2C19 [see  Boxed Warning  ].  

 The metabolism of clopidogrel can also be impaired by drugs that inhibit CYP2C19, such as omeprazole or esomeprazole. Avoid concomitant use of Plavix with omeprazole or esomeprazole because both significantly reduce the antiplatelet activity of Plavix [see  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ]  .

    5.2 General Risk of Bleeding

  Thienopyridines, including Plavix, increase the risk of bleeding.

 Thienopyridines inhibit platelet aggregation for the lifetime of the platelet (7-10 days). Because the half-life of clopidogrel's active metabolite is short, it may be possible to restore hemostasis by administering exogenous platelets; however, platelet transfusions within 4 hours of the loading dose or 2 hours of the maintenance dose may be less effective.

    5.3 Discontinuation of Plavix

  Discontinuation of Plavix increases the risk of cardiovascular events. If Plavix must be temporarily discontinued (e.g., to treat bleeding or for surgery with a major risk of bleeding), restart it as soon as possible. When possible, interrupt therapy with Plavix for five days prior to such surgery. Resume Plavix as soon as hemostasis is achieved.

    5.4 Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP)

  TTP, sometimes fatal, has been reported following use of Plavix, sometimes after a short exposure (&lt;2 weeks). TTP is a serious condition that requires urgent treatment including plasmapheresis (plasma exchange). It is characterized by thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (schistocytes [fragmented RBCs] seen on peripheral smear), neurological findings, renal dysfunction, and fever [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ].  

    5.5 Cross-Reactivity among Thienopyridines

  Hypersensitivity including rash, angioedema or hematologic reaction has been reported in patients receiving Plavix, including patients with a history of hypersensitivity or hematologic reaction to other thienopyridines [see  Contraindications (4.2)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ]  .
