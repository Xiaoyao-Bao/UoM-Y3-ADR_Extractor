  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience with Intravenous Administration

  The data described below reflect exposure to BENLYSTA administered intravenously plus standard therapy compared with placebo plus standard therapy in 2,133 patients in 3 controlled trials. Patients received BENLYSTA plus standard therapy at doses of 1 mg/kg (n = 673), 4 mg/kg (n = 111; Trial 1 only), or 10 mg/kg (n = 674), or placebo plus standard therapy (n = 675) intravenously over a 1-hour period on Days 0, 14, 28, and then every 28 days. In 2 of the trials (Trial 1 and Trial 3), treatment was given for 48 weeks, while in the other trial (Trial 2) treatment was given for 72 weeks  [see Clinical Studies (  14.1  )]  . Because there was no apparent dose-related increase in the majority of adverse events observed with BENLYSTA, the safety data summarized below are presented for the 3 intravenous doses pooled, unless otherwise indicated; the adverse reaction table displays the results for the recommended intravenous dose of 10 mg/kg compared with placebo.

 The population had a mean age of 39 years (range: 18 to 75), 94% were female, and 52% were white. In these trials, 93% of patients treated with BENLYSTA plus standard therapy reported an adverse event compared with 92% treated with placebo plus standard therapy.

 The most common serious adverse events were serious infections (6.0% and 5.2% in the groups receiving BENLYSTA and placebo plus standard therapy, respectively), some of which were fatal  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )]  .

 The most commonly reported adverse events, occurring in &gt;=5% of patients in clinical trials were nausea, diarrhea, pyrexia, nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, insomnia, pain in extremity, depression, migraine, and pharyngitis.

 The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to any adverse reaction during the controlled clinical trials was 6.2% for patients receiving BENLYSTA plus standard therapy and 7.1% for patients receiving placebo plus standard therapy. The most common adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of treatment (&gt;=1% of patients receiving BENLYSTA or placebo) were infusion reactions (1.6% BENLYSTA and 0.9% placebo), lupus nephritis (0.7% BENLYSTA and 1.2% placebo), and infections (0.7% BENLYSTA and 1.0% placebo).

   Table 1  lists adverse reactions, regardless of causality, occurring in at least 3% of patients with SLE who received BENLYSTA 10 mg/kg plus standard therapy and at an incidence at least 1% greater than that observed with placebo plus standard therapy in the 3 controlled studies.

           6.2 Clinical Trials Experience with Subcutaneous Administration
   The data described below reflect exposure to BENLYSTA administered subcutaneously plus standard therapy compared with placebo plus standard therapy in 836 patients in a controlled trial (Trial 4). In addition to standard therapy, patients received BENLYSTA 200 mg (n = 556) or placebo (n = 280) (2:1 randomization) once weekly for up to 52 weeks  [see Clinical Studies (  14.2  )]  .

 The overall population had a mean age of 39 years (range: 18 to 77), 94% were female, and 60% were white. In the trial, 81% of patients treated with BENLYSTA plus standard therapy reported an adverse event compared with 84% treated with placebo plus standard therapy. The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to any adverse reaction during the controlled clinical trial was 7.2% of patients receiving BENLYSTA plus standard therapy and 8.9% of patients receiving placebo plus standard therapy.

 The safety profile observed for BENLYSTA administered subcutaneously plus standard therapy was consistent with the known safety profile of BENLYSTA administered intravenously plus standard therapy, with the exception of local injection site reactions.

   Injection Site Reactions  

 In the clinical study for BENLYSTA administered subcutaneously, the frequency of injection site reactions was 6.1% (34/556) for patients receiving BENLYSTA plus standard therapy and 2.5% (7/280) for patients receiving placebo plus standard therapy. These injection site reactions (most commonly pain, erythema, hematoma, pruritus, and induration) were mild to moderate in severity. The majority (94%) did not necessitate discontinuation of treatment.

   6.3 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of BENLYSTA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

 *    Fatal anaphylaxis [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  )] . 
      6.4 Immunogenicity
   As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to belimumab with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading.

 In Trials 2 and 3 (intravenous dosing), anti-belimumab antibodies were detected in 4 of 563 (0.7%) patients receiving BENLYSTA 10 mg/kg and in 27 of 559 (4.8%) patients receiving BENLYSTA 1 mg/kg. The reported frequency for the group receiving 10 mg/kg may underestimate the actual frequency due to lower assay sensitivity in the presence of high drug concentrations. Neutralizing antibodies were detected in 3 patients receiving BENLYSTA 1 mg/kg. Three patients with anti-belimumab antibodies experienced mild infusion reactions of nausea, erythematous rash, pruritus, eyelid edema, headache, and dyspnea; none of the reactions was life-threatening. In Trial 4 (subcutaneous dosing), there was no formation of anti-belimumab antibodies in 556 patients receiving BENLYSTA 200 mg during the 52-week placebo-controlled period. The clinical relevance of the presence of anti-belimumab antibodies is not known.

 The data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were positive for antibodies to belimumab in specific assays.

   5.1 Mortality

  There were more deaths reported with BENLYSTA than with placebo during the controlled period of the intravenous clinical trials. Out of 2,133 patients in 3 clinical trials, a total of 14 deaths occurred during the placebo-controlled, double-blind treatment periods: 3/675 (0.4%), 5/673 (0.7%), 0/111 (0%), and 6/674 (0.9%) deaths in the groups receiving placebo, BENLYSTA 1 mg/kg, BENLYSTA 4 mg/kg, and BENLYSTA 10 mg/kg, respectively. No single cause of death predominated. Etiologies included infection, cardiovascular disease, and suicide.

  In the controlled trial of BENLYSTA administered subcutaneously (N = 836), a total of 5 deaths occurred during the placebo-controlled, double-blind treatment period (0.7% [2/280] of patients receiving placebo and 0.5% [3/556] of patients receiving BENLYSTA). Infection was the most common cause of death.  

    5.2 Serious Infections

  Serious and sometimes fatal infections have been reported in patients receiving immunosuppressive agents, including BENLYSTA. Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use of BENLYSTA in patients with severe or chronic infections. Consider interrupting therapy with BENLYSTA in patients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with BENLYSTA and monitor these patients closely.

 In the controlled clinical trials of BENLYSTA administered intravenously, the overall incidence of infections was 71% in patients treated with BENLYSTA compared with 67% in patients who received placebo. The most frequent infections (&gt;5% of patients receiving BENLYSTA) were upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, nasopharyngitis, sinusitis, bronchitis, and influenza. Serious infections occurred in 6.0% of patients treated with BENLYSTA and in 5.2% of patients who received placebo. The most frequent serious infections included pneumonia, urinary tract infection, cellulitis, and bronchitis. Infections leading to discontinuation of treatment occurred in 0.7% of patients receiving BENLYSTA and 1.0% of patients receiving placebo. Infections resulting in death occurred in 0.3% (4/1,458) of patients treated with BENLYSTA and in 0.1% (1/675) of patients receiving placebo.

  In the controlled trial of BENLYSTA administered subcutaneously (N = 836), the overall incidence of infections was 55% in patients treated with BENLYSTA compared with 57% in patients who received placebo (serious infections: 4.1% with BENLYSTA and 5.4% with placebo). The most commonly reported infections with BENLYSTA administered subcutaneously were similar to those reported with BENLYSTA administered intravenously.  

  Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)  

 Cases of JC virus-associated PML resulting in neurological deficits, including fatal cases, have been reported in patients with SLE receiving immunosuppressants, including BENLYSTA. Risk factors for PML include treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. Consider the diagnosis of PML in any patient presenting with new-onset or deteriorating neurological signs and symptoms and consult with a neurologist or other appropriate specialist as clinically indicated. In patients with confirmed PML, consider stopping immunosuppressant therapy, including BENLYSTA.

    5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions, including Anaphylaxis

  Acute hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and death, have been reported in association with BENLYSTA. These events generally occurred within hours of the infusion; however, they may occur later. Non-acute hypersensitivity reactions including rash, nausea, fatigue, myalgia, headache, and facial edema, have been reported and typically occurred up to a week following the most recent infusion. Hypersensitivity, including serious reactions, has occurred in patients who have previously tolerated infusions of BENLYSTA. Limited data suggest that patients with a history of multiple drug allergies or significant hypersensitivity may be at increased risk.

 In the controlled clinical trials of BENLYSTA administered intravenously, hypersensitivity reactions (occurring on the same day of infusion) were reported in 13% (191/1,458) of patients receiving BENLYSTA and 11% (76/675) of patients receiving placebo. Anaphylaxis was observed in 0.6% (9/1,458) of patients receiving BENLYSTA and 0.4% (3/675) of patients receiving placebo. Manifestations included hypotension, angioedema, urticaria or other rash, pruritus, and dyspnea. Due to overlap in signs and symptoms, it was not possible to distinguish between hypersensitivity reactions and infusion reactions in all cases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]  . Some patients (13%) received premedication, which may have mitigated or masked a hypersensitivity response; however, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether premedication diminishes the frequency or severity of hypersensitivity reactions.

 BENLYSTA for intravenous use should be administered by healthcare providers prepared to manage anaphylaxis. In the event of a serious reaction, administration of BENLYSTA must be discontinued immediately and appropriate medical therapy administered. Patients should be monitored during and for an appropriate period of time after intravenous administration of BENLYSTA.

  In the controlled trial of BENLYSTA administered subcutaneously (N = 836), systemic hypersensitivity reactions were similar to those observed in the intravenous clinical trials.  

 Patients receiving BENLYSTA should be informed of the signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions and be instructed to seek immediate medical care should a reaction occur.

    5.4 Infusion Reactions

  In the controlled clinical trials of BENLYSTA administered intravenously, adverse events associated with the infusion (occurring on the same day of the infusion) were reported in 17% (251/1,458) of patients receiving BENLYSTA and 15% (99/675) of patients receiving placebo. Serious infusion reactions (excluding hypersensitivity reactions) were reported in 0.5% of patients receiving BENLYSTA and 0.4% of patients receiving placebo and included bradycardia, myalgia, headache, rash, urticaria, and hypotension. The most common infusion reactions (&gt;=3% of patients receiving BENLYSTA) were headache, nausea, and skin reactions. Due to overlap in signs and symptoms, it was not possible to distinguish between hypersensitivity reactions and infusion reactions in all cases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]  . Some patients (13%) received premedication, which may have mitigated or masked an infusion reaction; however, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether premedication diminishes the frequency or severity of infusion reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]  .

 BENLYSTA for intravenous use should be administered by healthcare providers prepared to manage infusion reactions. The infusion rate may be slowed or interrupted if the patient develops an infusion reaction. Healthcare providers should be aware of the risk of hypersensitivity reactions, which may present as infusion reactions, and monitor patients closely.

    5.5 Depression

  In the controlled clinical trials of BENLYSTA administered intravenously, psychiatric events were reported more frequently with BENLYSTA (16%) than with placebo (12%), related primarily to depression-related events (6.3% BENLYSTA and 4.7% placebo), insomnia (6.0% BENLYSTA and 5.3% placebo), and anxiety (3.9% BENLYSTA and 2.8% placebo). Serious psychiatric events were reported in 0.8% of patients receiving BENLYSTA (0.6% and 1.2% with 1 and 10 mg/kg, respectively) and 0.4% of patients receiving placebo. Serious depression was reported in 0.4% (6/1,458) of patients receiving BENLYSTA and 0.1% (1/675) of patients receiving placebo. Two suicides (0.1%) were reported in patients receiving BENLYSTA.

  In the controlled trial of BENLYSTA administered subcutaneously (N = 836), psychiatric events were reported in 6% of patients treated with BENLYSTA and in 11% of patients who received placebo. Depression-related events were reported in 2.7% of patients receiving BENLYSTA and 3.6% of patients receiving placebo. Serious psychiatric events were reported in 0.2% of patients receiving BENLYSTA and in no patients receiving placebo. There were no serious depression-related events or suicides reported in either group.  

 The majority of patients who reported serious depression or suicidal behavior had a history of depression or other serious psychiatric disorders and most were receiving psychoactive medications. It is unknown if treatment with BENLYSTA is associated with increased risk for these events.

 Patients receiving BENLYSTA should be instructed to contact their healthcare provider if they experience new or worsening depression, suicidal thoughts, or other mood changes.

    5.6 Malignancy

  The impact of treatment with BENLYSTA on the development of malignancies is not known.

  In the controlled clinical trials of BENLYSTA administered intravenously, malignancies (including non-melanoma skin cancers) were reported in 0.4% of patients receiving BENLYSTA and 0.4% of patients receiving placebo. In the intravenous controlled clinical trials, malignancies, excluding non-melanoma skin cancers, were observed in 0.2% (3/1,458) and 0.3% (2/675) of patients receiving BENLYSTA and placebo, respectively. In the controlled clinical trial of BENLYSTA administered subcutaneously (N = 836), the data were similar. The mechanism of action of BENLYSTA could increase the risk for the development of malignancies.  

    5.7 Immunization

  Live vaccines should not be given for 30 days before or concurrently with BENLYSTA as clinical safety has not been established. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection from persons receiving live vaccines to patients receiving BENLYSTA or the effect of BENLYSTA on new immunizations. Because of its mechanism of action, BENLYSTA may interfere with the response to immunizations.

    5.8 Concomitant Use with Other Biologic Therapies or Intravenous Cyclophosphamide

  BENLYSTA has not been studied in combination with other biologic therapies, including B-cell targeted therapies, or intravenous cyclophosphamide. Therefore, use of BENLYSTA is not recommended in combination with biologic therapies or intravenous cyclophosphamide.
