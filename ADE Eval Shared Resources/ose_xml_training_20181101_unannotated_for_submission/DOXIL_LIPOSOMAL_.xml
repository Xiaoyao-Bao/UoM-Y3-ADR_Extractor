  6.1 Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed cannot be directly compared to rates on other clinical trials and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

 The safety data reflect exposure to DOXIL in 1310 patients including: 239 patients with ovarian cancer, 753 patients with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma, and 318 patients with multiple myeloma.

 The following tables present adverse reactions from clinical trials of single-agent DOXIL in ovarian cancer and AIDS-Related Kaposi's sarcoma.

   Patients With Ovarian Cancer

 The safety data described below are from Trial 4, which included 239 patients with ovarian cancer treated with DOXIL 50 mg/m  2  once every 4 weeks for a minimum of four courses in a randomized, multicenter, open-label study. In this trial, patients received DOXIL for a median number of 3.2 months (range 1 day to 25.8 months). The median age of the patients is 60 years (range 27 to 87), with 91% Caucasian, 6% Black, and 3% Hispanic or Other.

 Table 3 presents the hematologic adverse reactions from Trial 4.

   Patients With AIDS-Related Kaposi's Sarcoma

 The safety data described is based on the experience reported in 753 patients with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) enrolled in four open-label, uncontrolled trials of DOXIL administered at doses ranging from 10 to 40 mg/m  2  every 2 to 3 weeks. Demographics of the population were: median age 38.7 years (range 24-70); 99% male; 88% Caucasian, 6% Hispanic, 4% Black, and 2% Asian/other/unknown. The majority of patients were treated with 20 mg/m  2  of DOXIL every 2 to 3 weeks with a median exposure of 4.2 months (range 1 day to 26.6 months). The median cumulative dose was 120 mg/m  2  (range 3.3 to 798.6 mg/m  2  ); 3% received cumulative doses of greater than 450 mg/m  2  .

 Disease characteristics were: 61% poor risk for KS tumor burden, 91% poor risk for immune system, and 47% poor risk for systemic illness; 36% were poor risk for all three categories; median CD4 count 21 cells/mm  3  (51% less than 50 cells/mm  3  ); mean absolute neutrophil count at study entry approximately 3,000 cells/mm  3  .

 Of the 693 patients with concomitant medication information, 59% were on one or more antiretroviral medications [35% zidovudine (AZT), 21% didanosine (ddI), 16% zalcitabine (ddC), and 10% stavudine (D4T)]; 85% received PCP prophylaxis (54% sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim); 85% received antifungal medications (76% fluconazole); 72% received antivirals (56% acyclovir, 29% ganciclovir, and 16% foscarnet) and 48% patients received colony-stimulating factors (sargramostim/filgrastim) during their course of treatment.

 Adverse reactions led to discontinuation of treatment in 5% of patients with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma and included myelosuppression, cardiac adverse reactions, infusion-related reactions, toxoplasmosis, HFS, pneumonia, cough/dyspnea, fatigue, optic neuritis, progression of a non-KS tumor, allergy to penicillin, and unspecified reasons. Tables 5 and 6 summarize adverse reactions reported in patients treated with DOXIL for AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma in a pooled analysis of the four trials.

   Patients With Multiple Myeloma

 The safety data described are from 318 patients treated with DOXIL (30 mg/m  2  ) administered on day 4 following bortezomib (1.3 mg/m  2  i.v. bolus on days 1, 4, 8 and 11) every 3 weeks, in a randomized, open-label, multicenter study (Trial 6). In this trial, patients in the DOXIL + bortezomib combination group were treated for a median number of 4.5 months (range 21 days to 13.5 months). The population was 28 to 85 years of age (median age 61), 58% male, 90% Caucasian, 6% Black, and 4% Asian and Other. Table 7 lists adverse reactions reported in 10% or more of patients treated with DOXIL in combination with bortezomib for multiple myeloma.

             6.2 Postmarketing Experience
   The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of DOXIL. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

   Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders:  muscle spasms

   Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders:  pulmonary embolism (in some cases fatal)

   Hematologic disorders  : Secondary acute myelogenous leukemia

   Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:  erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis

   Secondary oral neoplasms: [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.4)  ].

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: CARDIOMYOPATHY and INFUSION-RELATED REACTIONS

    WARNING: CARDIOMYOPATHY and INFUSION-RELATED REACTIONS  

    *  DOXIL (doxorubicin HCl liposome injection) can cause myocardial damage, including congestive heart failure, as the total cumulative dose of doxorubicin HCl approaches 550 mg/m2. In a clinical study of 250 patients with advanced cancer who were treated with DOXIL, the risk of cardiotoxicity was 11% when the cumulative anthracycline dose was between 450-550 mg/m2. Prior use of other anthracyclines or anthracenediones should be included in calculations of total cumulative dosage. The risk of cardiomyopathy may be increased at lower cumulative doses in patients with prior mediastinal irradiation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 
 *  Acute infusion-related reactions consisting of, but not limited to, flushing, shortness of breath, facial swelling, headache, chills, back pain, tightness in the chest or throat, and/or hypotension occurred in 11% of patients with solid tumors treated with DOXIL. Serious, life-threatening and fatal infusion reactions have been reported [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings and precautions">   5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

   EXCERPT:    *  Hand-Foot Syndrome may occur. Dose modification or discontinuation may be required (  5.3  ) 
 *  Embryofetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise of potential risk to a fetus. Use effective contraception (  5.5  ,  8.1  ,  8.3  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Cardiomyopathy

  Doxorubicin HCl can result in myocardial damage, including acute left ventricular failure. The risk of cardiomyopathy with doxorubicin HCl is generally proportional to the cumulative exposure. The relationship between cumulative DOXIL dose and the risk of cardiac toxicity has not been determined.

 In a clinical study in 250 patients with advanced cancer who were treated with DOXIL, the risk of cardiotoxicity was 11% when the cumulative anthracycline dose was between 450-550 mg/m  2  . Cardiotoxicity was defined as &gt;20% decrease in resting left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) from baseline where LVEF remained in the normal range or a &gt;10% decrease in LVEF from baseline where LVEF was less than the institutional lower limit of normal. Two percent of patients developed signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure without documented evidence of cardiotoxicity.

 Assess left ventricular cardiac function (e.g. MUGA or echocardiogram) prior to initiation of DOXIL, during treatment to detect acute changes, and after treatment to detect delayed cardiotoxicity. Administer DOXIL to patients with a history of cardiovascular disease only when the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk.

    5.2 Infusion-Related Reactions

  Serious and sometimes life-threatening infusion-related reactions characterized by one or more of the following symptoms can occur with DOXIL: flushing, shortness of breath, facial swelling, headache, chills, chest pain, back pain, tightness in the chest and throat, fever, tachycardia, pruritus, rash, cyanosis, syncope, bronchospasm, asthma, apnea, and hypotension. The majority of infusion-related events occurred during the first infusion. Of 239 patients with ovarian cancer treated with DOXIL in Trial 4, 7% of patients experienced acute infusion-related reactions resulting in dose interruption. All occurred during cycle 1 and none during subsequent cycles. Across multiple studies of DOXIL monotherapy including this and other studies enrolling 760 patients with various solid tumors, 11% of patients had infusion-related reactions.

 Ensure that medications to treat infusion-related reactions and cardiopulmonary resuscitative equipment are available for immediate use prior to initiation of DOXIL. Initiate DOXIL infusions at a rate of 1 mg/min and increase rate as tolerated [see  Dosage and Administration (2.6)  ]  . In the event of an infusion-related reaction, temporarily stop the drug until resolution then resume at a reduced infusion rate. Discontinue DOXIL infusion for serious or life-threatening infusion-related reactions.

    5.3 Hand-Foot Syndrome (HFS)

  In Trial 4, the incidence of HFS was 51% of patients in the DOXIL arm and 0.9% of patients in the topotecan arm, including 24% Grade 3 or 4 cases of HFS in DOXIL-treated patients and no Grade 3 or 4 cases in topotecan-treated patients. HFS or other skin toxicity required discontinuation of DOXIL in 4.2% of patients.

 HFS was generally observed after 2 or 3 cycles of treatment but may occur earlier. Delay DOXIL for the first episode of Grade 2 or greater HFS [see  Dosage and Administration (2.5)  ]  . Discontinue DOXIL if HFS is severe and debilitating.

    5.4 Secondary Oral Neoplasms

  Secondary oral cancers, primarily squamous cell carcinoma, have been reported from post-marketing experience in patients with long-term (more than one year) exposure to DOXIL. These malignancies were diagnosed both during treatment with DOXIL and up to 6 years after the last dose. Examine patients at regular intervals for the presence of oral ulceration or with any oral discomfort that may be indicative of secondary oral cancer.

 The altered pharmacokinetics and preferential tissue distribution of liposomal doxorubicin that contributes to enhanced skin toxicity and mucositis compared to free doxorubicin may play a role in the development of oral secondary malignancies with long-term use.

    5.5 Embryofetal Toxicity

  Based on animal data, DOXIL can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. At doses approximately 0.12 times the recommended clinical dose, DOXIL was embryotoxic and abortifacient in rabbits. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females and males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and for 6 months after treatment with DOXIL [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  and  (8.3)  ]  .
