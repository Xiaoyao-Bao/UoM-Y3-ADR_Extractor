    <h1>TAC Submission Convertor</h1>
    <p>If you participated in the <a
        href="https://bionlp.nlm.nih.gov/tac2017adversereactions/">NIST
        TAC 2017 Adverse Drug Reaction track</a>, you can use this
      utility, under some circumstances, to convert your TAC submission
      to OSE submission format, to use as a baseline. <br>
    </p>
    <p>The reason that this convertor only works in some circumstances
      is that the TAC submission format does not directly link mentions
      to MedDRA codes, and the various intervening steps can add a good
      deal of uncertainty to the process. This convertor will work if
      your submission has the following properties:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> It contains material which responds to all four TAC tasks;</li>
      <li>Its set of reaction strings is exactly those predicted by the
        Task 3 rules for computing positive ADRs (in strict mode;
        non-strict mode only generates warnings).</li>
      <li>All reaction strings must be MedDRA coded.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <pre>$ python scripts/convert_tac_to_ose.py --help<br>usage: convert_tac_to_ose.py [-h] [--strict] [--medascii_dir MEDASCII_DIR] tac_xml_dir ose_gold_xml_dir ose_submission_output_xml_dir<br><br>positional arguments:<br>  tac_xml_dir           TAC submission directory of XML files in TAC format<br>  ose_gold_xml_dir      OSE gold standard directory of XML files in OSE gold standard format<br>  ose_submission_output_xml_dir<br>                        output directory where converted XML files in OSE submission format will be placed (directory will be created if<br>                        necessary<br><br>optional arguments:<br>  -h, --help            show this help message and exit<br>  --strict              If present, TAC format reader will fail rather than warn for certain inconsistencies<br>  --medascii_dir MEDASCII_DIR<br>                        the MedAscii directory of your MedDRA 20.1 data distribution. When provided, the corpus reader will perform MedDRA<br>                        wellformedness checking.<br></pre>
    The tool refers to a gold standard OSE corpus in ose_gold_xml_dir to
    find those labels in the intersection of your TAC submission and the
    gold set. There should be fifty of these, since the OSE training
    corpus we distribute to you contains fifty labels which are
    identical in text and name to labels in the TAC test set. <br>
    <p>Because of a bug in the preparation of the TAC test set, some of
      the labels contain duplicates of the label sections. The convertor
      will identify and discard these duplicates, and you'll see
      warnings such as the following:<br>
    </p>
    <pre>WARNING: for ICLUSIG: discarding section 'boxed warnings' (S4) due to NLM duplication (kept first)<br></pre>
    <p>There are also a number of labels in the TAC submission which
      have the same name as labels in the OSE corpus, but the bodies of
      the two labels differ. These are spurious label name matches which
      will also generate warnings and will be discarded.<br>
    </p>
    <p>If you specify the MedAscii 20.1 directory, you will definitely
      get MedDRA warnings. This is due to the differences between MedDRA
      18, which is the version used in the ADR evaluation, and MedDRA
      20.1, which is the version we use for ours.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>Let's say your TAC submission is in /proj/nist_tac/submission1,
      and your gold OSE documents are in /proj/ade_eval/training_gold,
      and you want to place the converted submission in
      /proj/ade_eval/translated_tac_submission1:<br>
    </p>
    <pre>python scripts/convert_tac_to_ose.py /proj/nist_tac/submission1 /proj/ade_eval/training_gold /proj/ade_eval/translated_tac_submission1
