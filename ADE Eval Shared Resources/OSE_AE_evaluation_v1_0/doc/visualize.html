    <h1>Visualizer</h1>
    <p>The data for this evaluation is quite complicated; there are
      discontinuous mentions and a good deal of overlap among mentions.
      To better visualize the data, we provide this visualization tool,
      which exploits the <a href="http://brat.nlplab.org/index.html">brat

        annotation tool</a>.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <pre>$ python scripts/visualize.py <br>Usage: visualize.py [ 'ose_gold' | 'ose_submission' ] ose_corpus brat_installation outdir<br></pre>
    <p>The ose_corpus is a directory of OSE documents in either gold or
      submission format, as specified on the command line. The
      brat_installation is an installation of version 1.3 of brat (code
      name Crunchy Frog).<br>
    </p>
    <p>When you run this utility, the outdir will be populated with a
      set of HTML files, one for each section of each document in the
      ose_corpus directory. The outdir will also contain Javascript
      utilities which leverage portions of brat to display the mentions.
      You may load any of the HTML files into your favorite
      standards-compliant browser (Firefox is known to work). Once the
      document is loaded, if you hover your mouse over a given
      annotation, its description, including its MedDRA code(s), will
      appear at the bottom of your browser window.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>Let's say want to visualize the gold standard corpus. Let's say
      you've downloaded brat and unzipped it, and the toplevel brat
      directory is /proj/ade_eval/brat-v1.3_Crunchy_Frog. Further, let's
      assume your gold standard documents are in
      /proj/ade_eval/training_gold, and that you want to place the HTML
      files in /proj/ade_eval/training_gold_viz:<br>
    </p>
    <pre>$ python scripts/visualize.py ose_gold /proj/ade_eval/training_gold /proj/ade_eval/brat-v1.3_Crunchy_Frog /proj/ade_eval/training_gold_viz<br></pre>
  </body>
