  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 In two clinical trials, 791 subjects were treated with KERYDIN. The most commonly reported adverse reactions are listed below (  Table 1  ).

   Preferred Term                                          KERYDINN=791    n(%)      VehicleN=395    n(%)     
 Application site exfoliation                            21 (2.7%)               1 (0.3%)                 
 Ingrown toenail                                         20 (2.5%)               1 (0.3%)                 
 Application site erythema                               13 (1.6%)               0 (0%)                   
 Application site dermatitis                             10 (1.3%)               0 (0%)                   
         A cumulative irritancy study revealed the potential for KERYDIN to cause skin irritation. There was no evidence that KERYDIN causes contact sensitization.
