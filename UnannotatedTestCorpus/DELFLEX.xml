    <Section id="S1" name="adverse reactions">      Adverse Reactions  

  Adverse reactions occurring with administration of peritoneal dialysis include mechanical and solution related problems as well as the results of contamination of equipment or improper technique in catheter placement. Abdominal pain, bleeding, peritonitis, subcutaneous infection around a peritoneal catheter, catheter blockage, difficulty in fluid removal, and ileus are among the complications of the procedure. Solution related adverse reactions might include peritonitis, catheter site infection, electrolyte and fluid imbalances, hypovolemia, hypervolemia, hypertension, hypotension, disequilibrium syndrome and muscle cramping.



 If an adverse reaction does occur, institute appropriate therapeutic procedures according to the patient's needs and conditions, and save the remainder of the fluid in the bag for evaluation if deemed necessary.

   General



  Chronic patients that have been stabilized on peritoneal dialysis therapy should have routine evaluation of electrolyte blood chemistries and hematologic factors measured in order to determine the patient's ongoing condition.



 DELFLEX  (r)  peritoneal dialysis solutions do not include potassium. Potassium chloride should only be added under the direction of a physician after careful evaluation of both serum and total body potassium.



 Significant loss of protein, amino acids and water soluble vitamins may occur during peritoneal dialysis. Replacement therapy should be provided as necessary.



    Information for Patients



  Aseptic technique must be used throughout the procedure and at its termination in order to reduce the possibility of infection.



 The outerwrap should remain intact until time of use.



 Administer only if the solution is clear, all seals are intact, and there is no evidence of leaking.



 Do Not Heat In A Microwave Oven. Microwave ovens heat unevenly and can leave hot spots, which can burn the peritoneum.



 It is important to mix the buffer (Mini-Bag) and main solutions thoroughly. Administer within 24 hours after mixing. Once solutions are mixed, other prescribed medication(s) may be added prior to administration.



 Disconnect from disc only when knob is in position 4 (∙∙∙∙) to ensure patient connector is sealed.



 Care should be taken to ensure that there is not any leakage around the catheter, since if not controlled; the leakage can create edema from subcutaneous infiltration of the dialysis solution. This will also create an inaccurate fluid balance measurement. If any leakage is identified do not proceed with infusion and notify your physician.



    Laboratory Tests



  Serum electrolytes, magnesium, bicarbonate levels and fluid balance should be periodically monitored.



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility



  Long term animal studies with DELFLEX  (r)  peritoneal dialysis solutions have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential or effect on fertility.



    Pregnancy: Teratology Effects



  Pregnancy Category C. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with DELFLEX  (r)  peritoneal dialysis solutions. It is also not known whether DELFLEX  (r)  peritoneal dialysis solutions can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. DELFLEX  (r)  peritoneal dialysis solutions should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.



    Nursing Mothers



  Caution should be exercised when DELFLEX  (r)  peritoneal dialysis solutions are administered to a nursing woman.



    Pediatric Use



  Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.

  Not for Intravenous Injection.



 Use Aseptic Technique.



 It is important to mix the buffer (Mini-Bag) and main solutions thoroughly. Administer within 24 hours after mixing. Once solutions are mixed, other prescribed medication(s) may be added prior to administration.



 After removing the outerwrap, check for minute leaks by squeezing each of the solution bags firmly. If leaks are found, discard the solution because the sterility may be impaired. (A small amount of moisture may be present inside the outerwrap, which is normal condensation from the sterilization process).



 Peritoneal dialysis should be done with great care, in patients with a number of conditions, including disruption of the peritoneal membrane or diaphragm by surgery or trauma, extensive adhesions, bowel distention, undiagnosed abdominal disease, abdominal wall infection, hernias or burns, fecal fistula or colostomy, tense ascites, obesity, large polycystic kidneys, recent aortic graft replacement, lactic acidosis and severe pulmonary disease. When assessing peritoneal dialysis as the mode of therapy in such extreme situations, the benefits to the patient must be weighed against the possible complications.



 Solutions containing lactate ion should be used with great care in patients with metabolic or respiratory alkalosis. Lactate should be administered with great care in those conditions in which there is an increased level or an impaired utilization of this ion, such as severe hepatic insufficiency.



 An accurate fluid balance record must be kept and the weight of the patient carefully monitored to avoid over or under hydration with severe consequences, including congestive heart failure, volume depletion and shock.



 Excessive use of DELFLEX  (r)  peritoneal dialysis solution with 4.25% dextrose during a peritoneal dialysis treatment can result in significant removal of water from the patient.



 Stable patients undergoing maintenance peritoneal dialysis should have routine periodic evaluation of blood chemistries and hematologic factors, as well as other indicators of patient status.



 Serum calcium levels in patients using low calcium concentrations should be monitored and if found to be low, the peritoneal solution in use should be altered to one with a higher calcium concentration.
