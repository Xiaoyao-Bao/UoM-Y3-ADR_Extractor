  6.1 Clinical Trial Experience with CLL/SLL

    MURANO  



 The safety of VENCLEXTA in combination with rituximab (VEN+R) versus bendamustine in combination with rituximab (B+R), was evaluated in an open-label randomized study, in patients with CLL who had received at least one prior therapy.



 Patients randomized to VEN+R completed the scheduled ramp-up (5 weeks) and received VENCLEXTA 400 mg once daily in combination with rituximab for 6 cycles followed by single agent VENCLEXTA for a total of 24 months after ramp-up. Patients randomized to B+R received 6 cycles (28 days per cycle) for a total of 6 months. Details of the study treatment are described in Section 14  [see Clinical Studies (  14.1  )]  .



 At the time of analysis, the median duration of exposure was 22 months in the VEN+R arm compared with 6 months in the B+R arm.



 In the VEN+R arm, fatal adverse reactions that occurred in the absence of disease progression and within 30 days of the last VENCLEXTA treatment and/or 90 days of last rituximab were reported in 2% (4/194) of patients. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 46% of patients in the VEN+R arm, with most frequent (&gt;=5%) being pneumonia (9%).



 In the VEN+R arm, adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation in 16% of patients, dose reduction in 15%, and dose interruption in 71%. In the B+R arm, adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation in 10% of patients, dose reduction in 15%, and dose interruption in 40%. In the VEN+R arm, neutropenia led to dose interruption of VENCLEXTA in 46% of patients and discontinuation in 3%, and thrombocytopenia led to discontinuation in 3% of patients.



   Table 9  and  Table 10  present adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, respectively, identified in the MURANO trial. The MURANO trial was not designed to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in adverse reaction rates for VEN+R as compared with B+R, for any specific adverse reaction or laboratory abnormality.

   Monotherapy Studies (M13-982, M14-032, and M12-175)  



 The safety of single agent VENCLEXTA at the 400 mg recommended daily dose following a dose ramp-up schedule is based on pooled data from three single-arm trials (M13-982, M14-032, and M12-175). In the pooled dataset, consisting of 352 patients with previously treated CLL or SLL, the median age was 66 years (range: 28 to 85 years), 93% were white, and 68% were male. The median number of prior therapies was 3 (range: 0 to 15). The median duration of treatment with VENCLEXTA at the time of data analysis was 14.5 months (range: 0 to 50 months). Fifty-two percent of patients received VENCLEXTA for more than 60 weeks.



 Fatal adverse reactions that occurred in the absence of disease progression and within 30 days of venetoclax treatment were reported in 2% of patients in the VENCLEXTA monotherapy studies, most commonly (2 patients) from septic shock. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 52% of patients, with the most frequent (&gt;=5%) being pneumonia (9%), febrile neutropenia (5%), and sepsis (5%).



 Adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation in 9% of patients, dose reduction in 13%, and dose interruption in 36%. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to drug discontinuation were thrombocytopenia and autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The most frequent adverse reaction (&gt;=5%) leading to dose reductions or interruptions was neutropenia (8%).



 Adverse reactions identified in these trials of single-agent VENCLEXTA are presented in  Table 11  .

        Important Adverse Reactions  
 

   Tumor Lysis Syndrome  



 Tumor lysis syndrome is an important identified risk when initiating VENCLEXTA.



     MURANO    



 In the open-label randomized phase 3 study, the incidence of TLS was 3% (6/194) in patients treated with VEN+R. After 77/389 patients were enrolled in the study, the protocol was amended to incorporate the current TLS prophylaxis and monitoring measures described in sections 2.1 and 2.2  [see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  ,  2.2  )]  . All events of TLS occurred during the VENCLEXTA ramp-up period and were resolved within two days. All six patients completed the ramp-up and reached the recommended daily dose of 400 mg of VENCLEXTA. No clinical TLS was observed in patients who followed the current 5-week ramp-up schedule and TLS prophylaxis and monitoring measures described in sections 2.1 and 2.2  [see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  ,  2.2  )]  . Rates of laboratory abnormalities relevant to TLS for patients treated with VEN+R are presented in  Table 10  .



     Monotherapy Studies (M13-982 and M14-032)    



 In 168 patients with CLL treated according to recommendations described in sections 2.1 and 2.2, the rate of TLS was 2%  [see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  ,  2.2  )]  . All events either met laboratory TLS criteria (laboratory abnormalities that met &gt;=2 of the following within 24 hours of each other: potassium &gt;6 mmol/L, uric acid &gt;476 umol/L, calcium &lt;1.75 mmol/L, or phosphorus &gt;1.5 mmol/L); or were reported as TLS events. The events occurred in patients who had a lymph node(s) &gt;=5 cm and/or ALC &gt;=25 x 10  9  /L. All events resolved within 5 days. No TLS with clinical consequences such as acute renal failure, cardiac arrhythmias or sudden death and/or seizures was observed in these patients. All patients had CLcr &gt;=50 mL/min. Laboratory abnormalities relevant to TLS were hyperkalemia (17% all Grades, 1% Grade &gt;=3), hyperphosphatemia (14% all Grades, 2% Grade &gt;=3), hypocalcemia (16% all Grades, 2% Grade &gt;=3), and hyperuricemia (10% all Grades, &lt;1% Grade &gt;=3).



 In the initial Phase 1 dose-finding trials, which had shorter (2-3 week) ramp-up phase and higher starting doses, the incidence of TLS was 13% (10/77; 5 laboratory TLS, 5 clinical TLS), including 2 fatal events and 3 events of acute renal failure, 1 requiring dialysis. After this experience, TLS risk assessment, dosing regimen, TLS prophylaxis and monitoring measures were revised  [see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  ,  2.2  )]  .



   6.2 Clinical Trial Experience with AML

  The safety of VENCLEXTA (400 mg daily dose) in combination with azacitidine (n=67) or decitabine (n= 13) and VENCLEXTA (600 mg daily dose) in combination with low-dose cytarabine (n= 61) is based on two non-randomized trials of patients with newly-diagnosed AML  [see Clinical Studies (  14.3  )]  . The median duration of exposure for patients taking VENCLEXTA in combination with azacitidine and decitabine was 6.5 months (range: 0.1 to 31.9 months) and 8.4 months (range: 0.5 to 22.3 months), respectively. The median duration of exposure for patients taking VENCLEXTA in combination with low dose cytarabine was 3.9 months (range: 0.2 to 29.2 months).

        Tumor Lysis Syndrome  
 

 Tumor lysis syndrome is an important risk when initiating treatment in patients with AML. The incidence of TLS was 3% (2/61) with VENCLEXTA in combination with low-dose cytarabine with implementation of dose ramp-up schedule in addition to standard prophylaxis and monitoring measures. All events were laboratory TLS, and all patients were able to reach the target dose.
</Section>
    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS): Anticipate TLS; assess risk in all patients. Premedicate with anti-hyperuricemics and ensure adequate hydration. Employ more intensive measures (intravenous hydration, frequent monitoring, hospitalization) as overall risk increases. (  2.2  ,  5.1  ) 
 *  Neutropenia: Monitor blood counts and for signs of infection; manage as medically appropriate. (  2.3  ,  5.2  ) 
 *  Immunization: Do not administer live attenuated vaccines prior to, during, or after VENCLEXTA treatment. (  5.3  ) 
 *  Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: May cause embryo-fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception during treatment.  (5.4)   
    
 

   5.1 Tumor Lysis Syndrome



  Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), including fatal events and renal failure requiring dialysis, has occurred in patients with high tumor burden when treated with VENCLEXTA [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  ,  6.2  )]  .



 In patients with CLL, the current (5 week) dose ramp-up, TLS prophylaxis and monitoring, the rate of TLS was 2% in the VENCLEXTA CLL monotherapy studies. The rate of TLS remained consistent with VENCLEXTA in combination with rituximab. With a 2 to 3 week dose ramp-up and higher starting dose in patients with CLL/SLL, the TLS rate was 13% and included deaths and renal failure [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  .



 VENCLEXTA can cause rapid reduction in tumor and thus poses a risk for TLS at initiation and during the ramp-up phase. Changes in blood chemistries consistent with TLS that require prompt management can occur as early as 6 to 8 hours following the first dose of VENCLEXTA and at each dose increase.



 The risk of TLS is a continuum based on multiple factors, including tumor burden and comorbidities. Reduced renal function further increases the risk. Patients should be assessed for risk and should receive appropriate prophylaxis for TLS, including hydration and anti-hyperuricemics. Monitor blood chemistries and manage abnormalities promptly. Interrupt dosing if needed. Employ more intensive measures (intravenous hydration, frequent monitoring, hospitalization) as overall risk increases [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  ,  2.3  ) and Use in Specific Populations (  8.6  )]  .



 Concomitant use of VENCLEXTA with P-gp inhibitors or strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors increases venetoclax exposure, may increase the risk of TLS at initiation and during ramp-up phase and requires VENCLEXTA dose adjustment [see Dosage and Administration (  2.4  ) and Drug Interactions (  7.1  )]  .



    5.2 Neutropenia



   In patients with CLL, Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia developed in 64% of patients and Grade 4 neutropenia developed in 31% of patients treated with VENCLEXTA in combination with rituximab (see  Table 10  ). Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia developed in 63% of patients and Grade 4 neutropenia developed in 33% of patients treated with VENCLEXTA monotherapy (see  Table 12  ). Febrile neutropenia occurred in 4% of patients treated with VENCLEXTA in combination with rituximab and in 6% of patients treated with VENCLEXTA monotherapy [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  .  



  Baseline neutrophil counts worsened in 97% to 100% of patients treated with VENCLEXTA in combination with azacitidine or decitabine or low-dose cytarabine. Neutropenia can recur with subsequent cycles of therapy.  



 Monitor complete blood counts throughout the treatment period. Interrupt dosing or reduce dose for severe neutropenia. Consider supportive measures including antimicrobials for signs of infection and use of growth factors (e.g., G-CSF) [see Dosage and Administration (  2.3  )]  .



    5.3 Immunization



  Do not administer live attenuated vaccines prior to, during, or after treatment with VENCLEXTA until B-cell recovery occurs. The safety and efficacy of immunization with live attenuated vaccines during or following VENCLEXTA therapy have not been studied. Advise patients that vaccinations may be less effective.



    5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, VENCLEXTA may cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In an embryo-fetal study conducted in mice, administration of venetoclax to pregnant animals at exposures equivalent to that observed in patients at the recommended dose of 400 mg daily resulted in post-implantation loss and decreased fetal weight. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women using VENCLEXTA. Advise females of reproductive potential to avoid pregnancy during treatment. If VENCLEXTA is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking VENCLEXTA, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations  (8.1)  ]  .
