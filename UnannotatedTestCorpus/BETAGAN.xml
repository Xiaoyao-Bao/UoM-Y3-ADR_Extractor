  In clinical trials the use of  BETAGAN    (r)  ophthalmic solution has been associated with transient ocular burning and stinging in up to 1 in 3 patients, and with blepharoconjunctivitis in up to 1 in 20 patients. Decreases in heart rate and blood pressure have been reported (see  CONTRAINDICATIONS  and  WARNINGS  ).



 The following adverse reactions have been reported rarely with the use of  BETAGAN    (r)  : iridocyclitis, headache, transient ataxia, dizziness, lethargy, urticaria, and pruritus.



 Decreased corneal sensitivity has been noted in a small number of patients. Although levobunolol has minimal membrane-stabilizing activity, there remains a possibility of decreased corneal sensitivity after prolonged use.



 The following additional adverse reactions have been reported either with  BETAGAN    (r)  ophthalmic solution or ophthalmic use of other beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents:



   BODY AS A WHOLE:  Headache, asthenia, chest pain.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Bradycardia, arrhythmia, hypotension, syncope, heart block, cerebral vascular accident, cerebral ischemia, congestive heart failure, palpitation, cardiac arrest.  DIGESTIVE:  Nausea, diarrhea.  PSYCHIATRIC:  Depression, confusion, increase in signs and symptoms of myasthenia gravis, paresthesia.  SKIN:  Hypersensitivity, including localized and generalized rash, alopecia, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome.  RESPIRATORY:  Bronchospasm (predominantly in patients with pre-existing bronchospastic disease), respiratory failure, dyspnea, nasal congestion.  UROGENITAL:  Impotence.  ENDOCRINE:  Masked symptoms of hypoglycemia in insulin-dependent diabetics (see  WARNINGS  ).  SPECIAL SENSES:  Signs and symptoms of keratitis or eye allergy, blepharoptosis, visual disturbances including refractive changes (due to withdrawal of miotic therapy in some cases), diplopia, ptosis, and foreign body sensation in eye. 



 Other reactions associated with the oral use of non-selective adrenergic receptor blocking agents should be considered potential effects with ophthalmic use of these agents.

    <Section id="S2" name="precautions">     PRECAUTIONS  



      General  



   BETAGAN    (r)  (levobunolol hydrochloride ophthalmic solution, USP) sterile should be used with caution in patients with known hypersensitivity to other beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents.



 Use with caution in patients with known diminished pulmonary function.



  BETAGAN    (r)  should be used with caution in patients who are receiving a beta-adrenergic blocking agent orally, because of the potential for additive effects on systemic beta-blockade or on intraocular pressure. Patients should not typically use two or more topical ophthalmic beta-adrenergic blocking agents simultaneously.



 Because of the potential effects of beta-adrenergic blocking agents on blood pressure and pulse rates, these medications must be used cautiously in patients with cerebrovascular insufficiency. Should signs or symptoms develop that suggest reduced cerebral blood flow while using BETAGAN    (r)  ophthalmic solution, alternative therapy should be considered.



 In patients with angle-closure glaucoma, the immediate objective of treatment is to reopen the angle. This requires, in most cases, constricting the pupil with a miotic. BETAGAN    (r)  ophthalmic solution has little or no effect on the pupil. When BETAGAN    (r)  is used to reduce elevated intraocular pressure in angle-closure glaucoma, it should be followed with a miotic and not alone.



 The preservative in BETAGAN    (r)  , benzalkonium chloride, may be absorbed by soft contact lenses. Patients wearing soft (hydrophilic) contact lenses should be instructed to remove contact lenses before administration of the solution and wait at least 15 minutes after instilling BETAGAN    (r)   before reinserting soft contact lenses.



     Muscle Weakness  



  Beta-adrenergic blockade has been reported to potentiate muscle weakness consistent with certain myasthenic symptoms (e.g., diplopia, ptosis and generalized weakness).



     Drug Interactions  



  Although BETAGAN    (r)  ophthalmic solution used alone has little or no effect on pupil size, mydriasis resulting from concomitant therapy with BETAGAN    (r)  and epinephrine may occur.



 Close observation of the patient is recommended when a beta-blocker is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as reserpine, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension.



 Patients receiving beta-adrenergic blocking agents along with either oral or intravenous calcium antagonists should be monitored for possible atrioventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular failure and hypotension. In patients with impaired cardiac function, simultaneous use should be avoided altogether.



 The concomitant use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents with digitalis and calcium antagonists may have additive effects on prolonging atrioventricular conduction time.



 Phenothiazine-related compounds and beta-adrenergic blocking agents may have additive hypotensive effects due to the inhibition of each other's metabolism.



     Risk of Anaphylactic Reaction  



  While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions.



     Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  



  In a lifetime oral study in mice, there were statistically significant (p&lt;=0.05) increases in the incidence of benign leiomyomas in female mice at 200 mg/kg/day (14,000 times the recommended human dose for glaucoma), but not at 12 or 50 mg/kg/day (850 and 3,500 times the human dose). In a two year oral study of levobunolol HCl in rats, there was a statistically significant (p&lt;=0.05) increase in the incidence of benign hepatomas in male rats administered 12,800 times the recommended human dose for glaucoma. Similar differences were not observed in rats administered oral doses equivalent to 350 times to 2,000 times the recommended human dose for glaucoma.



 Levobunolol did not show evidence of mutagenic activity in a battery of microbiological and mammalian in vitro  and in vivo  assays.



 Reproduction and fertility studies in rats showed no adverse effect on male or female fertility at doses up to 1,800 times the recommended human dose for glaucoma.



     Pregnancy  



  Fetotoxicity (as evidenced by a greater number of resorption sites) has been observed in rabbits when doses of levobunolol HCl equivalent to 200 and 700 times the recommended dose for the treatment of glaucoma were given. No fetotoxic effects have been observed in similar studies with rats at up to 1,800 times the human dose for glaucoma. Teratogenic studies with levobunolol in rats at doses up to 25 mg/kg/day (1,800 times the recommended human dose for glaucoma) showed no evidence of fetal malformations. There were no adverse effects on postnatal development of offspring. It appears when results from studies using rats and studies with other beta-adrenergic blockers are examined, that the rabbit may be a particularly sensitive species. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. BETAGAN    (r)  ophthalmic solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.



     Nursing Mothers  



  It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Systemic beta-blockers and topical timolol maleate are known to be excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when BETAGAN    (r)  is administered to a nursing woman.



     Pediatric Use  



  Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.



     Geriatric Use  



  No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients.

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings">     WARNINGS  



  As with other topically applied ophthalmic drugs, BETAGAN    (r)  may be absorbed systemically. The same adverse reactions found with systemic administration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents may occur with topical administration. For example, severe respiratory reactions and cardiac reactions, including death due to bronchospasm in patients with asthma, and rarely death in association with cardiac failure, have been reported with topical application of beta-adrenergic blocking agents (see  CONTRAINDICATIONS  ). Additionally, ophthalmic beta-blockers may impair compensatory tachycardia and increase risk of hypotension.



     Cardiac Failure  



  Sympathetic stimulation may be essential for support of the circulation in individuals with diminished myocardial contractility, and its inhibition by beta-adrenergic receptor blockade may precipitate more severe failure.



     In Patients   W   ithout a History of Cardiac Failure  



  Continued depression of the myocardium with beta-blocking agents over a period of time can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. At the first sign or symptom of cardiac failure, BETAGAN    (r)  ophthalmic solution should be discontinued (see  CONTRAINDICATIONS  ).



     Potentiation of Vascular Insufficiency  



   BETAGAN    (r)   may potentiate syndromes associated with vascular insufficiency (i.e. Raynaud's phenomenon), and therefore, should be used with caution in these patients.



     Obstructive Pulmonary Disease  



  PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (e.g., CHRONIC BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA) OF MILD OR MODERATE SEVERITY, BRONCHOSPASTIC DISEASE OR A HISTORY OF BRONCHOSPASTIC DISEASE (OTHER THAN BRONCHIAL ASTHMA OR A HISTORY OF BRONCHIAL ASTHMA, IN WHICH BETAGAN    (r)  IS CONTRAINDICATED, SEE CONTRAINDICATIONS), SHOULD IN GENERAL NOT RECEIVE BETA BLOCKERS, INCLUDING BETAGAN    (r)  . However, if BETAGAN    (r)  is deemed necessary in such patients, then it should be administered cautiously since it may block bronchodilation produced by endogenous and exogenous catecholamine stimulation of beta2receptors.



     Major Surgery  



  The necessity or desirability of withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents prior to major surgery is controversial. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade impairs the ability of the heart to respond to beta-adrenergically mediated reflex stimuli. This may augment the risk of general anesthesia in surgical procedures. Some patients receiving beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents have been subject to protracted severe hypotension during anesthesia. Difficulty in restarting and maintaining the heartbeat has also been reported. For these reasons, in patients undergoing elective surgery, gradual withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents may be appropriate. 



 If necessary during surgery, the effects of beta-adrenergic blocking agents may be reversed by sufficient doses of such agonists as isoproterenol, dopamine, dobutamine or levarterenol (see  OVERDOSAGE  ).



     Diabetes Mellitus  



  Beta-adrenergic blocking agents should be administered with caution in patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia or to diabetic patients (especially those with labile diabetes) who are receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents may mask the signs and symptoms of acute hypoglycemia.



     Thyrotoxicosis  



  Beta-adrenergic blocking agents may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Patients suspected of developing thyrotoxicosis should be managed carefully to avoid abrupt withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents which might precipitate a thyroid storm.



     Choroidal   D   etachment  



  Choroidal detachment after filtration procedures has been reported with the administration of aqueous suppressant therapy.



 These products contain sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people.
