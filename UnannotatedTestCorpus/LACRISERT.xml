     General  



  If improperly placed, LACRISERT may result in corneal abrasion (see  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  ).



     Information for Patients  



  Patients should be advised to follow the instructions for using LACRISERT which accompany the package.



 Because this product may produce transient blurring of vision, patients should be instructed to exercise caution when operating hazardous machinery or driving a motor vehicle.



     Drug Interactions  



  Application of hydroxypropyl cellulose ophthalmic inserts to the eyes of unanesthetized rabbits immediately prior to or two hours before instilling pilocarpine, proparacaine HCl (0.5%), or phenylephrine (5%) did not markedly alter the magnitude and/or duration of the miotic, local corneal anesthetic, or mydriatic activity, respectively, of these agents.



 Under various treatment schedules, the anti-inflammatory effect of ocularly instilled dexamethasone (0.1%) in unanesthetized rabbits with primary uveitis was not affected by the presence of hydroxypropyl cellulose inserts.



     Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  



  Feeding of hydroxypropyl cellulose to rats at levels up to 5% of their diet produced no gross or histopathologic changes or other deleterious effects.



     Pediatric Use  



  Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.



     Geriatric Use  



  No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients.
