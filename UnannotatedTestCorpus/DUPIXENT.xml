  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     Atopic Dermatitis  



 Three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials (Trials 1, 2, and 3) and one dose-ranging trial (Trial 4) evaluated the safety of DUPIXENT in subjects with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. The safety population had a mean age of 38 years; 41% of subjects were female, 67% were white, 24% were Asian, and 6% were black; in terms of comorbid conditions, 48% of the subjects had asthma, 49% had allergic rhinitis, 37% had food allergy, and 27% had allergic conjunctivitis. In these 4 trials, 1472 subjects were treated with subcutaneous injections of DUPIXENT, with or without concomitant topical corticosteroids (TCS).



 A total of 739 subjects were treated with DUPIXENT for at least 1 year in the development program for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis.



 Trials 1, 2, and 4 compared the safety of DUPIXENT monotherapy to placebo through Week 16. Trial 3 compared the safety of DUPIXENT + TCS to placebo + TCS through Week 52.



     Weeks 0 to 16 (Trials 1 to 4)  :



 In DUPIXENT monotherapy trials (Trials 1, 2, and 4) through Week 16, the proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment because of adverse events was 1.9% in both the DUPIXENT 300 mg Q2W and placebo groups.



 Table 1 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 1% in the DUPIXENT 300 mg Q2W monotherapy groups, and in the DUPIXENT + TCS group, all at a higher rate than in their respective comparator groups during the first 16 weeks of treatment.

               Safety through Week 52 (Trial 3):  
 

 In the DUPIXENT with concomitant TCS trial (Trial 3) through Week 52, the proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment because of adverse events was 1.8% in DUPIXENT 300 mg Q2W + TCS group and 7.6% in the placebo + TCS group. Two subjects discontinued DUPIXENT because of adverse reactions: atopic dermatitis (1 subject) and exfoliative dermatitis (1 subject).



 The safety profile of DUPIXENT + TCS through Week 52 was generally consistent with the safety profile observed at Week 16.



     Asthma  



 A total of 2888 adult and adolescent subjects with moderate-to-severe asthma (AS) were evaluated in 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials of 24 to 52 weeks duration (AS Trials 1, 2, and 3). Of these, 2678 had a history of 1 or more severe exacerbations in the year prior to enrollment despite regular use of medium to high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus an additional controller(s) (AS Trials 1 and 2). A total of 210 subjects with oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma receiving high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus up to two additional controllers were enrolled (AS Trial 3). The safety population (AS Trials 1 and 2) was 12-87 years of age, of which 63% were female, and 82% were white. DUPIXENT 200 mg or 300 mg was administered subcutaneously Q2W, following an initial dose of 400 mg or 600 mg, respectively.



 In AS Trials 1 and 2, the proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment due to adverse events was 4% of the placebo group, 3% of the DUPIXENT 200 mg Q2W group, and 6% of the DUPIXENT 300 mg Q2W group.



 Table 2 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 1% in subjects treated with DUPIXENT and at a higher rate than in their respective comparator groups in Asthma Trials 1 and 2.

          Injection site reactions were most common with the loading (initial) dose.
 

 The safety profile of DUPIXENT through Week 52 was generally consistent with the safety profile observed at Week 24.



     Specific Adverse Reactions  



     Conjunctivitis  



 During the 52-week treatment period of concomitant therapy atopic dermatitis trial (Trial 3), conjunctivitis was reported in 16% of the DUPIXENT 300 mg Q2W + TCS group (20 per 100 subject-years) and in 9% of the placebo + TCS group (10 per 100 subject-years). Among asthma subjects, the frequency of conjunctivitis was similar between DUPIXENT and placebo  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]  .



     Eczema Herpeticum and Herpes Zoster  



 The rate of eczema herpeticum was similar in the placebo and DUPIXENT groups in the atopic dermatitis trials.



 Herpes zoster was reported in &lt;0.1% of the DUPIXENT groups (&lt;1 per 100 subject-years) and in &lt;1% of the placebo group (1 per 100 subject-years) in the 16-week atopic dermatitis monotherapy trials. In the 52-week DUPIXENT + TCS atopic dermatitis trial, herpes zoster was reported in 1% of the DUPIXENT + TCS group (1 per 100 subject-years) and 2% of the placebo + TCS group (2 per 100 subject-years). Among asthma subjects the frequency of herpes zoster was similar between DUPIXENT and placebo.



     Hypersensitivity Reactions  



 Hypersensitivity reactions were reported in &lt;1% of DUPIXENT-treated subjects. These included serum sickness reaction, serum sickness-like reaction, generalized urticaria, rash, erythema nodosum, and anaphylaxis  [see  Contraindications (4)  ,  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  , and  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ].  



     Eosinophils  



 DUPIXENT-treated subjects had a greater initial increase from baseline in blood eosinophil count compared to subjects treated with placebo. In subjects with atopic dermatitis, the mean and median increases in blood eosinophils from baseline to Week 4 were 100 and 0 cells/mcL respectively. In subjects with asthma, the mean and median increases in blood eosinophils from baseline to Week 4 were 130 and 10 cells/mcL respectively. The incidence of treatment-emergent eosinophilia (&gt;=500 cells/mcL) was similar in DUPIXENT and placebo groups. Treatment-emergent eosinophilia (&gt;=5,000 cells/mcL) was reported in &lt;2% of DUPIXENT-treated patients and &lt;0.5% in placebo-treated patients. Blood eosinophil counts declined to near baseline levels during study treatment  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  .



     Cardiovascular  



 In the 1-year placebo controlled trial in subjects with asthma (AS Trial 2), cardiovascular thromboembolic events (cardiovascular deaths, non-fatal myocardial infarctions, and non-fatal strokes) were reported in 1 (0.2%) of the DUPIXENT 200 mg Q2W group, 4 (0.6%) of the DUPIXENT 300 mg Q2W group, and 2 (0.3%) of the placebo group.



 In the 1-year placebo controlled trial in subjects with atopic dermatitis (Trial 3), cardiovascular thromboembolic events (cardiovascular deaths, non-fatal myocardial infarctions, and non-fatal strokes) were reported in 1 (0.9%) of the DUPIXENT + TCS 300 mg Q2W group, 0 (0.0%) of the DUPIXENT + TCS 300 mg QW group, and 1 (0.3%) of the placebo + TCS group.



   6.2 Immunogenicity

  As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to dupilumab in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading.



 Approximately 6% of subjects with atopic dermatitis or asthma who received DUPIXENT 300 mg Q2W for 52 weeks developed antibodies to dupilumab; approximately 2% exhibited persistent ADA responses, and approximately 2% had neutralizing antibodies.



 Approximately 9% of subjects with asthma who received DUPIXENT 200 mg Q2W for 52 weeks developed antibodies to dupilumab; approximately 4% exhibited persistent ADA responses, and approximately 4% had neutralizing antibodies.



 Approximately 5% of subjects in the placebo groups in the 52-week studies were positive for antibodies to DUPIXENT; approximately 2% exhibited persistent ADA responses, and approximately 1% had neutralizing antibodies.



 The antibody titers detected in both DUPIXENT and placebo subjects were mostly low. In subjects who received DUPIXENT, development of high titer antibodies to dupilumab was associated with lower serum dupilumab concentrations  [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  .



 Two subjects who experienced high titer antibody responses developed serum sickness or serum sickness-like reactions during DUPIXENT therapy  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ].

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *   Hypersensitivity : Hypersensitivity reactions (urticaria, rash, erythema nodosum, anaphylaxis, and serum sickness) have occurred after administration of DUPIXENT. Discontinue DUPIXENT in the event of a hypersensitivity reaction. (  5.1  ) 
 *   Conjunctivitis and Keratitis : Atopic Dermatitis: Patients should report new onset or worsening eye symptoms to their healthcare provider. (  5.2  ) 
 *   Eosinophilic Conditions : Be alert to vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, and/or neuropathy, especially upon reduction of oral corticosteroids. (  5.3  ) 
 *   Reduction of Corticosteroid Dosage : Do not discontinue systemic, topical, or inhaled corticosteroids abruptly upon initiation of therapy with DUPIXENT. Decrease steroids gradually, if appropriate. (  5.5  ) 
 *   Parasitic (Helminth) Infections : Treat patients with pre-existing helminth infections before initiating therapy with DUPIXENT. If patients become infected while receiving treatment with DUPIXENT and do not respond to anti-helminth treatment, discontinue treatment with DUPIXENT until the infection resolves. (  5.7  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Hypersensitivity



   Hypersensitivity reactions, including generalized urticaria, rash, erythema nodosum and serum sickness or serum sickness-like reactions, were reported in less than 1% of subjects who received DUPIXENT in clinical trials. Two subjects in the atopic dermatitis development program experienced serum sickness or serum sickness-like reactions that were associated with high titers of antibodies to dupilumab. One subject in the asthma development program experienced anaphylaxis [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ]  . If a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction occurs, institute appropriate therapy and discontinue DUPIXENT [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1  ,  6.2)  ]  .  



    5.2 Conjunctivitis and Keratitis



   Conjunctivitis and keratitis occurred more frequently in atopic dermatitis subjects who received DUPIXENT. Conjunctivitis was the most frequently reported eye disorder. Most subjects with conjunctivitis recovered or were recovering during the treatment period. Among asthma subjects the frequency of conjunctivitis was similar between DUPIXENT and placebo [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .  



  Keratitis was reported in &lt;1% of the DUPIXENT group (1 per 100 subject-years) and in 0% of the placebo group (0 per 100 subject-years) in the 16-week atopic dermatitis monotherapy trials. In the 52-week DUPIXENT + topical corticosteroids (TCS) atopic dermatitis trial, keratitis was reported in 4% of the DUPIXENT + TCS group (12 per 100 subject-years) and in 0% of the placebo + TCS group (0 per 100 subject-years). Most subjects with keratitis recovered or were recovering during the treatment period. Among asthma subjects the frequency of keratitis was similar between DUPIXENT and placebo [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].    



  Advise patients to report new onset or worsening eye symptoms to their healthcare provider.  



    5.3 Eosinophilic Conditions



   Patients being treated for asthma may present with serious systemic eosinophilia sometimes presenting with clinical features of eosinophilic pneumonia or vasculitis consistent with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, conditions which are often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These events may be associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. Physicians should be alert to vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients with eosinophilia. Cases of eosinophilic pneumonia and cases of vasculitis consistent with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis have been reported with DUPIXENT in adult patients who participated in the asthma development program. A causal association between DUPIXENT and these conditions has not been established.  



    5.4 Acute Asthma Symptoms or Deteriorating Disease



   DUPIXENT should not be used to treat acute asthma symptoms or acute exacerbations. Do not use DUPIXENT to treat acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus. Patients should seek medical advice if their asthma remains uncontrolled or worsens after initiation of treatment with DUPIXENT.  



    5.5 Reduction of Corticosteroid Dosage



   Do not discontinue systemic, topical, or inhaled corticosteroids abruptly upon initiation of therapy with DUPIXENT. Reductions in corticosteroid dose, if appropriate, should be gradual and performed under the direct supervision of a physician. Reduction in corticosteroid dose may be associated with systemic withdrawal symptoms and/or unmask conditions previously suppressed by systemic corticosteroid therapy.  



    5.6 Atopic Dermatitis Patients with Comorbid Asthma



   Advise atopic dermatitis patients with comorbid asthma not to adjust or stop their asthma treatments without consultation with their physicians.  



    5.7 Parasitic (Helminth) Infections



   Patients with known helminth infections were excluded from participation in clinical studies. It is unknown if DUPIXENT will influence the immune response against helminth infections.  



  Treat patients with pre-existing helminth infections before initiating therapy with DUPIXENT. If patients become infected while receiving treatment with DUPIXENT and do not respond to anti-helminth treatment, discontinue treatment with DUPIXENT until the infection resolves.
