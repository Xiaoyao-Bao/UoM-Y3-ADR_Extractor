    <Section id="S1" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *   Residual Paralysis : Patients with neuromuscular diseases are at higher risk. Use a lower initial bolus dose and consider using a reversal agent in these patients. (  2.2  ,  5.1  ) 
 *   Benzyl Alcohol : Consider combined daily load of benzyl alcohol from all sources when the 10 mL multiple dose vials are used in infants (  4  ,  5.2  ) 
 *   Risk of Seizure : Monitor level of neuromuscular blockade during long-term administration to limit exposure to toxic metabolites (  5.3  ) 
 *   Hypersensitivity Reactions and Anaphylaxis : Severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions have been reported. Consider cross-reactivity among neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non-depolarizing. (  4  ,  5.4  ) 
 *   Risk of Death due to Medication Errors : Accidental administration can cause death. (  5.5  ) 
 *   Inadequate Anesthesia : Use NIMBEX in the presence of appropriate sedation or general anesthesia and monitor patients to ensure level of anesthesia is adequate (  5.6  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Residual Paralysis



   NIMBEX has been associated with residual paralysis. Patients with neuromuscular diseases (e.g., myasthenia gravis and myasthenic syndrome) and carcinomatosis may be at higher risk of residual paralysis; thus, a lower maximum initial bolus is recommended in these patients [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  ) and Use in Specific Populations (  8.10  )]  . To prevent complications resulting from NIMBEX-associated residual paralysis, extubation is recommended only after the patient has recovered sufficiently from neuromuscular blockade. Consider use of a reversal agent especially in cases where residual paralysis is more likely to occur [see Overdosage (  10  )]  .  



    5.2 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative in 10 mL Multiple-Dose Vials



  Serious and fatal adverse reactions including "gasping syndrome" can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including NIMBEX (10 mL multiple-dose vials). This warning is not applicable to the 5 mL and 20 mL NIMBEX single-dose vials because these vials do not contain benzyl alcohol. The "gasping syndrome" is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations.



 When prescribing the 10 mL multiple-dose NIMBEX vials in infants consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including NIMBEX (multiple-dose vials contain 9 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL) and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which serious adverse reactions may occur is not known [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.4  )]  .



 The use of 10 mL NIMBEX multiple-dose vials is contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 1 month of age and low birth-weight infants because these patients are more likely to develop benzyl alcohol toxicity [see Contraindications (  4  )]  .



    5.3 Risk of Seizure



  Laudanosine, an active metabolite of NIMBEX, has been shown to cause seizures in animals. NIMBEX-treated patients with renal or hepatic impairment may have higher metabolite concentrations (including laudanosine) than patients with normal renal and hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )]  . Therefore, patients with renal or hepatic impairment receiving extended administration of NIMBEX may be at higher risk of seizures.



 The level of neuromuscular blockade during long-term NIMBEX administration should be monitored with a nerve stimulator to titrate NIMBEX administration to the patients' needs and limit exposure to toxic metabolites.



    5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Including Anaphylaxis



  Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including fatal and life-threatening anaphylactic reactions, have been reported [see Contraindications (  4  )]  . There have been reports of wheezing, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, rash and itching following NIMBEX administration in pediatric patients. Due to the potential severity of these reactions, appropriate precautions such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment should be taken. Precautions should also be taken in those patients who have had previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents since cross-reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non-depolarizing, has been reported.



    5.5 Risk of Death Due to Medication Errors



   Administration of NIMBEX results in paralysis, which may lead to respiratory arrest and death, a progression that may be more likely to occur in a patient for whom it is not intended. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. If another healthcare provider is administering the product, ensure that the intended dose is clearly labeled and communicated.  



    5.6 Risks Due to Inadequate Anesthesia



  Neuromuscular blockade in the conscious patient can lead to distress. Use NIMBEX in the presence of appropriate sedation or general anesthesia. Monitor patients to ensure that the level of anesthesia is adequate.



    5.7 Risk for Infection



  The 20 mL vial of NIMBEX is intended only for administration as an infusion for use in a single patient in the ICU. The 20 mL vial should not be used multiple times because there is a higher risk of infection (the 20 mL vial does not contain a preservative).



    5.8 Potentiation of Neuromuscular Blockade



  Certain drugs may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of NIMBEX including inhalational anesthetics, antibiotics, magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide and quinidine [see Drug Interactions (  7.1  )]  . Additionally, acid-base and/or serum electrolyte abnormalities may potentiate the action of neuromuscular blocking agents. Use peripheral nerve stimulation and monitor the clinical signs of neuromuscular blockade to determine the adequacy of the level of neuromuscular blockage and the need to adjust the NIMBEX dosage.



    5.9 Resistance to Neuromuscular Blockade with Certain Drugs



  Shorter durations of neuromuscular block may occur and NIMBEX infusion rate requirements may be higher in patients chronically administered phenytoin or carbamazepine [see Drug Interactions (  7.1  ) and Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )]  . Use peripheral nerve stimulation and monitor the clinical signs of neuromuscular blockade to determine the adequacy of neuromuscular blockage and the need to adjust the NIMBEX dosage.



    5.10 Malignant Hyperthermia (MH)



  NIMBEX has not been studied in MH-susceptible patients. Because MH can develop in the absence of established triggering agents, the clinician should be prepared to recognize and treat MH in any patient undergoing general anesthesia.
