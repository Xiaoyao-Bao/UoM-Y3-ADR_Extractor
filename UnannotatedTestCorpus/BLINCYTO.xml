  6.1       Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     MRD-positive B-cell Precursor ALL    



     



   The safety of BLINCYTO in patients with MRD-positive B-cell precursor ALL was evaluated in two single-arm clinical studies in which 137 patients were treated with BLINCYTO. The median age of the study population was 45 years (range: 18 to 77 years).  



     



   The most common adverse reactions (&gt;= 20%) were pyrexia, infusion related reactions, headache, infections (pathogen unspecified), tremor, and chills. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 61% of patients. The most common serious adverse reactions (&gt;= 2%) included pyrexia, tremor, encephalopathy, aphasia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, overdose, device related infection, seizure, and staphylococcal infection. Adverse reactions of Grade 3 or higher were reported in 64% of patients. Discontinuation of therapy due to adverse reactions occurred in 17% of patients; neurologic events were the most frequently reported reasons for discontinuation. There were 2 fatal adverse events that occurred within 30 days of the end of BLINCYTO treatment (atypical pneumonia and subdural hemorrhage).  



     



   Table 9 summarizes the adverse reactions occurring at a &gt;= 10% incidence for any grade or &gt;= 5% incidence for Grade 3 or higher.

   Philadelphia Chromosome    -negative Relapsed or Refractory B    -cell Precursor ALL  



 The safety data described below reflect exposure to BLINCYTO in a randomized, open-label, active-controlled clinical study (TOWER Study) in which 376 patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL were treated with BLINCYTO (n = 267) or standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy (n = 109). The median age of BLINCYTO-treated patients was 37 years (range: 18 to 80 years), 60% were male, 84% were White, 7% Asian, 2% were Black or African American, 2% were American Indian or Alaska Native, and 5% were Multiple/Other.



 The most common adverse reactions (&gt;= 20%) in the BLINCYTO arm were infections (bacterial and pathogen unspecified), pyrexia, headache, infusion-related reactions, anemia, febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 62% of patients. The most common serious adverse reactions (&gt;= 2%) included febrile neutropenia, pyrexia, sepsis, pneumonia, overdose, septic shock, CRS, bacterial sepsis, device related infection, and bacteremia. Adverse reactions of Grade 3 or higher were reported in 87% of patients. Discontinuation of therapy due to adverse reactions occurred in 12% of patients treated with BLINCYTO; neurologic events and infections were the most frequently reported reasons for discontinuation of treatment due to an adverse reaction. Fatal adverse events occurred in 16% of patients. The majority of the fatal events were infections.



 The adverse reactions occurring at a &gt;= 10% incidence for any grade or &gt;= 5% incidence for Grade 3 or higher in the BLINCYTO-treated patients in first cycle of therapy are summarized in Table 10.

   6.2       Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of BLINCYTO. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 *  Fatal pancreatitis has been reported in patients receiving BLINCYTO in combination with dexamethasone [see Warnings and Precautions (    5.8    )] . 
      6.3       Immunogenicity
   As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The immunogenicity of BLINCYTO has been evaluated using either an electrochemiluminescence detection technology (ECL) or an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) screening immunoassay for the detection of binding anti-blinatumomab antibodies.  For patients whose sera tested positive in the screening immunoassay, an  in vitro       biological     assay was performed to detect neutralizing antibodies.



 In clinical studies, less than 2% of patients treated with BLINCYTO     tested positive for binding anti-blinatumomab antibodies. Of patients who developed anti-blinatumomab antibodies, 7 out of 9 (78%) had  in vitro  neutralizing activity. Anti-blinatumomab antibody formation may affect pharmacokinetics of BLINCYTO.



 If formation of anti-blinatumomab     antibodies with a clinically significant effect is suspected, contact Amgen at 1-800-77-AMGEN (1-800-772-6436) to discuss antibody testing.



 The detection of anti-blinatumomab antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to blinatumomab with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.

   5.1       Cytokine Release Syndrome



   Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), which may be life-threatening or fatal, occurred in patients receiving BLINCYTO. The median time to onset of CRS was 2 days after the start of infusion. Manifestations of CRS include fever, headache, nausea, asthenia, hypotension, increased alanine aminotransferase, increased aspartate aminotransferase, increased total bilirubin, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The manifestations of CRS after treatment with BLINCYTO overlap with those of infusion reactions, capillary leak syndrome (CLS), and hemophagocytic histiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Using all of these terms to define CRS in clinical trials of BLINCYTO, CRS was reported in 15% of patients with relapsed or refractory ALL and in 7% of patients with MRD-positive ALL.  



    



  Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of these events. Advise outpatients on BLINCYTO to contact their healthcare professional for signs and symptoms associated with CRS. If severe CRS occurs, interrupt BLINCYTO until CRS resolves. Discontinue BLINCYTO permanently if life-threatening CRS occurs [see Dosage and Administration (     2.3     )]  .  



    5.2       Neurological Toxicities



   In patients with ALL receiving BLINCYTO in clinical studies, neurological toxicities have occurred in approximately 65% of patients. Among patients that experienced a neurologic event, the median time to the first event was within the first 2 weeks of BLINCYTO treatment and the majority of events resolved. The most common (&gt;= 10%) manifestations of neurological toxicity were headache, and tremor; the neurological toxicity profile varied by age group [see Use in Specific Populations (     8.4     ,     8.5     )]   .  Grade 3 or higher (severe, life-threatening, or fatal) neurological toxicities following initiation of BLINCYTO administration occurred in approximately 13% of patients and included encephalopathy, convulsions, speech disorders, disturbances in consciousness, confusion and disorientation, and coordination and balance disorders.  Manifestations of neurological toxicity included cranial nerve disorders. The majority of neurologic events resolved following interruption of BLINCYTO, but some resulted in treatment discontinuation.  



    



  There is limited experience with BLINCYTO in patients with active ALL in the central nervous system (CNS) or a history of neurologic events. Patients with a history or presence of clinically relevant CNS pathology were excluded from clinical studies.  



 Monitor patients receiving BLINCYTO for signs and symptoms of neurological toxicities.  Advise outpatients on BLINCYTO to contact their healthcare professional if they develop signs or symptoms of neurological toxicities. Interrupt or discontinue BLINCYTO as recommended [see Dosage and Administration (     2.3     )].    



    5.3       Infections



   In patients with ALL receiving BLINCYTO in clinical studies, serious infections such as sepsis, pneumonia, bacteremia, opportunistic infections, and catheter-site infections were observed in approximately 25% of patients, some of which were life-threatening or fatal. As appropriate, administer prophylactic antibiotics and employ surveillance testing during treatment with BLINCYTO. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection and treat appropriately.  



    5.4       Tumor Lysis Syndrome



  Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), which may be life-threatening or fatal, has been observed in patients receiving BLINCYTO. Appropriate prophylactic measures, including pretreatment nontoxic cytoreduction and on-treatment hydration, should be used for the prevention of TLS during BLINCYTO treatment. Monitor for signs or symptoms of TLS. Management of these events may require either temporary interruption or discontinuation of BLINCYTO [see Dosage and Administration (     2.3     )]  .



    5.5       Neutropenia and Febrile Neutropenia



  Neutropenia and febrile neutropenia, including life-threatening cases, have been observed in patients receiving BLINCYTO. Monitor laboratory parameters (including, but not limited to, white blood cell count and absolute neutrophil count) during BLINCYTO infusion. Interrupt BLINCYTO if prolonged neutropenia occurs.



    5.6       Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines



  Due to the potential for neurologic events, including seizures, patients receiving BLINCYTO are at risk for loss of consciousness [see Warnings and Precautions (     5.2     )]  . Advise patients to refrain from driving and engaging in hazardous occupations or activities such as operating heavy or potentially dangerous machinery while BLINCYTO is being administered.



    5.7       Elevated Liver Enzymes



     



  Treatment with BLINCYTO was associated with transient elevations in liver enzymes.  In patients with ALL receiving BLINCYTO in clinical studies, the median time to onset of elevated liver enzymes was 3 days.  



    



  The majority of these transient elevations in liver enzymes were observed in the setting of CRS. For the events that were observed outside the setting of CRS, the median time to onset was 19 days. Grade 3 or greater elevations in liver enzymes occurred in approximately 7% of patients outside the setting of CRS and resulted in treatment discontinuation in less than 1% of patients.  



    



  Monitor alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and total blood bilirubin prior to the start of and during BLINCYTO treatment. Interrupt BLINCYTO if the transaminases rise to greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal or if total bilirubin rises to more than 3 times the upper limit of normal.  



    5.8       Pancreatitis



  Fatal pancreatitis has been reported in patients receiving BLINCYTO in combination with dexamethasone in clinical studies and the postmarketing setting  [see Adverse Reactions (     6.2     )]  .



 Evaluate patients who develop signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. Management of pancreatitis may require either temporary interruption or discontinuation of BLINCYTO and dexamethasone [see Dosage and Administration (     2.3     )].  



    5.9       Leukoencephalopathy



  Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes showing leukoencephalopathy have been observed in patients receiving BLINCYTO, especially in patients with prior treatment with cranial irradiation and antileukemic chemotherapy (including systemic high-dose methotrexate or intrathecal cytarabine). The clinical significance of these imaging changes is unknown.   



    5.10       Preparation and Administration Errors



  Preparation and administration errors have occurred with BLINCYTO treatment. Follow instructions for preparation (including admixing) and administration strictly to minimize medication errors (including underdose and overdose) [see Dosage and Administration (     2.4     )]  .



    5.11       Immunization



  The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines during or following BLINCYTO therapy has not been studied. Vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended for at least 2 weeks prior to the start of BLINCYTO treatment, during treatment, and until immune recovery following last cycle of BLINCYTO.



    5.12       Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative



   Serious and fatal adverse reactions including "gasping syndrome" can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including BLINCYTO (with preservative). The "gasping syndrome" is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations.  



    



  When prescribing BLINCYTO (with preservative) for pediatric patients, consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including BLINCYTO (with preservative) (contains 7.4 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL) and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which serious adverse reactions may occur is not known [see Use in Specific Populations (     8.4     )].    



    



  Due to the addition of bacteriostatic saline, 7-day bags of BLINCYTO solution for infusion with preservative contain benzyl alcohol and are not recommended for use in any patients weighing less than 22 kg [see Dosage and Administration (     2.6     ) and Use in Specific Populations (     8.4     )].
