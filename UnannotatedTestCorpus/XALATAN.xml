  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

 XALATAN was studied in three multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trials. Patients received 50 mcg/mL XALATAN once daily or 5 mg/mL active-comparator (timolol) twice daily. The patient population studied had a mean age of 65+/-10 years. Seven percent of patients withdrew before the 6-month endpoint.

   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of XALATAN in clinical practice. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions, which have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, possible causal connection to XALATAN, or a combination of these factors, include:

   Nervous System disorders  : Dizziness; headache; toxic epidermal necrolysis

   Eye Disorders  : Eyelash and vellus hair changes of the eyelid (increased length, thickness, pigmentation, and number of eyelashes); keratitis; corneal edema and erosions; intraocular inflammation (iritis/uveitis); macular edema, including cystoid macular edema; trichiasis; periorbital and lid changes resulting in deepening of the eyelid sulcus; iris cyst; eyelid skin darkening; localised skin reaction on the eyelids; conjunctivitis; pseudopemphigoid of the ocular conjunctiva

   Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders  : Asthma and exacerbation of asthma; dyspnea

   Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders:  Pruritus

   Infections and Infestations  : Herpes keratitis

   Cardiac Disorders  : Angina; palpitations; angina unstable

   General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions  : Chest pain

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">   5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

   EXCERPT:    *  Pigmentation: pigmentation of the iris, periorbital tissue (eyelid) and eyelashes can occur. Iris pigmentation likely to be permanent. (  5.1  ) 
 *  Eyelash Changes: gradual change to eyelashes including increased length, thickness and number of lashes. Usually reversible. (  5.2  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Pigmentation

  XALATAN has been reported to cause changes to pigmented tissues. The most frequently reported changes have been increased pigmentation of the iris, periorbital tissue (eyelid), and eyelashes. Pigmentation is expected to increase as long as latanoprost is administered.

 The pigmentation change is due to increased melanin content in the melanocytes rather than to an increase in the number of melanocytes. After discontinuation of latanoprost, pigmentation of the iris is likely to be permanent, while pigmentation of the periorbital tissue and eyelash changes have been reported to be reversible in some patients. Patients who receive treatment should be informed of the possibility of increased pigmentation. Beyond 5 years the effects of increased pigmentation are not known [ see  Clinical Studies (14.2)    ].

 Iris color change may not be noticeable for several months to years. Typically, the brown pigmentation around the pupil spreads concentrically towards the periphery of the iris and the entire iris or parts of the iris become more brownish. Neither nevi nor freckles of the iris appear to be affected by treatment. While treatment with XALATAN can be continued in patients who develop noticeably increased iris pigmentation, these patients should be examined regularly [ see  Patient Counseling Information (17)    ].

    5.2 Eyelash Changes

  XALATAN may gradually change eyelashes and vellus hair in the treated eye; these changes include increased length, thickness, pigmentation, the number of lashes or hairs, and misdirected growth of eyelashes. Eyelash changes are usually reversible upon discontinuation of treatment [ see  Patient Counseling Information (17)    ].

    5.3 Intraocular Inflammation

  XALATAN should be used with caution in patients with a history of intraocular inflammation (iritis/uveitis) and should generally not be used in patients with active intraocular inflammation because inflammation may be exacerbated.

    5.4 Macular Edema

  Macular edema, including cystoid macular edema, has been reported during treatment with XALATAN. XALATAN should be used with caution in aphakic patients, in pseudophakic patients with a torn posterior lens capsule, or in patients with known risk factors for macular edema.

    5.5 Herpetic Keratitis

  Reactivation of Herpes Simplex keratitis has been reported during treatment with XALATAN. XALATAN should be used with caution in patients with a history of herpetic keratitis. XALATAN should be avoided in cases of active herpes simplex keratitis because inflammation may be exacerbated.

    5.6 Bacterial Keratitis

  There have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of multiple-dose containers of topical ophthalmic products. These containers had been inadvertently contaminated by patients who, in most cases, had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface [ see  Patient Counseling Information (17)    ].

    5.7 Use with Contact Lenses

  Contact lenses should be removed prior to the administration of XALATAN, and may be reinserted 15 minutes after administration.
