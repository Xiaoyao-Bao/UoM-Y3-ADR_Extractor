 Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates.



 The following additional adverse reactions have been reported with estrogen and/or progestin therapy.



 *  1. Genitourinary system Changes in vaginal bleeding pattern and abnormal withdrawal bleeding or flow; breakthrough bleeding; spotting; dysmenorrhea, increase in size of uterine leiomyomata; vaginitis, including vaginal candidiasis; change in amount of cervical secretion; changes in cervical ectropion; ovarian cancer; endometrial hyperplasia; endometrial cancer.  
 *  2. Breasts Tenderness, enlargement, pain, nipple discharge, galactorrhea; fibrocystic breast changes; breast cancer.

    BOXED WARNING: 

  

    ESTROGENS INCREASE THE RISK OF ENDOMETRIAL CANCER  



 Close clinical surveillance of all women taking estrogens is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in all cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding. There is no evidence that the use of "natural" estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens at equivalent estrogen doses. (See   WARNINGS, Malignant neoplasms, Endometrial cancer  ).



      



   CARDIOVASCULAR AND OTHER RISKS  



 Estrogens and progestins should not be used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. (See   WARNINGS, Cardiovascular disorders  ).



 The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study reported increased risks of myocardial infarction, stroke, invasive breast cancer, pulmonary emboli, and deep vein thrombosis in postmenopausal women (50 to 79 years of age) during



 5 years of treatment with oral conjugated estrogens (CE 0.625 mg) combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA 2.5 mg) relative to placebo. (See   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies  ).



 The Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS), a substudy of WHI, reported increased risk of developing probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age or older during 4 years of treatment with oral conjugated estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone acetate relative to placebo. It is unknown whether this finding applies to younger postmenopausal women or to women taking estrogen alone therapy. (See   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies  ).



 Other doses of oral conjugated estrogens with medroxyprogesterone acetate, and other combinations and dosage forms of estrogens and progestins were not studied in the WHI clinical trials and, in the absence of comparable data, these risks should be assumed to be similar. Because of these risks, estrogens with or without progestins should be prescribed at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman.

    BOXED WARNING: PATIENT INFORMATION

  PATIENT INFORMATION

    DELESTROGEN  (r)    



   (estradiol valerate injection, USP)  



 Read this   PATIENT INFORMATION   before you start taking DELESTROGEN and read what you get each time you refill DELESTROGEN. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment.



   

    WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT INFORMATION I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT DELESTROGEN (AN ESTROGEN HORMONE)?  



 *  Estrogens increase the chances of getting cancer of the uterus.Report any unusual vaginal bleeding right away while you are taking estrogens. Vaginal bleeding after menopause may be a warning sign of cancer of the uterus (womb). Your healthcare provider should check any unusual vaginal bleeding to find out the cause. 
 *  Do not use estrogens with or without progestins to prevent heart disease, heart attacks, or strokes.Using estrogens with or without progestins may increase your chances of getting heart attacks, strokes, breast cancer, and blood clots. Using estrogens with progestins may increase your risk of dementia. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with DELESTROGEN. 
      
     What is DELESTROGEN?  



 DELESTROGEN is a medicine that contains estrogen hormones.



   What is DELESTROGEN used for?  



 DELESTROGEN is used after menopause to:



 *  reduce moderate to severe hot flashes. Estrogens are hormones made by a woman's ovaries. The ovaries normally stop making estrogens when a woman is between 45 to 55 years old. This drop in body estrogen levels causes the "change of life" or menopause (the end of monthly menstrual periods). Sometimes, both ovaries are removed during an operation before natural menopause takes place. The sudden drop in estrogen levels causes "surgical menopause."When the estrogen levels begin dropping, some women develop very uncomfortable symptoms, such as feeling of warmth in the face, neck, and chest, or sudden strong feelings of heat and sweating ("hot flashes" or "hot flushes"). In some women, the symptoms are mild, and they will not need estrogens. In other women, symptoms can be more severe. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with DELESTROGEN. 
 *  treat moderate to severe dryness, itching, and burning in and around the vagina. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with DELESTROGEN to control these problems. If you use DELESTROGEN only to treat your dryness, itching, and burning in and around your vagina, talk with your healthcare provider about whether a topical vaginal product would be better for you. 
      Who should not take DELESTROGEN?   
 

 Do not start taking DELESTROGEN if you: 



 *  have unusual vaginal bleeding. 
 *  currently have or have had certain cancers. Estrogens may increase the chances of getting certain types of cancers, including cancer of the breast or uterus. If you have or had cancer, talk with your healthcare provider about whether you should take DELESTROGEN. 
 *  had a stroke or heart attack in the past year. 
 *  currently have or have had blood clots. 
 *  currently have or have had liver problems. 
 *  are allergic to DELESTROGEN or any of its ingredients. See the end of this leaflet for a list of ingredients in DELESTROGEN. 
 *  think you may be pregnant. 
      Tell your healthcare provider:  
 

 *  if you are breastfeeding. The hormone in DELESTROGEN can pass into your milk. 
 *  about all of your medical problems. Your healthcare provider may need to check you more carefully if you have certain conditions, such as asthma (wheezing), epilepsy (seizures), migraine, endometriosis, lupus, problems with your heart, liver, thyroid, kidneys, or have high calcium levels in your blood. 
 *  about all the medicines you take. This includes prescription and nonprescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Some medicines may affect how DELESTROGEN works. DELESTROGEN may also affect how your other medicines work. 
 *  if you are going to have surgery or will be on bed rest. You may need to stop taking estrogens. 
      How should I take DELESTROGEN?  
 

 DELESTROGEN should be injected deeply into the upper, outer quadrant of the gluteal muscle following the usual precautions for intramuscular administration. By virtue of the low viscosity of the vehicles, the various preparations of DELESTROGEN (estradiol valerate injection, USP) may be administered with a small gauge needle (i.e., 20 Gauge * 1 1/2 inches long). Since the 40 mg potency provides a high concentration in a small volume, particular care should be observed to administer the full dose.



 DELESTROGEN should be visually inspected for particulate matter and color prior to administration; the solution is clear, colorless to pale yellow. Storage at low temperatures may result in the separation of some crystalline material which redissolves readily on warming.



   Note:   A dry needle and syringe should be used. Use of a wet needle or syringe may cause the solution to become cloudy; however, this does not affect the potency of the material.



 *  1.Start at the lowest dose and talk to your healthcare provider about how well that dose is working for you. 
 *  2.Estrogens should be used at the lowest dose possible for your treatment only as long as needed. The lowest effective dose of DELESTROGEN has not been determined. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly (for example, every 3 to 6 months) about the dose you are taking and whether you still need treatment with DELESTROGEN. 
      How should I dispose of used syringes and needles?  
 

 *  1.Do not re-use needles or syringes. 
 *  2.Do not throw the needles and syringes in household waste. These should be discarded into an appropriate container (such as a sharps container) immediately after use. Refer to state or local laws and regulations for appropriate container requirements. 
 *  3.Make sure the container is tightly capped. 
 *  4.Strategically place the container so as to minimize handling and keep out of the reach of children. 
 *  5.Label the container indicating the presence of used needles/sharps. 
 *  6.For disposal of containers containing used needles and syringes refer to the state or local laws and regulations or as instructed by your healthcare provider or pharmacist. 
 *  7.Refer to your health care provider or pharmacist for guidance, and for additional information contact the Coalition for Safe Community Needle Disposal online at 
    http://www.safeneedledisposal.org or refer to the FDA website Needles and Other Sharps at http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/HomeHealthandConsumer/ConsumerProducts/Sharps/default.htm
 

   How should I dispose of expired or unused DELESTROGEN?  



 *  1.Do not flush unused DELESTROGEN or pour down the sink or drain. 
 *  2.Refer to the state or local laws and regulations for the safest and proper disposal of injectable medications. Contact your city or county government's household trash and recycling service to find out if a drug take-back program is available in your community. You can also refer to your health care provider or pharmacist for guidance. 
 *  3.For additional information refer to the following FDA websites:

   What are the possible side effects of estrogens?  



   Less common but serious side effects include:  



 *  Breast cancer 
 *  Cancer of the uterus 
 *  Stroke 
 *  Heart attack 
 *  Blood clots 
 *  Dementia 
 *  Gallbladder disease 
 *  Ovarian cancer 
      These are some of the warning signs of serious side effects:  
 

 *  Breast lumps 
 *  Unusual vaginal bleeding 
 *  Dizziness and faintness 
 *  Changes in speech 
 *  Severe headaches 
 *  Chest pain 
 *  Shortness of breath 
 *  Pains in your legs 
 *  Changes in vision 
 *  Vomiting 
    Call your healthcare provider right away if you get any of these warning signs, or any other unusual symptom that concerns you.
 

   Common side effects include:  



 *  Headache 
 *  Breast pain 
 *  Irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting 
 *  Stomach/abdominal cramps, bloating 
 *  Nausea and vomiting 
 *  Hair loss 
      Other side effects include:  
 

 *  High blood pressure 
 *  Liver problems 
 *  High blood sugar 
 *  Fluid retention 
 *  Enlargement of benign tumors of the uterus ("fibroids") 
 *  Vaginal yeast infection 
    These are not all the possible side effects of DELESTROGEN. For more information, ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist.
 

   What can I do to lower my chances of a serious side effect with DELESTROGEN?   



 Talk with your healthcare provider regularly about whether you should continue taking DELESTROGEN. If you have a uterus, talk to your healthcare provider about whether the addition of a progestin is right for you. See your healthcare provider right away if you get vaginal bleeding while taking DELESTROGEN. Have a breast exam and mammogram (breast X-ray) every year unless your healthcare provider tells you something else. If members of your family have had breast cancer or if you have ever had breast lumps or an abnormal mammogram, you may need to have breast exams more often. If you have high blood pressure, high cholesterol (fat in the blood), diabetes, are overweight, or if you use tobacco, you may have higher chances for getting heart disease. Ask your healthcare provider for ways to lower your chances for getting heart disease.



   General information about safe and effective use of DELESTROGEN

    <Section id="S3" name="precautions">    PRECAUTIONS



   A. GENERAL



   1. Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomy



  Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer.



 There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include a possible increased risk of breast cancer.



    2. Elevated blood pressure



  In a small number of case reports, substantial increases in blood pressure have been attributed to idiosyncratic reactions to estrogens. In a large, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, a generalized effect of estrogen therapy on blood pressure was not seen. Blood pressure should be monitored at regular intervals with estrogen use.



    3. Hypertriglyceridemia



  In patients with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis and other complications.



    4. Impaired liver function and past history of cholestatic jaundice



  Estrogens may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. For patients with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued.



    5. Hypothyroidism



  Estrogen administration leads to increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels. Patients with normal thyroid function can compensate for the increased TBG by making more thyroid hormone, thus maintaining free T4and T3serum concentrations in the normal range. Patients dependent on thyroid hormone replacement therapy who are also receiving estrogens may require increased doses of their thyroid replacement therapy. These patients should have their thyroid function monitored in order to maintain their free thyroid hormone levels in an acceptable range.



    6. Fluid retention



  Because estrogens may cause some degree of fluid retention, patients with conditions that might be influenced by this factor, such as a cardiac or renal dysfunction, warrant careful observation when estrogens are prescribed.



    7. Hypocalcemia



  Estrogens should be used with caution in individuals with severe hypocalcemia.



    8. Exacerbation of endometriosis



  Endometriosis may be exacerbated with administration of estrogens. A few cases of malignant transformation of residual endometrial implants have been reported in women treated post-hysterectomy with estrogen alone therapy. For patients known to have residual endometriosis post-hysterectomy, the addition of progestin should be considered.



    9. Exacerbation of other conditions



  Estrogens may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine or porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions.



    10. Hypercoagulability



  Some studies have shown that women taking estrogen replacement therapy have hypercoagulability, primarily related to decreased antithrombin activity. This effect appears dose- and duration-dependent and is less pronounced than that associated with oral contraceptive use. Also, postmenopausal women tend to have increased coagulation parameters at baseline compared to premenopausal women. There is some suggestion that low dose postmenopausal mestranol may increase the risk of thromboembolism, although the majority of studies (of primarily conjugated estrogens users) report no such increase.



    11. Uterine bleeding and mastodynia



  Certain patients may develop undesirable manifestations of estrogenic stimulation, such as abnormal uterine bleeding and mastodynia.



    B. Patient Information



  Physicians are advised to discuss the   PATIENT INFORMATION    leaflet with patients for whom they prescribe DELESTROGEN.



    C. Laboratory Tests



  Estrogen administration should be initiated at the lowest dose approved for the indication and then guided by clinical response rather than by serum hormone levels (e.g., estradiol, FSH).



    D. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions



    *  1.Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet aggregation time; increased platelet count; increased factors II, VII antigen, VIII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX, X, XII, VII-X complex, II-VII-X complex, and beta-thromboglobulin; decreased levels of antifactor Xa and antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity; increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity; increased plasminogen antigen and activity. 
 *  2.Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone levels as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4levels (by column or by radioimmunoassay) or T3levels by radioimmunoassay. T3resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T4and free T3concentrations are unaltered. Patients on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone. 
 *  3.Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum (i.e., corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG)) leading to increased total circulating corticosteroids and sex steroids, respectively. Free hormone concentrations may be decreased. Other plasma proteins may be increased (angiotensinogen/renin substrate, alpha-1-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin). 
 *  4.Increased plasma HDL and HDL2cholesterol subfraction concentrations, reduced LDL cholesterol concentration, increased triglycerides levels. 
 *  5.Impaired glucose tolerance. 
 *  6.Reduced response to metyrapone test. 
       E. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility
 

  Long-term continuous administration of estrogen, with and without progestin, in women with and without a uterus, has shown an increased risk of endometrial cancer, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer. (See BOXED WARNINGS,  WARNINGS    and   PRECAUTIONS    ).



 Long-term continuous administration of natural and synthetic estrogens in certain animal species increases the frequency of carcinomas of the breast, uterus, cervix, vagina, testis, and liver.



    F. Pregnancy



  DELESTROGEN should not be used during pregnancy. (See   CONTRAINDICATIONS    ).



    G. Nursing Mothers



  Estrogen administration to nursing mothers has been shown to decrease the quantity and quality of the milk. Detectable amounts of estrogens have been identified in the milk of mothers receiving this drug. Caution should be exercised when DELESTROGEN is administered to a nursing woman.



    H. Pediatric Use



  Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Large and repeated doses of estrogen over an extended period of time may accelerate epiphyseal closure. Therefore, periodic monitoring of bone maturation and effects on epiphyseal centers is recommended in patients in whom bone growth is not complete.



    I. Geriatric Use



  Clinical studies of estradiol valerate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.



 In the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study, including 4,532 women 65 years of age and older, followed for an average of 4 years, 82% (n = 3,729) were 65 to 74 while 18% (n = 803) were 75 and over. Most women (80%) had no prior hormone therapy use. Women treated with conjugated estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone acetate were reported to have a two-fold increase in the risk of developing probable dementia. Alzheimer's disease was the most common classification of probable dementia in both the conjugated estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone acetate group and the placebo group. Ninety percent of the cases of probable dementia occurred in the 54% of the women that were older than 70. (See   WARNINGS, Dementia    ).



 It is unknown whether these findings apply to estrogen alone therapy.
</Section>
    <Section id="S4" name="warnings">    WARNINGS



  See BOXED WARNINGS.  



 The use of unopposed estrogens in women who have a uterus is associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer.



    1. Cardiovascular disorders



  Estrogen and estrogen/progestin therapy has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke, as well as venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (venous thromboembolism or VTE). Should any of these occur or be suspected, estrogens should be discontinued immediately.



 Risk factors for arterial vascular disease (e.g., hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) and/or venous thromboembolism (e.g., personal history or family history of VTE, obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus) should be managed appropriately.



      a. Coronary heart disease and stroke    



  In the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study, an increase in the number of myocardial infarctions and strokes has been observed in women receiving CE compared to placebo. These observations are preliminary. (See   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies    ).



 In the CE/MPA substudy of WHI, an increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) events (defined as non-fatal myocardial infarction and CHD death) was observed in women receiving CE/MPA compared to women receiving placebo (37 vs. 30 per 10,000 women-years). The increase in risk was observed in year one and persisted.



 In the same substudy of WHI, an increased risk of stroke was observed in women receiving CE/MPA compared to women receiving placebo (29 vs. 21 per 10,000 women-years). The increase in risk was observed after the first year and persisted.



 In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease (n=2,763, average age 66.7 years) a controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study; HERS) treatment with CE/MPA (0.625mg/2.5mg per day) demonstrated no cardiovascular benefit. During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with CE/MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary heart disease. There were more CHD events in the CE/MPA-treated group than in the placebo group in year 1, but not during the subsequent years. Two thousand three hundred and twenty one women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open label extension of HERS, HERS II. Average follow-up in HERS II was an additional 2.7 years, for a total of 6.8 years overall. Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CE/MPA group and the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, and overall.



 Large doses of estrogen (5 mg conjugated estrogens per day), comparable to those used to treat cancer of the prostate and breast, have been shown in a large prospective clinical trial in men to increase the risks of nonfatal myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and thrombophlebitis.



      b. Venous thromboembolism (VTE)    



  In the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study, an increase in VTE has been observed in women receiving CE compared to placebo. These observations are preliminary. (See   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies    .)



 In the CE/MPA substudy of WHI, a 2-fold greater rate of VTE, including deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, was observed in women receiving CE/MPA compared to women receiving placebo. The rate of VTE was 34 per 10,000 women-years in the CE/MPA group compared to 16 per 10,000 women-years in the placebo group. The increase in VTE risk was observed during the first year and persisted.



 If feasible, estrogens should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization.



    2. Malignant neoplasms



     a. Endometrial cancer    



  The use of unopposed estrogens in women with intact uteri has been associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2- to 12-fold greater than in non-users, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with use of estrogens for less than one year. The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold for five to ten years or more and this risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued.



 Clinical surveillance of all women taking estrogen/progestin combinations is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in all cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding. There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer.



      b. Breast cancer    



  The use of estrogens and progestins by postmenopausal women has been reported to increase the risk of breast cancer. The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about this issue is the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) substudy of CE/MPA (see   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies    ). The results from observational studies are generally consistent with those of the WHI clinical trial and report no significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogens or progestins, doses, or routes of administration.



 The CE/MPA substudy of WHI reported an increased risk of breast cancer in women who took CE/MPA for a mean follow-up of 5.6 years. Observational studies have also reported an increased risk for estrogen/progestin combination hormone therapy, and a smaller increased risk for estrogen alone therapy, after several years of use. In the WHI trial and from observational studies, the excess risk increased with duration of use. From observational studies, the risk appeared to return to baseline in about five years after stopping treatment. In addition, observational studies suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen/progestin combination therapy as compared to estrogen alone therapy.



 In the CE/MPA substudy, 26% of the women reported prior use of estrogen alone and/or estrogen/progestin combination therapy. After a mean follow-up of 5.6 years during the clinical trial, the overall relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24 (95% confidence interval 1.01-1.54), and the overall absolute risk was 41 vs. 33 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE/MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 vs. 25 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE/MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09, and the absolute risk was 40 vs. 36 cases per 10,000 women-years for CE/MPA compared with placebo. In the same substudy, invasive breast cancers were larger and diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE/MPA group compared with the placebo group. Metastatic disease was rare with no apparent difference between the two groups. Other prognostic factors such as histologic subtype, grade and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups.



 The use of estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results.



    c. Ovarian cancer



  The CE/MPA substudy of WHI reported that estrogen plus progestin increased the risk of ovarian cancer. After an average follow-up of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CE/MPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95% confidence interval 0.77 - 3.24) but was not statistically significant. The absolute risk for CE/MPA versus placebo was 4.2 versus 2.7 cases per 10,000 women-years.



  A meta-analysis of 17 prospective and 35 retrospective epidemiology studies found that women who used hormonal therapy for menopausal symptoms had an increased risk for ovarian cancer.  The primary analysis, using case-control comparisons, included 12,110 cancer cases from the 17 prospective studies.  The relative risks associated with current use of hormonal therapy was 1.41 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32 to 1.50); there was no difference in the risk estimates by duration of the exposure (less than 5 years [median of 3 years] vs. greater than 5 years [median of 10 years] of use before the cancer diagnosis).  The relative risk associated with combined current and recent use (discontinued use within 5 years before cancer diagnosis) was 1.37 (95% CI 1.27-1.48), and the elevated risk was significant for both estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin products.  The exact duration of hormone therapy use associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer, however, is unknown.  
 

    3. Dementia



  In the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS), 4,532 generally healthy postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older were studied, of whom 35% were 70 to 74 years of age and 18% were 75 or older. After an average follow-up of 4 years, 40 women being treated with CE/MPA (1.8%, n = 2,229) and 21 women in the placebo group (0.9%, n = 2,303) received diagnoses of probable dementia. The relative risk for CE/MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95% confidence interval 1.21 - 3.48), and was similar for women with and without histories of menopausal hormone use before WHIMS. The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE/MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10,000 women-years, and the absolute excess risk for CE/MPA was 23 cases per 10,000 women-years. It is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women. (See   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies    and   PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use    ).



 It is unknown whether these findings apply to estrogen alone therapy.



    4. Gallbladder disease



  A 2- to 4-fold increase in the risk of gallbladder disease requiring surgery in postmenopausal women receiving estrogens has been reported.



    5. Hypercalcemia



  Estrogen administration may lead to severe hypercalcemia in patients with breast cancer and bone metastases. If hypercalcemia occurs, use of the drug should be stopped and appropriate measures taken to reduce the serum calcium level.



    6. Visual abnormalities



  Retinal vascular thrombosis has been reported in patients receiving estrogens. Discontinue medication pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine. If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions, estrogens should be permanently discontinued.
