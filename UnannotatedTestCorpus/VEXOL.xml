  Reactions associated with ophthalmic steroids include elevated intraocular pressure, which may be associated with optic nerve damage, visual acuity and field defects, posterior subcapsular cataract formation, secondary ocular infection from pathogens including herpes simplex, and perforation of the globe where there is thinning of the cornea or sclera.



 Ocular adverse reactions occurring in 1 - 5% of patients in clinical studies of VEXOL(r) 1% (rimexolone ophthalmic suspension) included blurred vision, discharge, discomfort, ocular pain, increased intraocular pressure, foreign body sensation, hyperemia and pruritus.



 Other ocular adverse reactions occurring in less than 1% of patients included sticky sensation, increased fibrin, dry eye, conjunctival edema, corneal staining, keratitis, tearing, photophobia, edema, irritation, corneal ulcer, browache, lid margin crusting, corneal edema, infiltrate, and corneal erosion.



 Non-ocular adverse reactions occurred in less than 2% of patients. These included headache, hypotension, rhinitis, pharyngitis, and taste perversion.

   General



  Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term local steroid application. Fungal invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where a steroid has been or is in use.



 For ophthalmic use only. Use of the same bottle for both eyes is not recommended with topical eye drops that are used in association with surgery.



 The initial prescription and renewal of the medication order beyond 14 days should be made by a physician only after examination of the patient with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and where appropriate, fluorescein staining. If signs and symptoms fail to improve after two days, the patient should be reevaluated.



 If this product is used for 10 days or longer, intraocular pressure should be monitored even though it may be difficult in children and uncooperative patients (see   WARNINGS    ).



    Information for Patients



  Do not touch dropper tip to any surface, as this may contaminate the suspension.



    Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility



  Rimexolone has been shown to be non-mutagenic in a battery of in vitro  and in vivo  mutagenicity assays.



 Fertility and reproductive capability were not impaired in a study in rats with plasma levels (42 ng/mL) approximately 200 times those obtained in clinical studies after topical administration (&lt;0.2 ng/mL). Long-term studies have not been conducted in animals or humans to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of rimexolone.



    Pregnancy



  Pregnancy Category C. Rimexolone has been shown to be teratogenic and embryotoxic in rabbits following subcutaneous administration at the lowest dose tested (0.5 mg/kg/day, approximately 2 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose). Corticosteroids are recognized to cause fetal resorptions and malformations in animals. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. VEXOL(r) 1% (rimexolone ophthalmic suspension) should be used in pregnant women only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus.



    Nursing Mothers



  It is not known whether topical ophthalmic administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human breast milk. Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when topical corticosteroids are administered to a nursing woman; a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue therapy, taking into consideration the importance of the drug to the mother.



    Pediatric Use



  Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.



    Geriatric Use



  No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients.

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings">    WARNINGS



  FOR TOPICAL OPHTHALMIC USE ONLY. Not for injection. Use in the treatment of herpes simplex infection requires great caution and frequent slit-lamp examinations. Prolonged use may result in ocular hypertension/glaucoma, damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and visual fields, and posterior subcapsular cataract formation.



 Prolonged use may also result in secondary ocular infections due to suppression of host response.



 Acute purulent infections of the eye may be masked or exacerbated by the presence of corticosteroid medication. In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforation has been known to occur with topical steroids. It is advisable that the intraocular pressure be checked frequently.
