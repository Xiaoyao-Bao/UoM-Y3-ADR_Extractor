  The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label:



 *    Serious Infusion Reactions [ see Boxed Warning and   Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .  
 *    Prolonged and Severe Cytopenias [ see Boxed Warning and  Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. 
 *    Severe Cutaneous and Mucocutaneous Reactions [ see Boxed Warning and  Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. 
 *    Leukemia and Myelodysplastic Syndrome [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. 
    The most common adverse reactions of Zevalin are cytopenias, fatigue, nasopharyngitis, nausea, abdominal pain, asthenia, cough, diarrhea, and pyrexia.
 

 The most serious adverse reactions of Zevalin are prolonged and severe cytopenias (thrombocytopenia, anemia, lymphopenia, neutropenia) and secondary malignancies.



 Because the Zevalin therapeutic regimen includes the use of rituximab, see prescribing information for rituximab.



   EXCERPT:   Common adverse reactions (  &gt;  10%) in clinical trials were: cytopenias, fatigue, nasopharyngitis, nausea, abdominal pain, asthenia, cough, diarrhea, and pyrexia. (6)

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The reported safety data reflects exposure to Zevalin in 349 patients with relapsed or refractory, low-grade, follicular or transformed NHL across 5 trials (4 single arm and 1 randomized) and in 206 patients with previously untreated follicular NHL in a randomized trial (Study 4) who received any portion of the Zevalin therapeutic regimen. The safety data reflect exposure to Zevalin in 270 patients with relapsed or refractory NHL with platelet counts &gt;=150,000/ mm  3  who received 0.4 mCi/kg (14.8 MBq/kg) of Y-90 Zevalin (Group 1 in Table 4), 65 patients with relapsed or refractory NHL with platelet counts of &gt;= 100,000 but &lt;= 149,000 /mm  3  who received 0.3 mCi/kg (11.1 MBq/kg) of Y-90 Zevalin (Group 2 in Table 4), and 204 patients with previously untreated NHL with platelet counts &gt;=150,000/ mm  3  who received 0.4 mCi/kg (14.8 MBq/kg) of Y-90 Zevalin; all patients received a single course of Zevalin.



 Table 2 displays selected adverse reaction incidence rates in patients who received any portion of the Zevalin therapeutic regimen (n=206) or no further therapy (n=203) following first-line chemotherapy (Study 4).

          Cytopenias were more severe and more prolonged among eleven (5%) patients who received Zevalin after first-line fludarabine or a fludarabine-containing chemotherapy regimen as compared to patients receiving non-fludarabine-containing regimens. Among these eleven patients, the median platelet nadir was 13,000/mm  3  with a median duration of platelets below 50,000/mm  3  of 56 days and the median time for platelet recovery from nadir to Grade 1 toxicity or baseline was 35 days. The median ANC was 355/mm  3  , with a median duration of ANC below 1,000/mm  3  of 37 days and the median time for ANC recovery from nadir to Grade 1 toxicity or baseline was 20 days.
 

 The median time to cytopenia was similar across patients with relapsed/refractory NHL and those completing first-line chemotherapy, with median ANC nadir at 61-62 days, platelet nadir at 49-53 days, and hemoglobin nadir at 68-69 days after Y-90-Zevalin administration.



 Information on hematopoietic growth factor use and platelet transfusions is based on 211 patients with relapsed/refractory NHL and 206 patients following first-line chemotherapy. Filgrastim was given to 13% of patients and erythropoietin to 8% with relapsed or refractory disease; 14% of patients receiving Zevalin following first-line chemotherapy received granulocyte-colony stimulating factors and 5% received erythopoiesis-stimulating agents. Platelet transfusions were given to approximately 22% of all Zevalin-treated patients. Red blood cell transfusions were given to 20% of patients with relapsed or refractory NHL and 2% of patients receiving Zevalin following first-line chemotherapy.



   Infections  



 In relapsed or refractory NHL patients, infections occurred in 29% of 349 patients during the first 3 months after initiating the Zevalin therapeutic regimen and 3% developed serious infections (urinary tract infection, febrile neutropenia, sepsis, pneumonia, cellulitis, colitis, diarrhea, osteomyelitis, and upper respiratory tract infection). Life-threatening infections were reported in 2% (sepsis, empyema, pneumonia, febrile neutropenia, fever, and biliary stent-associated cholangitis). From 3 months to 4 years after Zevalin treatment, 6% of patients developed infections; 2% were serious (urinary tract infection, bacterial or viral pneumonia, febrile neutropenia, perihilar infiltrate, pericarditis, and intravenous drug-associated viral hepatitis) and 1% were life-threatening infections (bacterial pneumonia, respiratory disease, and sepsis).



 When administered following first-line chemotherapy (Table 2), Grade 3-4 infections occurred in 8% of Zevalin treated patients and in 2% of controls and included neutropenic sepsis (1%), bronchitis, catheter sepsis, diverticulitis, herpes zoster, influenza, lower respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, and upper respiratory tract infection.



   Leukemia and Myelodysplastic Syndrome  



 Among 746 patients with relapsed/refractory NHL, 19 (2.6%) patients developed MDS/AML with a median follow-up of 4.4 years. The overall incidence of MDS/AML among the 211 patients included in the clinical studies was 5.2% (11/211), with a median follow-up of 6.5 years and median time to development of MDS/AML of 2.9 years. The cumulative Kaplan-Meier estimated incidence of MDS/secondary leukemia in this patient population was 2.2% at 2 years and 5.9% at 5 years. The incidence of MDS/AML among the 535 patients in the expanded access programs was 1.5% (8/535) with a median follow-up of 4.4 years and median time to development of MDS/AML of 1.5 years. Multiple cytogenetic abnormalities were described, most commonly involving chromosomes 5 and/or 7. The risk of MDS/AML was not associated with the number of prior treatments (0-1 versus 2-10).



 Among 204 patients receiving Y-90-Zevalin following first-line treatment, 7 (3%) patients developed MDS/AML between approximately 2 and 7 years after Zevalin administration [  see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)  ].



   6.2 Post-Marketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of the Zevalin therapeutic regimen in hematologic malignancies. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to the Zevalin therapeutic regimen.



 *  1.  Cutaneous and mucocutaneous reactions: erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, bullous dermatitis, and exfoliative dermatitis [ see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. 
 *  2.  Infusion site erythema and ulceration following extravasation [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. 
 *  3.  Radiation injury in tissues near areas of lymphomatous involvement within a month of Zevalin administration. 
      6.3 Immunogenicity
   As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. The incidence of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparisons of the incidence of HAMA/HACA to the Zevalin therapeutic regimen with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.



 HAMA and HACA response data on 446 patients from 8 clinical studies conducted over a 10-year time period are available. Overall, 11/446 (2.5%) had evidence of either HAMA formation (N=8) or HACA formation (N=4). Six of these patients developed HAMA/HACA after treatment with Zevalin and 5 were HAMA/HACA positive at baseline. Of the 6 who were HAMA/HACA positive, only one was positive for both. Furthermore, in 6 of the 11 patients, the HAMA/HACA reverted to negative within 2 weeks to 3 months. No patients had increasing levels of HAMA/HACA at the end of the studies.



 Only 6/446 patients (1.3%) had developed evidence of antibody formation after treatment with Zevalin, and of these, many either reverted to negative or decreased over time. This data demonstrates that HAMA/HACA develop infrequently, are typically transient, and do not increase with time.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: SERIOUS INFUSION REACTIONS, PROLONGED AND SEVERE CYTOPENIAS, and SEVERE CUTANEOUS AND MUCOCUTANEOUS REACTIONS

  WARNING: SERIOUS INFUSION REACTIONS, PROLONGED AND SEVERE CYTOPENIAS, and SEVERE CUTANEOUS AND MUCOCUTANEOUS REACTIONS

    Serious Infusion Reactions: Deaths have occurred within 24 hours of rituximab infusion, an essential component of the Zevalin therapeutic regimen. These fatalities were associated with hypoxia, pulmonary infiltrates, acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation, or cardiogenic shock. Most (80%) fatalities occurred with the first rituximab infusion   [  see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)   and   Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].    Discontinue rituximab and Y-90 Zevalin infusions in patients who develop severe infusion reactions.  



   Prolonged and Severe Cytopenias: Y-90 Zevalin administration results in severe and prolonged cytopenias in most patients. Do not administer Y-90 Zevalin to patients with &gt;= 25% lymphoma marrow involvement and/or impaired bone marrow reserve   [  see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)   and   Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].



   Severe Cutaneous and Mucocutaneous Reactions: Severe cutaneous and mucocutaneous reactions, some fatal, can occur with the Zevalin therapeutic regimen. Discontinue rituximab and Y-90 Zevalin infusions in patients experiencing severe cutaneous or mucocutaneous reactions   [  see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)   and   Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ].



   Dosing: The dose of Y-90 Zevalin should not exceed 32.0 mCi (1184 MBq)   [  see Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ].

   5.1 Serious Infusion Reactions



  See also prescribing information for rituximab.



 Rituximab, alone or as a component of the Zevalin therapeutic regimen, can cause severe, including fatal, infusion reactions. These reactions typically occur during the first rituximab infusion with time to onset of 30 to 120 minutes. Signs and symptoms of severe infusion reactions may include urticaria, hypotension, angioedema, hypoxia, bronchospasm, pulmonary infiltrates, acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation, and cardiogenic shock. Temporarily slow or interrupt the rituximab infusion for less severe infusion reactions. Immediately discontinue rituximab and Y-90 Zevalin administration for severe infusion reactions. Only administer Rituxan/Zevalin in facilities where immediate access to resuscitative measures is available [ see Boxed Warning  and Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ].



    5.2 Prolonged and Severe Cytopenias



  Cytopenias with delayed onset and prolonged duration, some complicated by hemorrhage and severe infection, are the most common severe adverse reactions of the Zevalin therapeutic regimen. When used according to recommended doses, the incidences of severe thrombocytopenia and neutropenia are greater in patients with mild baseline thrombocytopenia (&gt;= 100,000 but &lt;= 149,000 /mm  3  ) compared to those with normal pretreatment platelet counts. Severe cytopenias persisting more than 12 weeks following administration can occur. Monitor complete blood counts (CBC) and platelet counts following the Zevalin therapeutic regimen weekly until levels recover or as clinically indicated [ see Boxed Warning  and Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].



 Do not administer the Zevalin therapeutic regimen to patients with &gt;= 25% lymphoma marrow involvement and/or impaired bone marrow reserve. Monitor patients for cytopenias and their complications (e.g., febrile neutropenia, hemorrhage) for up to 3 months after use of the Zevalin therapeutic regimen. Avoid using drugs which interfere with platelet function or coagulation following the Zevalin therapeutic regimen.



    5.3 Severe Cutaneous and Mucocutaneous Reactions



  Erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, bullous dermatitis, and exfoliative dermatitis, some fatal, were reported in post-marketing experience. The time to onset of these reactions was variable, ranging from a few days to 4 months after administration of the Zevalin therapeutic regimen. Discontinue the Zevalin therapeutic regimen in patients experiencing a severe cutaneous or mucocutaneous reaction [ see Boxed Warning  and Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ].



    5.4 Altered Biodistribution



  In a post-marketing registry designed to collect biodistribution images and other information in reported cases of altered biodistribution, there were 12 (1.3%) patients reported to have altered biodistribution among 953 patients registered.



    5.5 Risk of Developing Myelodysplastic Syndrome, Leukemia, and Other Malignancies



  The radiation dose resulting from therapeutic exposure to Y-90 radiolabeled Zevalin may result in secondary malignancies.



 Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and/or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were reported in 5.2% (11/211) of patients with relapsed or refractory NHL enrolled in clinical studies and 1.5% (8/535) of patients included in the expanded-access trial, with median follow-up of 6.5 and 4.4 years, respectively. Among the 19 reported cases, the median time to the diagnosis of MDS or AML was 1.9 years following treatment with the Zevalin therapeutic regimen; however, the cumulative incidence continues to increase [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].



 Among 204 patients receiving Y-90 Zevalin following first-line chemotherapy, 26 (12.7%) patients in the Zevalin arm developed a second primary malignancy compared to 14 (6.8%) of patients in the control arm. Seven patients (3.4%, 7/204) were diagnosed with MDS/AML after receiving Zevalin, compared to one patient (0.5%, 1/205) in the control arm, with a median follow-up of 7.3 years. Deaths due to second primary malignancy included 8 (3.9%) patients in the Zevalin arm compared to 3 (1.5%) patients in the control arm. Deaths due to MDS/AML included five (2.5%) patients in the Zevalin arm compared to no patients in the control arm.



    5.6 Extravasation



  Monitor patients closely for evidence of extravasation during Zevalin infusion. Immediately terminate the infusion if signs or symptoms of extravasation occur and restart in another limb  [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ] .  



    5.7 Risks of Immunization



  The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines following the Zevalin therapeutic regimen has not been studied. Do not administer live viral vaccines to patients who have recently received Zevalin. The ability to generate an immune response to any vaccine following the Zevalin therapeutic regimen has not been studied.



    5.8 Radionuclide Precautions



  During and after radiolabeling Zevalin with Y-90, minimize radiation exposure to patients and to medical personnel, consistent with institutional good radiation safety practices and patient management procedures.



    5.9 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  Based on its radioactivity, Y-90 Zevalin may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If the Zevalin therapeutic regimen is administered during pregnancy, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. Advise women of childbearing potential to use adequate contraception for a minimum of twelve months [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ].
