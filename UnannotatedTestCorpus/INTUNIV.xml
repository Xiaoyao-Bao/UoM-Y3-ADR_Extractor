  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The data described below reflect clinical trial exposure to INTUNIV  (r)  in 2,825 patients. This includes 2,330 patients from completed studies in children and adolescents, ages 6 to 17 years and 495 patients in completed studies in adult healthy volunteers.



 The mean duration of exposure of 446 patients that previously participated in two 2-year, open-label long-term studies was approximately 10 months.

               Effects on Blood Pressure and Heart Rate  
 

 In the monotherapy pediatric, short-term, controlled trials (Studies 1 and 2), the maximum mean changes from baseline in seated systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and pulse were -5.4 mmHg, -3.4 mmHg, and -5.5 bpm, respectively, for all doses combined (generally one week after reaching target doses). For the respective fixed doses 1 mg/day, 2 mg/day, 3 mg/day or 4 mg/day the maximum mean changes in seated systolic blood pressure were -4.3 mmHg, -5.5 mmHg, -5.4 mmHg and -8.2 mmHg. For these respective fixed doses the maximum mean changes in seated diastolic blood pressure were -3.4 mmHg, -3.3 mmHg, -4.4 mmHg and -5.4 mmHg. For these respective fixed doses the maximum mean changes in seated pulse were -4.8 bpm, -3.1 bpm, -6.5 bpm and -8.6 bpm. Decreases in blood pressure and heart rate were usually modest and asymptomatic; however, hypotension and bradycardia can occur. Hypotension was reported as an adverse reaction for 7% of the INTUNIV  (r)  group and 3% of the placebo group. This includes orthostatic hypotension, which was reported for 1% of the INTUNIV  (r)  group and none in the placebo group. These findings were generally similar in the monotherapy flexible dose trials (Studies 4 and 5). In the adjunctive trial, hypotension (3%) and bradycardia (2%) were observed in patients treated with INTUNIV  (r)  as compared to none in the placebo group. In long-term, open-label studies, (mean exposure of approximately 10 months), maximum decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure occurred in the first month of therapy. Decreases were less pronounced over time. Syncope occurred in 1% of pediatric patients in the clinical program. The majority of these cases occurred in the long-term, open-label studies.



     Discontinuation of Treatment  



 Blood pressure and pulse may increase above baseline values following discontinuation of INTUNIV  (r)  . In five studies of children and adolescents  [see  Clinical Studies (14)  ]  , increases in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure averaging approximately 3 mmHg and increases in heart rate averaging 5 beats per minute above original baseline were observed upon discontinuation with tapering of INTUNIV  +  . In a maintenance of efficacy study, increases in blood pressure and heart rate above baseline slowly diminished over the follow up period, which ranged between 3 and 26 weeks post final dose; the estimated average time to return to baseline was between six and twelve months. In this study, the increases in blood pressure and pulse were not considered serious or associated with adverse events. However, individuals may have larger increases than reflected by the mean changes.



 In postmarketing experience, following abrupt discontinuation of INTUNIV  (r)  , rebound hypertension and hypertensive encephalopathy have been reported  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.4)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ]  .



     Effects on Height, Weight, and Body Mass Index (BMI)  



 Patients taking INTUNIV  (r)  demonstrated similar growth compared to normative data. Patients taking INTUNIV  (r)  had a mean increase in weight of 0.5 kg compared to those receiving placebo over a comparable treatment period. Patients receiving INTUNIV  (r)  for at least 12 months in open-label studies gained an average of 8 kg in weight and 8 cm (3 in) in height. The height, weight, and BMI percentile remained stable in patients at 12 months in the long-term studies compared to when they began receiving INTUNIV  (r)  .

          6.2 Postmarketing Experience
   The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of guanfacine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 Less frequent, possibly guanfacine-related events observed in the post-marketing study and/or reported spontaneously, not included in section 6.1, include:



   General:  edema, malaise, tremor



   Cardiovascular:  palpitations, tachycardia, rebound hypertension, hypertensive encephalopathy



   Central Nervous System:  paresthesias, vertigo



   Eye Disorders:  blurred vision



   Musculo-Skeletal System:  arthralgia, leg cramps, leg pain, myalgia



   Psychiatric:  confusion, hallucinations



   Reproductive System, Male:  erectile dysfunction



   Respiratory System:  dyspnea



   Skin and Appendages:  alopecia, dermatitis, exfoliative dermatitis, pruritus, rash

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Hypotension, bradycardia, syncope: Titrate slowly and monitor vital signs frequently in patients at risk for hypotension, heart block, bradycardia, syncope, cardiovascular disease, vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease or chronic renal failure. Measure heart rate and blood pressure prior to initiation of therapy, following dose increases, and periodically while on therapy. Avoid concomitant use of drugs with additive effects unless clinically indicated. Advise patients to avoid becoming dehydrated or overheated (  5.1  ). 
 *  Sedation and somnolence: Occur commonly with INTUNIV   (r)   . Consider the potential for additive sedative effects with CNS depressant drugs. Caution patients against operating heavy equipment or driving until they know how they respond to INTUNIV   (r)   (  5.2  ). 
 *  Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities: May worsen sinus node dysfunction and atrioventricular (AV) block, especially in patients taking other sympatholytic drugs. Titrate slowly and monitor vital signs frequently (  5.3  ). 
 *  Rebound Hypertension: Abrupt discontinuation of INTUNIV  (r)  can lead to clinically significant and persistent rebound hypertension. Subsequent hypertensive encephalopathy was also reported. To minimize the risk of rebound hypertension upon discontinuation, the total daily dose of INTUNIV  (r)  should be tapered in decrements of no more than 1 mg every 3 to 7 days (  5.4  ). 
    
 

   5.1 Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope



  Treatment with INTUNIV  (r)  can cause dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure and heart rate. Decreases were less pronounced over time of treatment. Orthostatic hypotension and syncope have been reported [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



 Measure heart rate and blood pressure prior to initiation of therapy, following dose increases, and periodically while on therapy. Titrate INTUNIV slowly in patients with a history of hypotension, and those with underlying conditions that may be worsened by hypotension and bradycardia; e.g., heart block, bradycardia, cardiovascular disease, vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, or chronic renal failure. In patients who have a history of syncope or may have a condition that predisposes them to syncope, such as hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, or dehydration, advise patients to avoid becoming dehydrated or overheated. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate, and adjust dosages accordingly in patients treated concomitantly with antihypertensives or other drugs that can reduce blood pressure or heart rate or increase the risk of syncope.



    5.2 Sedation and Somnolence



  Somnolence and sedation were commonly reported adverse reactions in clinical studies [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Before using INTUNIV  (r)  with other centrally active depressants, consider the potential for additive sedative effects. Caution patients against operating heavy equipment or driving until they know how they respond to treatment with INTUNIV  (r)   .  Advise patients to avoid use with alcohol.



    5.3 Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities



  The sympatholytic action of INTUNIV  (r)  may worsen sinus node dysfunction and atrioventricular (AV) block, especially in patients taking other sympatholytic drugs. Titrate INTUNIV slowly and monitor vital signs frequently in patients with cardiac conduction abnormalities or patients concomitantly treated with other sympatholytic drugs.



    5.4 Rebound Hypertension



   In post marketing experience, abrupt discontinuation of INTUNIV  (r)  has resulted in clinically significant and persistent rebound hypertension above baseline levels and increases in heart rate. Hypertensive encephalopathy has also been reported in association with rebound hypertension with both INTUNIV  (r)  and immediate release guanfacine [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ]  . In these cases, high-dosage guanfacine was discontinued; concomitant stimulant use was also reported, which may potentially increase hypertensive response upon abrupt discontinuation of guanfacine. Children commonly have gastrointestinal illnesses that lead to vomiting, and a resulting inability to take medications, so they may be especially at risk for rebound hypertension.  



  To minimize the risk of rebound hypertension upon discontinuation, the total daily dose of INTUNIV  (r)  should be tapered in decrements of no more than 1 mg every 3 to 7 days [see  Dosage and Administration (2.5)  ]  . Blood pressure and heart rate should be monitored when reducing the dose or discontinuing INTUNIV  (r)  . If abrupt discontinuation occurs (especially with concomitant stimulant use), patients should be closely followed for rebound hypertension.
