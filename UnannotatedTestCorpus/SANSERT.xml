  Within the recommended dose levels, the following side effects have been reported:



     1)          Fibrotic Complications  

  Fibrotic changes have been observed in the retroperitoneal, pleuropulmonary, cardiac, and other tissues, either singly or, very rarely, in combination.



     Retroperitoneal Fibrosis  

  This nonspecific fibrotic process is usually confined to the retroperitoneal connective tissue above the pelvic brim and may present clinically with one or more symptoms such as general malaise, fatigue, weight loss, backache, low grade fever (elevated sedimentation rate), urinary obstruction (girdle or flank pain, dysuria, polyuria, oliguria, elevated BUN), vascular insufficiency of the lower limbs (leg pain, Leriche syndrome, edema of legs, thrombophlebitis). The single most useful diagnostic procedure in suspected cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis is intravenous pyelography. Typical deviation and obstruction of one or both ureters may be observed.



     Pleuropulmonary Complications  

  A similar nonspecific fibrotic process, limited to the pleural and immediately subjacent pulmonary tissues, usually presents clinically with dyspnea, tightness and pain in the chest, pleural friction rubs, and pleural effusion. These findings may be confirmed by chest X-ray.



     Cardiac Complications  

  Nonrheumatic fibrotic thickenings of the aortic root and of the aortic and mitral valves usually present clinically with cardiac murmurs and dyspnea.



     Other Fibrotic Complications  

  Several cases of fibrotic plaques, simulating Peyronie's Disease have been described.



     2)          Cardiovascular Complications  

  Encroachment of retroperitoneal fibrosis on the aorta, inferior vena cava and their common iliac branches may result in vascular insufficiency of the lower limbs, the presenting features of which are mentioned under  Retroperitoneal Fibrosis.  



 



 Intrinsic vasoconstriction of large and small arteries, involving one or more vessels or merely a segment of a vessel, may occur at any stage of therapy. Depending on the vessel involved, this complication may present with chest pain, abdominal pain, or cold, numb, painful extremities with or without paresthesias and diminished or absent pulses. Progression to ischemic tissue damage has rarely been reported. Prompt withdrawal of the drug at the first signs of impaired circulation is recommended  (see WARNINGS)  to obviate such effects.



 



 Postural hypotension and tachycardia have also been observed.



     3)          Gastrointestinal Symptoms  

  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, heartburn, abdominal pain. These effects tend to appear early and can frequently be obviated by gradual introduction of the medication and by administration of the drug with meals. Constipation and elevation of gastric HCl have also been reported.



     4)          CNS Symptoms  

  Seizure, insomnia, drowsiness, mild euphoria, dizziness, ataxia, lightheadedness, hyperesthesia, unworldly feelings (described variously as "dissociation", "hallucinatory experiences", etc.). Some of these symptoms may be associated with vascular headaches, per se, and may, therefore, be unrelated to the drug.



     5)          Dermatological Manifestations  

  Facial flush, telangiectasia, and nonspecific rashes have rarely been reported. Increased hair loss may occur, but in many instances the tendency has abated despite continued therapy.



     6)          Edema  

  Peripheral edema, and, more rarely, localized brawny edema may occur.



 Dependent edema has responded to lowered doses, salt restriction, or diuretics.



     7)          Weight Gain  

  Weight gain may be a reason to caution patients regarding their caloric intake.



     8)          Hematological Manifestations  

  Neutropenia, eosinophilia, and thrombocytopenia.



     9)          Miscellaneous  

  Weakness, arthralgia, myalgia, fever, and mydriasis.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING

    WARNING  

    Retroperitoneal Fibrosis, Pleuropulmonary Fibrosis and Fibrotic Thickening of Cardiac Valves May Occur in Patients Receiving Long-term Methysergide Maleate Therapy. Therefore, This Preparation Must Be Reserved for Prophylaxis in Patients Whose Vascular Headaches Are Frequent and/or Severe and Uncontrollable and Who Are Under Close Medical Supervision.    (See also WARNINGS section)  
</Section>
    <Section id="S3" name="precautions">     PRECAUTIONS  



      General  



  All patients receiving Sansert  (r)  (methysergide maleate) should remain under constant supervision of the physician and be examined regularly for the development of fibrotic or vascular complications. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS)  



 



 The manifestations of retroperitoneal fibrosis, pleuropulmonary fibrosis, and vascular shutdown have shown a high incidence of regression once Sansert  (r)  (methysergide maleate) is withdrawn. These facts should be borne in mind to avoid unnecessary surgical intervention. Cardiac murmurs, which may indicate endocardial fibrosis, have shown varying degrees of regression, with complete disappearance in some and persistence in others.



 



 Sansert  (r)  (methysergide maleate) has been specifically designed for the prophylaxis of vascular headache and has no place in the management of the acute attack.



 



 Sansert  (r)  (methysergide maleate) tablets contain FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible individuals. Although the overall incidence of FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general population is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity.



 



     Information for Patients  



  Sansert  (r)  (methysergide maleate) is intended for use as a preventive agent in the treatment of vascular headaches. It should not be used for acute migraine attacks. If, after a 3-week trial period, Sansert  (r)  (methysergide maleate) has not been effective in decreasing the frequency or intensity of headaches, it is unlikely that longer administration of Sansert  (r)  (methysergide maleate) will be beneficial.



 



 Patients should be advised to report the following symptoms immediately and to discontinue the drug: cold, numb, and painful hands and feet; leg cramps on walking; any type of girdle, flank, or chest pain; shortness of breath; or any associated symptomatology. There must be a drug-free interval of 3-4 weeks after each 6-month course of treatment.



 



 Sansert  (r)  (methysergide maleate) should be taken with meals. Weight gain may necessitate modification of diet.



 



     Drug Interactions  



  Methysergide may reverse the analgesic activity of narcotic analgesics. Concurrent use with vasoconstrictor agents including ergot alkaloids, sumatriptan, and nicotine (e.g. smoking) may result in enhanced vasoconstriction.



     Pregnancy Category X  



  Sansert  (r)  (methysergide maleate) is contraindicated in pregnancy due to its oxytocic actions.



     Nursing Mothers  



  There are no specific studies on the use of Sansert  (r)  (methysergide maleate) in nursing mothers. Ergot alkaloids, in general, appear in mothers' milk.



 



 Sansert  (r)  (methysergide maleate) is a semi-synthetic compound structurally related to ergotamine, and thus it may appear in breast milk. Ergot alkaloids have been reported to cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and weakness in the nursing infant and suppression of prolactin secretion and lactation in the mother.



 



 Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Sansert  (r)  (methysergide maleate), a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.



     Pediatric Use  



  Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.

    <Section id="S4" name="warnings">     WARNINGS  



  With long-term, uninterrupted administration, retroperitoneal fibrosis or related conditions - pleuropulmonary fibrosis and cardiovascular disorders with murmurs or vascular bruits have been reported. Patients must be warned to report immediately the following symptoms and to discontinue the drug: cold, numb, and painful hands and feet; leg cramps on walking; any type of girdle, flank, or chest pain, shortness of breath, or any associated symptomatology. Should any of these symptoms develop, methysergide should be discontinued. Continuous administration should not exceed 6 months. There must be a drug-free interval of 3-4 weeks after each 6-month course of treatment. The dosage should be reduced gradually during the last 2-3 weeks of each treatment course to avoid "headache rebound."



 



 The drug is not recommended for use in children.
