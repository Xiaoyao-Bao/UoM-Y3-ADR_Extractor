  6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     Summary of Clinical Trials in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia  



 The safety data reflect exposure to Zydelig from two randomized, double-blind clinical trials (Studies 312-0116 and 312-0115) in 634 patients with relapsed CLL  [see  Clinical Studies (14.1)  ]  and one randomized, open-label trial in 259 patients with relapsed CLL (Study 312-0119).



     Zydelig with Rituximab (Study 312-0116; NCT01539512)  



 Patients with relapsed CLL received up to 8 doses of rituximab (R) with or without Zydelig 150 mg twice daily. The median duration of exposure to Zydelig was 8 months.



 Serious adverse reactions were reported in 65 (59%) patients treated with Zydelig + R The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported for patients treated with Zydelig + R were pneumonia (23%), diarrhea (10%), pyrexia (9%), sepsis (8%), and febrile neutropenia (5%). Adverse reactions that led to discontinuation of Zydelig occurred in 19 (17%) patients. The most common adverse reactions that led to treatment discontinuations were hepatotoxicity and diarrhea/colitis.



 Forty-two (38%) patients had dose interruptions and sixteen (15%) patients had dose reductions due to adverse reactions or laboratory abnormalities. The most common reasons for dose interruptions or reductions were pneumonia, diarrhea or colitis, rash, and elevated transaminases.



 Table 2 and Table 3 summarize common adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities reported for Zydelig + R and placebo + R arms.

 Adverse reactions that led to discontinuation of Zydelig occurred in 68 (33%) patients. The most common adverse reactions that led to treatment discontinuations were pneumonia, diarrhea, and pyrexia.



 One hundred twenty-two (59%) patients treated with Zydelig + BR had dose interruptions and 34 (16%) patients had dose reductions due to adverse reactions. The most common reasons for dose interruptions or reductions were increased ALT and diarrhea. The most common adverse reactions were neutropenia (64%), pyrexia (43%), and diarrhea (41%).



     Summary of Clinical Trials in Indolent Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma  



 The safety data reflect exposure to Zydelig from three open-label clinical trials (Studies 101-09 (NCT01282424), 101-02 (NCT00710528), and 101-10 (NCT01306643) in 146 patients with indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL) treated with Zydelig 150 mg twice daily  [see  Clinical Studies (14.2  ,  14.3)  ]  . The median duration of exposure was 6.1 months (range 0.3 to 26.4 months).



 Serious adverse reactions were reported in 73 (50%) patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions that occurred were pneumonia (15%), diarrhea (11%), and pyrexia (9%).



 Adverse reactions resulted in interruption or discontinuation for 78 (53%) patients. The most common reasons for interruption or discontinuations were diarrhea (11%), pneumonia (11%), and elevated transaminases (10%).



 Table 4 provides the adverse reactions occurring in at least 10% of patients receiving Zydelig monotherapy, and Table 5 provides the hematologic and hepatic laboratory abnormalities.

                Summary of Discontinued Clinical Trials in First-Line CLL and Early Line iNHL    
 

 Safety data described below reflect exposure to Zydelig in three randomized, double-blind clinical trials (Studies 312-0123, 313-0124, and 313-0125) in patients with CLL and iNHL.



 In Study 312-0123 (NCT01980888), 311 patients with previously untreated CLL received up to 6 cycles of BR with or without Zydelig 150 mg twice daily.



 In Study 313-0124 (NCT01732913), 295 patients with previously treated iNHL received 8 doses of R with or without Zydelig 150 mg twice daily. Patients had a median of one prior therapy.



 In Study 313-0125 (NCT01732926), 475 patients with previously treated iNHL received up to 6 cycles of BR with or without Zydelig 150 mg twice daily. Patients had a median of two prior therapies.



 These three studies were terminated early due to a higher incidence of fatal and/or serious adverse reactions observed in patients treated with Zydelig in combination with R or BR. The most frequent serious adverse reactions were in the system organ classes of infections and infestations, blood and lymphatic system disorders, and gastrointestinal disorders.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Zydelig. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

   5.1 Hepatotoxicity



   Fatal and/or serious hepatotoxicity occurred in 18% of patients treated with Zydelig monotherapy and 16% of patients treated with Zydelig in combination with rituximab or with unapproved combination therapies. Elevations in ALT or AST greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal have occurred [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  These findings were generally observed within the first 12 weeks of treatment and were reversible with dose interruption. After resumption of treatment at a lower dose, 26% of patients had recurrence of ALT and AST elevations. Discontinue Zydelig for recurrent hepatotoxicity.  



 Avoid concurrent use of Zydelig with other drugs that may cause liver toxicity.



 Monitor ALT and AST in all patients every 2 weeks for the first 3 months of treatment, every 4 weeks for the next 3 months, then every 1 to 3 months thereafter. Monitor weekly for liver toxicity if the ALT or AST rises above 3 times the upper limit of normal until resolved. Withhold Zydelig if the ALT or AST is greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal, and continue to monitor AST, ALT and total bilirubin weekly until the abnormality is resolved [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ].  



    5.2 Severe Diarrhea or Colitis



   Severe diarrhea or colitis (Grade 3 or higher) occurred in 14% of patients treated with Zydelig monotherapy and 20% of patients treated with Zydelig in combination with rituximab or with unapproved combination therapies [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  Diarrhea can occur at any time. Avoid concurrent use of Zydelig and other drugs that cause diarrhea. Diarrhea due to Zydelig responds poorly to antimotility agents. Median time to resolution ranged between 1 week and 1 month across trials, following interruption of Zydelig therapy and in some instances, use of corticosteroids [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ].    



    5.3 Pneumonitis



   Fatal and serious pneumonitis occurred in patients treated with Zydelig. Clinical manifestations included interstitial infiltrates and organizing pneumonia. In randomized clinical trials of combination therapies, pneumonitis occurred in 4% of patients treated with Zydelig compared to 1% on the comparator arms. Time to onset of pneumonitis ranged from &lt;1 to 15 months. Monitor patients on Zydelig for pulmonary symptoms. In patients taking Zydelig who present with pulmonary symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, hypoxia, interstitial infiltrates on a radiologic exam, or a decline by more than 5% in oxygen saturation, interrupt Zydelig until the etiology has been determined. If symptomatic pneumonitis or organizing pneumonia is diagnosed, initiate appropriate treatment with corticosteroids and permanently discontinue Zydelig [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  .  



    5.4 Infections



   Fatal and/or serious infections occurred in 21% of patients treated with Zydelig monotherapy and 48% of patients treated with Zydelig in combination with rituximab or with unapproved combination therapies [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . The most common infections were pneumonia, sepsis, and febrile neutropenia. Treat infections prior to initiation of Zydelig therapy. Monitor patients on Zydelig for signs and symptoms of infection, and interrupt Zydelig for Grade 3 or higher infection [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  .  



  Serious or fatal Pneumocystis jirovecii  pneumonia (PJP) or cytomegalovirus (CMV) occurred in &lt;1% of patients treated with Zydelig. Provide PJP prophylaxis during treatment with Zydelig. Interrupt Zydelig in patients with suspected PJP infection of any grade, and permanently discontinue Zydelig if PJP infection of any grade is confirmed. Regular clinical and laboratory monitoring for CMV infection is recommended in patients with history of CMV infection or positive CMV serology at the start of treatment with Zydelig. Interrupt Zydelig in the setting of positive CMV PCR or antigen test until the viremia has resolved. If Zydelig is subsequently resumed, patients should be monitored by PCR or antigen test for CMV reactivation at least monthly [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  .  



    5.5 Intestinal Perforation



  Fatal and serious intestinal perforation occurred in Zydelig-treated patients. At the time of perforation, some patients had moderate to severe diarrhea. Advise patients to promptly report any new or worsening abdominal pain, chills, fever, nausea, or vomiting. Discontinue Zydelig permanently in patients who experience intestinal perforation.



    5.6 Severe Cutaneous Reactions



  Fatal cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have occurred in patients treated with Zydelig. If SJS or TEN is suspected, interrupt Zydelig until the etiology of the reaction has been determined. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue Zydelig.



 Other severe or life-threatening (Grade &gt;=3) cutaneous reactions, including dermatitis exfoliative, rash, rash erythematous, rash generalized, rash macular, rash maculo-papular, rash papular, rash pruritic, exfoliative rash, and skin disorder, have been reported in Zydelig-treated patients. Monitor patients for the development of severe cutaneous reactions and discontinue Zydelig.



    5.7 Anaphylaxis



  Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients on Zydelig. In patients who develop serious allergic reactions, discontinue Zydelig permanently and institute appropriate supportive measures.



    5.8 Neutropenia



   Treatment-emergent Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurred in 25% of patients treated with Zydelig monotherapy and 58% of patients treated with Zydelig in combination with rituximab or with unapproved combination therapies .  Monitor blood counts at least every 2 weeks for the first 6 months of therapy, and at least weekly in patients while neutrophil counts are less than 1.0 Gi/L [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ].    



    5.9 Embryo-fetal Toxicity



   Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action, Zydelig may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of idelalisib to pregnant rats during organogenesis caused decreased fetal weight and congenital malformations at systemic exposures 12 times those reported in patients at the recommended dose of 150 mg twice daily. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 1 month after the last dose. [ see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1  ,  8.3)  ,  Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)  , and  Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)    ].
