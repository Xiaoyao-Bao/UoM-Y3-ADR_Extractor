    <Section id="S1" name="adverse reactions">      ADVERSE REACTIONS  

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of NORCO  (r)  . Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 The most frequently reported adverse reactions are light-headedness, dizziness, sedation, nausea and vomiting.  Other adverse reactions include:



   Central Nervous System       - Drowsiness, mental clouding, lethargy, impairment of mental and physical performance, anxiety, fear, dysphoria, psychological dependence, mood changes.



   Gastrointestinal System       - Constipation.



   Genitourinary System       - Ureteral spasm, spasm of vesical sphincters, and urinary retention.



   Special Senses  - Cases of Hearing impairment or permanent loss have been reported predominately in patients with chronic overdose.



   Dermatological  - Skin rash, pruritus, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, allergic reactions



   Hematological  - Thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis.

    WARNING: ADDICTION, ABUSE, AND MISUSE;     RISK EVALUATION AND MITIGATION STEATEGY (REMS);     LIFE-THREATENING RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION; ACCIDENTAL INGESTION; NEONATAL OPIOID WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME;     CYTOCHROME P450 3A4 INTERACTION    ;         HEPATOTOXICITY    ;     and     RISKS     FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH BENZODIAZEPINES OR OTHER CNS     DEPRESSANTS  

    Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse  



   NORCO      (r)       exposes patients and other users to the risks of opioid addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess each patient's risk prior to prescribing     NORCO      (r)      , and monitor all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors     and     conditions [see       WARNINGS      ].  



   Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)  



   To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a REMS for these products [see       WARNINGS      ]. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to  



 *  complete a REMS-compliant education program, 
 *  counsel patients and/or their caregivers, with every prescription, on safe use, serious risks, storage, and disposal of these products, 
 *  emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide every time it is provided by their pharmacist, and 
 *  consider other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety. 
      Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression  
 

   Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of     NORCO      (r)      . Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of     NORCO      (r)       or following a dose increase [see       WARNINGS      ].  



   Accidental Ingestion  



   Accidental ingestion of     NORCO      (r)      , especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of     NORCO      (r)           [see       WARNINGS      ].  



   Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome  



   Prolonged use of     NORCO      (r)           during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see       WARNINGS      ].  



   Cytochrome P450 3A4 Interaction  



   The concomitant use of     NORCO      (r)           with all     C    ytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may result in an increase in     NORCO      (r)           plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse reactions and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. In addition, discontinuation of a concomitantly used     C    ytochrome P450 3A4 inducer may result in an increase in     NORCO      (r)           plasma concentration    s    . Monitor patients receiving     NORCO      (r)           and any     Cytochrome P450 3A4     inhibitor or inducer     for signs of respiratory depression or sedation     [see       CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY      ,       WARNINGS      ,     and       PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions      ].  



   Hepatotoxicity  



   Acetaminophen has been associated with cases of acute liver failure, at times resulting in liver transplant and death. Most of the cases of liver injury are associated with the use of acetaminophen at doses that exceed 4    ,    000 milligrams per day, and often involve more than one acetaminophen    -    containing product     [see       WARNINGS      ,       OVERDOSAGE      ].  



   Risks From Concomitant Use With Benzodiazepines Or Other CNS Depressants  



   Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death [see       WARNINGS       and           PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions      ]    .  



 *  Reserve concomitant prescribing of NORCO(r) and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. 
 *  Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. 
 *  Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.

    <Section id="S3" name="precautions">     PRECAUTIONS  



   Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery  



 NORCO  (r)  Tablets may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of NORCO  (r)  Tablets and know how they will react to the medication [see   PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients    ].



     Information for Patients  



  Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (  Medication Guide  ).



   Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse    Inform patients that the use of NORCO  (r)  , even when taken as recommended, can result in addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death [see   WARNINGS    ]. Instruct patients not to share NORCO  (r)   with others and to take steps to protect NORCO  (r)  from theft or misuse.
 

   Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression    Inform patients of the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression, including information that the risk is greatest when starting NORCO  (r)  or when the dosage is increased, and that it can occur even at recommended dosages [see   WARNINGS    ]. Advise patients how to recognize respiratory depression and to seek medical attention if breathing difficulties develop.
 

   Accidental Ingestion    Inform patients that accidental ingestion, especially by children, may result in respiratory depression or death [see   WARNINGS    ]. Instruct patients to take steps to store NORCO  (r)  securely and to dispose of unused NORCO  (r)  by flushing down the toilet.

   Serotonin Syndrome    Inform patients that NORCO  (r)   could cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition resulting from concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs. Warn patients of the symptoms of serotonin syndrome and to seek medical attention right away if symptoms develop. Instruct patients to inform their healthcare providers if they are taking, or plan to take serotonergic medications [see   PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions    ].
 

   Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) Interaction    Inform patients to avoid taking NORCO  (r)  Tablets while using any drugs that inhibit monoamine oxidase. Patients should not start MAOIs while taking NORCO  (r)  Tablets [see   PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions    ] .  
 

   Adrenal Insufficiency    Inform patients that NORCO  (r)   could cause adrenal insufficiency, a potentially life-threatening condition. Adrenal insufficiency may present with non-specific symptoms and signs such as nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. Advise patients to seek medical attention if they experience a constellation of these symptoms [see   WARNINGS    ].
 

   Important Administration Instructions    Instruct patients how to properly take NORCO  (r)  Tablets [see   DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION     ,     WARNINGS     ]  .
 

   Maximum Daily Dose of Acetaminophen    Inform patients not to take more than 4,000 milligrams of acetaminophen per day. Advise patients to call their prescriber if they take more than the recommended dose.
 

   Hypotension    Inform patients that NORCO  (r)  Tablets may cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope. Instruct patients how to recognize symptoms of low blood pressure and how to reduce the risk of serious consequences should hypotension occur (e.g., sit or lie down, carefully rise from a sitting or lying position) [see   WARNINGS    ].
 

   Anaphylaxis    Inform patients that anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in NORCO  (r)  Tablets. Advise patients how to recognize such a reaction and when to seek medical attention [see   CONTRAINDICATIONS     ,     ADVERSE REACTIONS    ].
 

   Pregnancy     Neonatal   Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome  Inform female patients of reproductive potential that prolonged use of NORCO  (r)   during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated [see   WARNINGS    ,   PRECAUTIONS; Pregnancy    ].
 

   Embryo-Fetal Toxicity    Inform female patients of reproductive potential that NORCO  (r)   can cause fetal harm and to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy [see   PRECAUTIONS; Pregnancy    ].
 

   Lactation    Advise nursing mothers to monitor infants for increased sleepiness (more than usual), breathing difficulties, or limpness. Instruct nursing mothers to seek immediate medical care if they notice these signs [see   PRECAUTIONS; Nursing Mothers    ].
 

   Infertility    Inform patients that chronic use of opioids may cause reduced fertility. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see   ADVERSE REACTIONS    ] .  
 

   Driving or Operating Heavy Machinery    Inform patients that NORCO  (r)  Tablets may impair the ability to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating heavy machinery. Advise patients not to perform such tasks until they know how they will react to the medication [see   WARNINGS    ].
 

   Constipation    Advise patients of the potential for severe constipation, including management instructions and when to
 

 seek medical attention [  see   ADVERSE REACTIONS     ,     CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY     ]  .



   Disposal of Unused   NORCO     (r)      Advise patients to dispose of unused NORCO  (r)  Tablets by flushing unused tablets down the toilet.
 

     Laboratory Tests  



  In patients with severe hepatic or renal disease, effects of therapy should be followed with serial liver and/or renal function tests.



     Drug Interactions  



    Inhibitors of CYP3A4   and CYP2D6        The concomitant use of NORCO  (r)  and CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g. ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), can increase the plasma concentration of the hydrocodone from NORCO  (r)       Tablets, resulting in increased or prolonged opioid effects. These effects could be more pronounced with concomitant use of NORCO  (r)  and both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors, particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of NORCO  (r)  is achieved [see   WARNINGS    ].
 

 After stopping a CYP3A4 inhibitor, as the effects of the inhibitor decline, the NORCO  (r)  plasma concentration will decrease [see   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY    ], resulting in decreased opioid efficacy or a withdrawal syndrome in patients who had developed physical dependence to NORCO  (r)  .



 If concomitant use is necessary, consider dosage reduction of NORCO  (r)  until stable drug effects are achieved. Follow patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals. If a CYP3A4 inhibitor is discontinued, consider increasing the NORCO  (r)  dosage until stable drug effects are achieved. Follow for signs or symptoms of opioid withdrawal.



   Inducers of CYP3A4    The concomitant use of NORCO  (r)  and CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, can decrease the plasma concentration of NORCO  (r)   [see   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY    ], resulting in decreased efficacy or onset of a withdrawal syndrome in patients who have developed physical dependence to NORCO  (r)   [see   WARNINGS    ].
 

 After stopping a CYP3A4 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the NORCO  (r)   plasma concentration will increase [see   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY    ], which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic effects and adverse reactions, and may cause serious respiratory depression.



 If concomitant use is necessary, consider increasing the NORCO  (r)  dosage until stable drug effects are achieved. Follow the patient for signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal. If a CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued, consider NORCO  (r)  dosage reduction and follow for signs of respiratory depression.



   Benzodiazepines and   O   ther CNS Depressants    Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines and other CNS depressants, such as benzodiazepines and other sedative hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, and other opioids, including alcohol, can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death.
 

 Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients closely for signs of respiratory depression and sedation [see   WARNINGS    ].



   Serotonergic Drugs    The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue), has resulted in serotonin syndrome [see   PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients    ].
 

 If concomitant use is warranted, carefully follow the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue NORCO  (r)  if serotonin syndrome is suspected.



   Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)    The concomitant use of opioids and MAOIs, such as phenelzine, tranylcypromine, or linezolid, may manifest as serotonin syndrome, or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma) [see   WARNINGS    ].
 

 The use of NORCO  (r)  is not recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment.



 If urgent use of an opioid is necessary, use test doses and frequent titration of small doses to treat pain while closely monitoring blood pressure and signs and symptoms of CNS and respiratory depression.



   Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics    The concomitant use of opioids with other opioid analgesics, such as butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, may reduce the analgesic effect of NORCO  (r)  and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.
 

 Advise patient to avoid concomitant use of these drugs.



   Muscle Relaxants    NORCO  (r)  may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression.
 

 If concomitant use is warranted, monitor patients for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected and decrease the dosage of NORCO  (r)  and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary.



   Diuretics    Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone.
 

 If concomitant use is warranted, follow patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed.



   Anticholinergic Drugs    The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus.
 

 If concomitant use is warranted, follow patients for signs and symptoms of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when NORCO  (r)  Tablets are used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs.



     Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions  



  Acetaminophen may produce false-positive test results for urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid.



     Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  



    Carcinogenesis    Long-term studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of the combination of NORCO  (r)  Tablets have not been conducted.
 

 Long-term studies in mice and rats have been completed by the National Toxicology Program to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of acetaminophen. In 2-year feeding studies, F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were fed a diet containing acetaminophen up to 6000 ppm. Female rats demonstrated equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity based on increased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia at 0.8 times the maximum human daily dose (MHDD) of 4 grams/day, based on a body surface area comparison. In contrast, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity in male rats that received up to 0.7 times or mice at up to 1.2-1.4 times the MHDD, based on a body surface area comparison.



   Mutagen   e   sis    In the published literature, acetaminophen has been reported to be clastogenic when administered at 1500 mg/kg/day to the rat model (3.6-times the MHDD, based on a body surface area comparison). In contrast, no clastogenicity was noted at a dose of 750 mg/kg/day (1.8-times the MHDD, based on a body surface area comparison), suggesting a threshold effect.
 

   Impairment of Fertility    In studies conducted by the National Toxicology Program, fertility assessments with acetaminophen have been completed in Swiss CD-1 mice via a continuous breeding study. There were no effects on fertility parameters in mice consuming up to 1.7 times the MHDD of acetaminophen, based on a body surface area comparison. Although there was no effect on sperm motility or sperm density in the epididymis, there was a significant increase in the percentage of abnormal sperm in mice consuming 1.78 times the MHDD (based on a body surface comparison) and there was a reduction in the number of mating pairs producing a fifth litter at this dose, suggesting the potential for cumulative toxicity with chronic administration of acetaminophen near the upper limit of daily dosing.
 

 Published studies in rodents report that oral acetaminophen treatment of male animals at doses that are 1.2 times the MHDD and greater (based on a body surface comparison) result in decreased testicular weights, reduced spermatogenesis, reduced fertility, and reduced implantation sites in females given the same doses. These effects appear to increase with the duration of treatment. The clinical significance of these findings is not known.



   Infertility    Chronic use of opioids may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see   ADVERSE REACTIONS    ].
 

     Pregnancy  



    Teratogenic Effects    There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. NORCO  (r)  Tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.
 

     Nonteratogenic Effects  



    Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions    Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth.
 

 Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity, abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly [see   WARNINGS    ].



     Labor or Delivery  



  Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. NORCO  (r)  is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including NORCO  (r)  , can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression. 



     Nursing Mothers  



  Hydrocodone is present in human milk.



 The developmental and health benefits of breast-feeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for NORCO  (r)  and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from NORCO  (r)  or from the underlying maternal condition.



 Infants exposed to NORCO  (r)  through breast milk should be monitored for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breast-feeding is stopped. 



     Pediatric Use  



  Safety and effectiveness of NORCO  (r)   in pediatric patients have not been established.



     Geriatric Use  



  Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to NORCO  (r)  . In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.



 Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of NORCO  (r)   slowly in geriatric patients and follow closely for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [see   WARNINGS    ].



 Hydrocodone and acetaminophen are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.



  Hepatic Impairment  Patients with hepatic impairment may have higher plasma hydrocodone concentrations than those with normal function. Use a low initial dose of NORCO  (r)  in patients with hepatic impairment and follow closely for adverse events such as respiratory depression and sedation.
 

  Renal Impairment  Patients with renal impairment may have higher plasma hydrocodone concentrations than those with normal function. Use a low initial dose of NORCO  (r)  in patients with renal impairment and follow closely for adverse events such as respiratory depression and sedation.

    <Section id="S4" name="warnings">     WARNINGS  



    Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse  



  NORCO  (r)  contains hydrocodone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, NORCO  (r)  exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see   DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE    ].



 Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed NORCO  (r)  . Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused.



 Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing NORCO  (r)  , and monitor all patients receiving NORCO  (r)  for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as NORCO  (r)  , but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of NORCO  (r)  along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse.



 Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing NORCO  (r)  . Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see   PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients    ]. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.



  Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)  



 To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to do all of the following:



 *  Complete a REMS-compliant education program offered by an accredited provider of continuing education (CE) or another education program that includes all the elements of the FDA Education Blueprint for Health Care Providers Involved in the Management or Support of Patients with Pain. 
 *  Discuss the safe use, serious risks, and proper storage and disposal of opioid analgesics with patients and/or their caregivers every time these medicines are prescribed. The Patient Counseling Guide (PCG) can be obtained at this link: www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSPC  G . 
 *  Emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide that they will receive from their pharmacist every time an opioid analgesic is dispensed to them. 
 *  Consider using other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety, such as patient-prescriber agreements that reinforce patient-prescriber responsibilities. 
    To obtain further information on the opioid analgesic REMS and for a list of accredited REMS CME/CE, call 1-800-503-0784, or log on to www.opioidanalgesicrems.com  . The FDA Blueprint can be found at www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSBlueprint  .
 

     Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression  



  Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see   OVERDOSAGE    ]. Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.



 While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of NORCO  (r)  , the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24-72 hours of initiating therapy with and following dosage increases of NORCO  (r)  .



 To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of NORCO  (r)   is essential [see   DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION    ]. Overestimating the NORCO  (r)  dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose.



 Accidental ingestion of NORCO  (r)  , especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of NORCO  (r)  .



     Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome  



  Prolonged use of NORCO  (r)  Tablets during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see   PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients     ,     Pregnancy    ].



     Risks of Concomitant Use or Discontinuation of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers  



  Concomitant use of NORCO  (r)  Tablets with a CYP3A4 inhibitor, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may increase plasma concentrations of NORCO  (r)  Tablets and prolong opioid adverse reactions, which may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression [see   WARNINGS    ], particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of NORCO  (r)  Tablets is achieved .  Similarly, discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inducer, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, in NORCO  (r)  Tablets-treated patients may increase hydrocodone plasma concentrations and prolong opioid adverse reactions. When adding CYP3A4 inhibitors or discontinuing CYP3A4 inducers in NORCO  (r)  Tablets-treated patients, follow patients at frequent intervals and consider dosage reduction of NORCO  (r)  Tablets until stable drug effects are achieved [see   PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions    ].



 Concomitant use of NORCO  (r)  Tablets with CYP3A4 inducers or discontinuation of an CYP3A4 inhibitor could decrease hydrocodone plasma concentrations, decrease opioid efficacy or, possibly, lead to a withdrawal syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to hydrocodone. When using NORCO  (r)  Tablets with CYP3A4 inducers or discontinuing CYP3A4 inhibitors, follow patients at frequent intervals and consider increasing the opioid dosage if needed to maintain adequate analgesia or if symptoms of opioid withdrawal occur [see   PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions    ].



     Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants  



  Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of NORCO  (r)  Tablets with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.



 Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see   PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions    ].



 If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.



 Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when NORCO  (r)  Tablets are used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [see   PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions     ,     Information for Patients    ].



     Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients  



  The use of NORCO  (r)  Tablets in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated.



  Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease   :   NORCO  (r)  Tablet-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of NORCO  (r)  Tablets [see   WARNINGS; Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression    ] .  



  Elderly, Cache   c   tic, or Debilitated Patients  :    Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see   WARNINGS; Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression     ]   .  



 Follow such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating NORCO  (r)  Tablets and when NORCO  (r)  Tablets are given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see   WARNINGS; Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression     ]   .  Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients.



     Adrenal Insufficiency  



  Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.



     Severe Hypotension  



  NORCO  (r)  Tablets may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see   PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions    ]. Follow these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of NORCO  (r)  Tablets. In patients with circulatory shock NORCO  (r)  Tablets may cause vasodilatation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of NORCO  (r)  Tablets with circulatory shock.



     Hepatotoxicity  



  Acetaminophen has been associated with cases of acute liver failure, at times resulting in liver transplant and death. Most of the cases of liver injury are associated with the use of acetaminophen at doses that exceed 4,000 milligrams per day, and often involve more than one acetaminophen-containing product. The excessive intake of acetaminophen may be intentional to cause self-harm or unintentional as patients attempt to obtain more pain relief or unknowingly take other acetaminophen-containing products.



 The risk of acute liver failure is higher in individuals with underlying liver disease and in individuals who ingest alcohol while taking acetaminophen.



 Instruct patients to look for acetaminophen or APAP on package labels and not to use more than one product that contains acetaminophen. Instruct patients to seek medical attention immediately upon ingestion of more than 4,000 milligrams of acetaminophen per day, even if they feel well.



     Serious Skin Reactions  



  Rarely, acetaminophen may cause serious skin reactions such as acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. Patients should be informed about the signs of serious skin reactions, and use of the drug should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity.



     Hypersensitivity/Anaphylaxis  



  There have been post-marketing reports of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis associated with the use of acetaminophen. Clinical signs included swelling of the face, mouth, and throat, respiratory distress, urticaria, rash, pruritus, and vomiting. There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergency medical attention. Instruct patients to discontinue NORCO  (r)   immediately and seek medical care if they experience these symptoms. Do not prescribe NORCO  (r)   Tablets for patients with acetaminophen allergy [see    PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients    ].



     Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness  



  In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), NORCO  (r)  Tablets may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Follow such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with NORCO  (r)  Tablets.



 Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of NORCO  (r)  Tablets in patients with impaired consciousness or coma.



     Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions  



  NORCO  (r)  Tablets are contraindicated in patients with gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus.



 The administration of NORCO  (r)  Tablets or other opioids may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal conditions.



 Hydrocodone may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms.



     Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders  



  The hydrocodone in NORCO  (r)  Tablets may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Follow patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during NORCO  (r)  tablet therapy.



     Withdrawal  



  Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including NORCO  (r)  Tablets. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.



 When discontinuing NORCO  (r)  Tablets, gradually taper the dosage [see   DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION    ]. Do not abruptly discontinue NORCO  (r)  [see   DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE    ] in patients who have been using NORCO  (r)  Tablets around the clock for more than 5 days.
