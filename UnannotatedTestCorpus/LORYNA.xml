  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     Contraception and Acne Clinical Trials    



 The data provided reflect the experience with the use of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol in the adequate and well-controlled studies for contraception (N=1,056) and for moderate acne vulgaris (N=536).



 For contraception, a Phase 3, multicenter, multinational, open-label study was conducted to evaluate safety and efficacy up to one year in 1,027 women aged 17 to 36 who took at least one dose of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol. A second Phase 3 study was a single center, open-label, active-controlled study to evaluate the effect of 7 28-day cycles of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol on carbohydrate metabolism, lipids and hemostasis in 29 women aged 18 to 35. For acne, two multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies, in 536 women aged 14 to 45 with moderate acne vulgaris who took at least one dose of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol, evaluated the safety and efficacy during up to 6 cycles.



 The adverse reactions seen across the 2 indications overlapped, and are reported using the frequencies from the pooled dataset. The most common adverse reactions (&gt;= 2% of users) were: headache/migraine (6.7%), menstrual irregularities (including vaginal hemorrhage [primarily spotting] and metrorrhagia (4.7%), nausea/vomiting (4.2%), breast pain/tenderness (4%) and mood changes (mood swings, depression, depressed mood and affect lability) (2.2%).



     Adverse Reactions (&gt;=1%) Leading to Study Discontinuation    



   Contraception Clinical Trials  



 Of 1,056 women, 6.6% discontinued from the clinical trials due to an adverse reaction; the most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were headache/migraine (1.6%) and nausea/vomiting (1%).



   Acne Clinical Trials  



 Of 536 women, 5.4% discontinued from the clinical trials due to an adverse reaction; the most frequent adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was menstrual irregularities (including menometrorrhagia, menorrhagia, metrorrhagia and vaginal hemorrhage) (2.2%) .



     Serious Adverse Reactions    



   Contraception Clinical Trials:  migraine and cervical dysplasia



   Acne Clinical Trials:  none reported in the clinical trials



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 Adverse reactions are grouped into System Organ Classes, and ordered by frequency.



     Vascular disorders:    Venous and arterial thromboembolic events (including pulmonary emboli, deep vein thrombosis, cerebral thrombosis, retinal thrombosis, myocardial infarction and stroke), hypertension (including hypertensive crisis)



     Hepatobiliary disorders:    Gallbladder disease, liver function disturbances, liver tumors



     Immune system disorders:    Hypersensitivity (including anaphylactic reaction)



     Metabolism and nutrition disorders:    Hyperkalemia, hypertriglyceridemia, changes in glucose tolerance or effect on peripheral insulin resistance (including diabetes mellitus)



     Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:    Chloasma, angioedema, erythema nodosum, erythema multiforme



     Gastrointestinal disorders:    Inflammatory bowel disease



     Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders:    Systemic lupus erythematosus

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: CIGARETTE SMOKING AND SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS

  WARNING: CIGARETTE SMOKING AND SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS

    Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from combination oral contraceptives (COC) use. This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked. For this reason, COCs should not be used by women who are over 35 years of age and smoke. [See CONTRADICTIONS (  4  )]  



   EXCERPT:   WARNING: CIGARETTE SMOKING AND SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS



   See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.  



 *  Women over 35 years old who smoke should not use drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets (4). 
 *  Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from combination oral contraceptive (COC) use. (4) 
    
 







    BOXED WARNING: FDA Approved Patient Labeling

  FDA Approved Patient Labeling

    Guide for Using Loryna  TM   (drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets) 3 mg/0.02 mg   



   

    WARNING TO WOMEN WHO SMOKE  



 Do not use drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets if you smoke cigarettes and are over 35 years old. Smoking increases your risk of serious cardiovascular side effects (heart and blood vessel problems) from birth control pills, including death from heart attack, blood clots or stroke. This risk increases with age and the number of cigarettes you smoke.



   Birth control pills help to lower the chances of becoming pregnant when taken as directed. They do not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases. 



   What is Loryna  TM  ?   



 Loryna  TM   is a birth control pill. It contains two female hormones, a synthetic estrogen called ethinyl estradiol and a progestin called drospirenone. 



 The progestin drospirenone may increase potassium. Therefore, you should not take Loryna  TM   if you have kidney, liver or adrenal disease because this could cause serious heart and health problems. Other drugs may also increase potassium. If you are currently on daily, long-term treatment for a chronic condition with any of the medications below, you should consult your healthcare provider about whether Loryna  TM   is right for you, and during the first month that you take Loryna  TM   , you should have a blood test to check your potassium level. 



 *  NSAIDs (ibuprofen [Motrin, Advil], naproxen [Aleve and others] when taken long-term and daily for treatment of arthritis or other problems) 
 *  Potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone and others) 
 *  Potassium supplementation 
 *  ACE inhibitors (Capoten, Vasotec, Zestril and others) 
 *   Angiotensin-II receptor antagonists (Cozaar, Diovan, Avapro and others) 
 *   Heparin 
 *  Aldosterone antagonists 
    Loryna  TM   may also be taken to treat moderate acne if all of the following are true: 
 

 *  Your healthcare provider says it is safe for you to use LorynaTM . 
 *  You are at least 14 years old. 
 *  You have started having menstrual periods. 
 *  You want to use a birth control pill to prevent pregnancy. 
      How Well Does Loryna  TM   Work?   
 

 Your chance of getting pregnant depends on how well you follow the directions for taking your birth control pills. The better you follow the directions, the less chance you have of getting pregnant. 



 Based on the results of one clinical study, 1 to 2 women out of 100 women, may get pregnant during the first year they use Loryna  TM   . 



 The following chart shows the chance of getting pregnant for women who use different methods of birth control. Each box on the chart contains a list of birth control methods that are similar in effectiveness. The most effective methods are at the top of the chart. The box on the bottom of the chart shows the chance of getting pregnant for women who do not use birth control and are trying to get pregnant. 



    How Do I Take Loryna  TM  ?   



 1.   Be sure to read these directions   before you start taking your pills or anytime you are not sure what to do.



 2. The right way to take the pill is to take one pill every day at the same time in the order directed on the package. Preferably, take the pill after the evening meal or at bedtime, with some liquid, as needed. Loryna  TM   can be taken without regard to meals.



 If you miss pills you could get pregnant. This includes starting the pack late. The more pills you miss, the more likely you are to get pregnant. See "  WHAT TO DO IF YOU MISS PILLS"   below. 



 3. Many women have spotting or light bleeding at unexpected times, or may feel sick to their stomach during the first 1 to 3 packs of pills.



 If you do have spotting or light bleeding or feel sick to your stomach, do not stop taking the pill. The problem will usually go away. If it does not go away, check with your healthcare provider. 



 4. Missing pills can also cause spotting or light bleeding, even when you make up these missed pills. 



 On the days you take two pills, to make up for missed pills, you could also feel a little sick to your stomach. 



 5. If you have vomiting (within 3 to 4 hours after you take your pill), you should follow the instructions for   "WHAT TO DO IF YOU MISS PILLS."   If you have diarrhea or if you take certain medicines, including some antibiotics and some herbal products such as St. John's Wort, your pills may not work as well. 



 Use a back-up method (such as condoms and spermicides) until you check with your healthcare provider. 



 6. If you have trouble remembering to take the pill, talk to your healthcare provider about how to make pill-taking easier or about using another method of birth control.



 7.   If you have any questions or are unsure about the information in this leaflet, call your healthcare provider.   



     Before You Start Taking Your Pills     



     1. Decide What Time of Day You Want to Take Your Pill     



 It is important to take Loryna  TM   in the order directed on the package at the same time every day, preferably after the evening meal or at bedtime, with some liquid, as needed. Loryna  TM   can be taken without regard to meals. 



     2. Look at Your Pill Pack - It has 28 Pills     



 The Loryna  TM   -pill pack has   24 peach pills   (with hormones) to be taken for 24 days, followed by   4 white pills   (without hormones) to be taken for the next four days. 



     3. Also look for:    



 a) Where on the pack to start taking pills,



 b) In what order to take the pills (follow the arrows) 



 4    .     Be sure you have ready at all times (a) another kind of birth control (such as condoms and spermicides) to use as a back-up in case you miss pills, and (b) an extra, full pill pack. 



     When To Start the First Pack of Pills     



 You have a choice for which day to start taking your first pack of pills. Decide with your healthcare provider which is the best day for you. Pick a time of day which will be easy to remember. 



   Day 1 Start:   



 *  1.Take the first peach pill of the pack during the first 24 hours of your period. 
 *  2.You will not need to use a back-up method of birth control, since you are starting the Pill at the beginning of your period. However, if you start LorynaTM later than the first day of your period, you should use another method of birth control (such as a condom and spermicide) as a back-up method until you have taken 7 peach pills. 
      Sunday Start:   
 

 *  1.Take the first peach pill of the pack on the Sunday after your period starts, even if you are still bleeding. If your period begins on Sunday, start the pack that same day. 
 *  2.Use another method of birth control (such as a condom and spermicide) as a back-up method if you have sex anytime from the Sunday you start your first pack until the next Sunday (7 days). This also applies if you start LorynaTM after having been pregnant, and you have not had a period since your pregnancy. 
        When You Switch From a Different Birth Control Pill     
 

 When switching from another birth control pill, Loryna  TM   should be started on the same day that a new pack of the previous birth control pill would have been started. 



     When You Switch From Another Type of Birth Control Method     



 When switching from a transdermal patch or vaginal ring, Loryna  TM   should be started when the next application would have been due. When switching from an injection, Loryna  TM   should be started when the next dose would have been due. When switching from an intrauterine contraceptive or an implant, Loryna  TM   should be started on the day of removal. 



     What to Do During the Month     



 1. Take one pill at the same time every day until the pack is empty. 



 Do not skip pills even if you are spotting or bleeding between monthly periods or feel sick to your stomach (nausea). 



 Do not skip pills even if you do not have sex very often. 



 2. When you finish a pack of pills, start the next pack on the day after your last white pill. Do not wait any days between packs. 



     What to Do if You Miss Pills     



   If you miss 1 peach pill of your pack:   



 *  1.Take it as soon as you remember. Take the next pill at your regular time. This means you may take two pills in one day. 
 *  2.You do not need to use a back-up birth control method if you have sex. 
      If you miss 2 peach pills in a row in Week 1 or Week 2 of your pack:   
 

 *  1.Take two pills on the day you remember and two pills the next day. 
 *  2.Then take one pill a day until you finish the pack. 
 *  3.You could become pregnant if you have sex in the 7 days after you restart your pills. You must use another birth control method (such as a condom and spermicide) as a back-up for those 7 days. 
      If you miss 2 peach pills in a row in Week 3 or Week 4 of your pack:   
 

   1. If you are a Day 1 Starter:  



 Throw out the rest of the pill pack and start a new pack that same day. 



   If you are a Sunday Starter:   



 Keep taking one pill every day until Sunday. On Sunday, throw out the rest of the pack and start a new pack of pills that same day. 



   2. You could become pregnant   if you have sex in the 7 days after you restart your pills. You must use another birth control method (such as a condom and spermicide) as a back-up for those 7 days.



 3. You may not have your period this month but this is expected.   However, if you miss your period two months in a row, call your healthcare provider because you might be pregnant.   



   If you miss 3 or more peach pills in a row during any week:   



   1. If you are a Day 1 Starter:  



 Throw out the rest of the pill pack and start a new pack that same day. 



   If you are a Sunday Starter:   



 Keep taking 1 pill every day until Sunday. On Sunday, throw out the rest of the pack and start a new pack of pills that same day. 



   2. You could become pregnant   if you have sex in the 7 days after you restart your pills. You must use another birth control method (such as condoms and spermicides) as a back-up for those 7 days.



   3. Call your healthcare provider if you miss your period, because you might be pregnant.   



   If you miss any of the 4 white pills in Week 4:   



 Throw away the pills you missed. 



 Keep taking one pill each day until the pack is empty.



 You do not need a back-up method. 



   Finally, if you are still not sure what to do about the pills you have missed:   



 Use a back-up method (such as condoms and spermicides) anytime you have sex. 



 Contact your healthcare provider and continue taking one active peach pill each day until otherwise directed. 



   WHO SHOULD NOT TAKE LORYNA  TM   ?  



 Your healthcare provider will not give you Loryna  TM   if you: 



 *  Ever had blood clots in your legs (deep vein thrombosis), lungs (pulmonary embolism), or eyes (retinal thrombosis) 
 *  Ever had a stroke 
 *  Ever had a heart attack 
 *  Have certain heart valve problems or heart rhythm abnormalities that can cause blood clots to form in the heart 
 *  Have an inherited problem with your blood that makes it clot more than normal 
 *  Have high blood pressure that medicine can't control 
 *  Have diabetes with kidney, eye, nerve, or blood vessel damage 
 *  Ever had certain kinds of severe migraine headaches with aura, numbness, weakness or changes in vision 
 *  Ever had breast cancer or any cancer that is sensitive to female hormones 
 *  Have liver disease, including liver tumors 
 *  Take any Hepatitis C drug combination containing ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir. This may increase levels of the liver enzyme "alanine aminotransferase" (ALT) in the blood. 
 *  Have kidney disease 
 *  Have adrenal disease 
    Also, do not take birth control pills if you: 
 

 *  Smoke and are over 35 years old 
 *  Are or suspect you are pregnant 
    Birth control pills may not be a good choice for you if you have ever had jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes) caused by pregnancy (also called cholestasis of pregnancy). 
 

 Tell your healthcare provider if you have ever had any of the above conditions (your healthcare provider can recommend another method of birth control). 



   What Else Should I Know about Taking Loryna  TM  ?   



 Birth control pills do not protect you against any sexually transmitted disease, including HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. 



 Do not skip any pills, even if you do not have sex often. 



 If you miss a period, you could be pregnant. However, some women miss periods or have light periods on birth control pills, even when they are not pregnant. Contact your healthcare provider for advice if you: 



 *  Think you are pregnant 
 *  Miss one period and have not taken your birth control pills every day 
 *  Miss two periods in a row 
    Birth control pills should not be taken during pregnancy. However, birth control pills taken by accident during pregnancy are not known to cause birth defects. 
 

 You should stop Loryna  TM   at least four weeks before you have major surgery and not restart it until at least two weeks after the surgery due to an increased risk of blood clots. 



 If you are breastfeeding, consider another birth control method until you are ready to stop breastfeeding. Birth control pills that contain estrogen, like Loryna  TM  , may decrease the amount of milk you make. A small amount of the pill's hormones pass into breast milk. 



 If you have vomiting or diarrhea, your birth control pills may not work as well. Use another birth control method, like condoms and a spermicide, until you check with your healthcare provider. 



 If you are scheduled for any laboratory tests, tell your doctor you are taking birth-control pills. Certain blood tests may be affected by birth-control pills. 



   Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take  , including prescription and over the-counter medicines, vitamins and herbal supplements.



 Loryna  TM   may affect the way other medicines work, and other medicines may affect how well Loryna  TM   works. Know the medicines you take.



 Keep a list of them to show your healthcare provider and pharmacist when you get a new medicine.



   What are the Most Serious Risks of Taking Birth Control Pills?   



 Like pregnancy, birth control pills increase the risk of serious blood clots (see following graph), especially in women who have other risk factors, such as smoking, obesity, or age greater than 35. This increased risk is highest when you first start taking birth control pills and when you restart the same or different birth control pills after not using them for a month or more. Women who use birth control pills with drospirenone (like LorynaTM) may have a higher risk of getting a blood clot. Some studies reported that the risk of blood clots was higher for women who use birth control pills that contain drospirenone than for women who use birth control pills that do not contain drospirenone. 



   Talk with your healthcare provider about your risk of getting a blood clot before deciding which birth control pill is right for you.   



 It is possible to die or be permanently disabled from a problem caused by a blood clot, such as a heart attack or a stroke. Some examples of serious clots are blood clots in the: 



 *  Legs ( deep vein thrombosis or DVT ) 
 *  Lungs (pulmonary embolus or PE) 
 *  Eyes (loss of eyesight) 
 *  Heart (heart attack) 
 *  Brain (stroke) 
    To put the risk of developing a blood clot into perspective: If 10,000 women who are not pregnant and do not use birth control pills are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these women will develop a blood clot. The figure below shows the likelihood of developing a serious blood clot for women who are not pregnant and do not use birth control pills, for women who use birth control pills, for pregnant women, and for women in the first 12 weeks after delivering a baby.
 

 A few women who take birth control pills may get: 



 *  High blood pressure 
 *  Gallbladder problems 
 *  Rare cancerous or noncancerous liver tumors 
    All of these events are uncommon in healthy women. 
 

   Call your healthcare provider right away if you have:   



 *  Persistent leg pain 
 *  Sudden shortness of breath 
 *  Sudden blindness, partial or complete 
 *  Severe pain in your chest 
 *  Sudden, severe headache unlike your usual headaches 
 *  Weakness or numbness in an arm or leg, or trouble speaking 
 *  Yellowing of the skin or eyeballs 
      What are the Common Side Effects of Birth Control Pills?   
 

 The most common side effects of birth control pills are: 



 *  Spotting or bleeding between menstrual periods 
 *  Nausea 
 *  Breast tenderness 
 *  Headache 
    These side effects are usually mild and usually disappear with time. 
 

 Less common side effects are: 



 *  Acne 
 *  Less sexual desire 
 *  Bloating or fluid retention 
 *  Blotchy darkening of the skin, especially on the face 
 *  High blood sugar, especially in women who already have diabetes 
 *  High fat (cholesterol; triglyceride) levels in the blood 
 *  Depression, especially if you have had depression in the past. Call your healthcare provider immediately if you have any thoughts of harming yourself. 
 *  Problems tolerating contact lenses 
 *  Weight changes 
    This is not a complete list of possible side effects. Talk to your healthcare provider if you develop any side effects that concern you. 
 

   You may report side effects to the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.   



 No serious problems have been reported from a birth control pill overdose, even when accidentally taken by children. 



   Do Birth Control Pills Cause Cancer?   



 Birth control pills do not seem to cause breast cancer. However, if you have breast cancer now, or have had it in the past, do not use birth control pills because some breast cancers are sensitive to hormones. 



 Women who use birth control pills may have a slightly higher chance of getting cervical cancer. However, this may be due to other reasons such as having more sexual partners. 



   What Should I Know about My Period when Taking Loryna  TM  ?   



 Irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting may occur while you are taking Loryna  TM  . Irregular bleeding may vary from slight staining between menstrual periods to breakthrough bleeding, which is a flow much like a regular period. Irregular bleeding occurs most often during the first few months of oral contraceptive use, but may also occur after you have been taking the pill for some time. Such bleeding may be temporary and usually does not indicate any serious problems. It is important to continue taking your pills on schedule. If the bleeding occurs in more than one cycle, is unusually heavy, or lasts for more than a few days, call your healthcare provider. 



 Some women may not have a menstrual period but this should not be cause for alarm as long has you have taken the pills according to direction. 



   What if I Miss My Scheduled Period when Taking Loryna  TM  ?   



 It is not uncommon to miss your period. However, if you miss two periods in a row or miss one period when you have not taken your birth control pills according to directions, call your healthcare provider. Also notify your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of pregnancy such as morning sickness or unusual breast tenderness. It is important that your healthcare provider checks you to find out if you are pregnant. Stop taking Loryna  TM   if you are pregnant. 



   What If I Want to Become Pregnant?   



 You may stop taking the pill whenever you wish. Consider a visit with your healthcare provider for a pre-pregnancy checkup before you stop taking the pill. 



   General Advice about Loryna  TM  .  



 Your healthcare provider prescribed Loryna  TM   for you. Please do not share Loryna  TM   with anyone else. Keep Loryna  TM   out of the reach of children. 



 If you have concerns or questions, ask your healthcare provider. You may also ask your healthcare provider for a more detailed label written for medical professionals.

   EXCERPT:    *    Vascular risks: Stop drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (  5.1  ) COCs containing DRSP may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than COCs containing levonorgestrel or some other progestins. Before initiating drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP, consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP-containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE. (  5.1  ) 
 *    Hyperkalemia: DRSP has anti-mineralocorticoid activity. Do not use in patients predisposed to hyperkalemia. Check serum potassium concentration during the first treatment cycle in women on long-term treatment with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration. (  5.2  ,  7.3  ) 
 *    Liver disease: Discontinue drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets if jaundice occurs. (  5.4  ) 
 *    High blood pressure: Do not prescribe drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease. (  5.5  ) 
 *    Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (  5.7  ) 
 *    Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol if indicated. (  5.8  ) 
 *    Uterine bleeding: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (  5.9  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems



  Stop Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets if an arterial or venous thrombotic (VTE) event occurs.



 Based on presently available information on DRSP-containing COCs with 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol (that is, Yasmin), DRSP-containing COCs may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than COCs containing the progestin levonorgestrel or some other progestins. Epidemiologic studies that compared the risk of VTE reported that the risk ranged from no increase to a three-fold increase. Before initiating use of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP, consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP-containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE. Known risk factors for VTE include smoking, obesity, and family history of VTE, in addition to other factors that contraindicate use of COCs [see Contraindications  (  4  )].



 A number of studies have compared the risk of VTE for users of Yasmin (which contains 0.03 mg of EE and 3 mg of DRSP) to the risk for users of other COCs, including COCs containing levonorgestrel. Those that were required or sponsored by regulatory agencies are summarized in Table 1.

         In addition to these "regulatory studies," other studies of various designs have been conducted. Overall, there are two prospective cohort studies (see Table 1): the US post-approval safety study Ingenix [Seeger 2007], the European post-approval safety study EURAS (European Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger 2007]. An extension of the EURAS study, the Long-Term Active Surveillance Study (LASS), did not enroll additional subjects, but continued to assess VTE risk. There are three retrospective cohort studies: one study in the US funded by the FDA (see Table 1), and two from Denmark [Lidegaard 2009, Lidegaard 2011]. There are two case-control studies: the Dutch MEGA study analysis [van Hylckama Vlieg 2009] and the German case-control study [Dinger 2010]. There are two nested case-control studies that evaluated the risk of non-fatal idiopathic VTE: the PharMetrics study [Jick 2011] and the GPRD study [Parkin 2011]. The results of all of these studies are presented in Figure 1.

 Although the absolute VTE rates are increased for users of hormonal contraceptives compared to non-users, the rates during pregnancy are even greater, especially during the post-partum period (see Figure 2). The risk of VTE in women using COCs has been estimated to be 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use. Data from a large, prospective cohort safety study of various COCs suggest that this increased risk, as compared to that in non-COC users, is greatest during the first 6 months of COC use. Data from this safety study indicate that the greatest risk of VTE is present after initially starting a COC or restarting (following a 4 week or greater pill-free interval) the same or a different COC.



 The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued.



 Figure 2 shows the risk of developing a VTE for women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives, for women who use oral contraceptives, for pregnant women, and for women in the postpartum period. To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective: If 10,000 women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these women will develop a VTE.



 If feasible, stop drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism.



 Start drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week.



 Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events.



 COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (&gt;35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors.



 Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors.



 Stop drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. [See ADVERSE REACTIONS (  6  ).  ]



  Figure 1  Figure 2    5.2 Hyperkalemia



  Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets contain 3 mg of the progestin DRSP which has anti-mineralocorticoid activity, including the potential for hyperkalemia in high-risk patients, comparable to a 25 mg dose of spironolactone. Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol is contraindicated in patients with conditions that predispose to hyperkalemia (that is, renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and adrenal insufficiency). Women receiving daily, long-term treatment for chronic conditions or diseases with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration should have their serum potassium concentration checked during the first treatment cycle. Medications that may increase serum potassium concentration include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor antagonists, potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplementation, heparin, aldosterone antagonists, and NSAIDS.



 Consider monitoring serum potassium concentration in high-risk patients who take a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor long-term and concomitantly. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include azole antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole), HIV/HCV protease inhibitors (e.g., indinavir, boceprevir), and clarithromycin [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)  ].



    5.3 Carcinoma of the Breasts and Reproductive Organs



  Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets because breast cancer is a hormonally-sensitive tumor.



 There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings.



 Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors.



    5.4 Liver Disease



  Discontinue drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol if jaundice develops. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded.



 Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage.



 Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (&gt;8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users.



 Oral contraceptive-related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. Women with a history of COC-related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use.



    5.5 Risk of Liver Enzyme Elevations with Concomitant Hepatitis C Treatment



  During clinical trials with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen that contains ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, ALT elevations greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), including some cases greater than 20 times the ULN, were significantly more frequent in women using ethinyl estradiol-containing medications, such as COCs. Discontinue drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol prior to starting therapy with the combination drug regimen ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir [see CONTRAINDICATIONS  (  4  )]. Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen.



    5.6 High Blood Pressure



  For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs.



 An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin.



    5.7 Gallbladder Disease



  Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users.



    5.8 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects



  Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol. COCs may decrease glucose intolerance in a dose-related fashion.



 Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COC's.



 Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs.



    5.9 Headache



  If a woman taking drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol if indicated.



 An increase in frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) may be a reason for immediate discontinuation of the COC.



    5.10 Bleeding Irregularities



  Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC.



 Based on patient diaries from two contraceptive clinical trials of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets, 8 to 25% of women experienced unscheduled bleeding per 28-day cycle. A total of 12 subjects out of 1,056 (1.1%) discontinued due to menstrual disorders including intermenstrual bleeding, menorrhagia, and metrorrhagia.



 Women who use drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets may experience absence of withdrawal bleeding, even if they are not pregnant. Based on subject diaries from contraception trials for up to 13 cycles, 6 to 10% of women experienced cycles with no withdrawal bleeding. Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.



 If withdrawal bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.



    5.11 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy



  Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned, when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy.



 The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (  8.1  )  ].



    5.12 Depression



  Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree.



    5.13 Interference with Laboratory Tests



  The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increase with use of COCs. [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (  7.2  )  ].



 DRSP causes an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone induced by its mild anti-mineralocorticoid activity.



    5.14 Monitoring



  A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare.



    5.15 Other Conditions



  In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking COCs.
