  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials of patients treated with ondansetron, the active ingredient of ZOFRAN. A causal relationship to therapy with ZOFRAN was unclear in many cases.



   Prevention of Chemotherapy  -  induced Nausea and Vomiting  



 The most common adverse reactions reported in greater than or equal to 4% of 300 adults receiving a single 24-mg dose of ZOFRAN orally in 2 trials for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic chemotherapy (cisplatin greater than or equal to 50 mg/m  2  ) were: headache (11%) and diarrhea (4%).



 The most common adverse reactions reported in 4 trials in adults for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (primarily cyclophosphamide-based regimens) are shown in Table 3.



 Table 3: Most Common Adverse Reactions in Adultsa for the Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting Associated with Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy [Primarily Cyclophosphamide-based Regimens] 
  Adverse Reaction                   ZOFRAN 8 mg Twice Daily  (n = 242)                 Placebo  (n = 262)    
  Headache                           58 (24%)                                           34 (13%)            
  Malaise/fatigue                    32 (13%)                                           6 (2%)              
  Constipation                       22 (9%)                                            1 (&lt;1%)             
  Diarrhea                           15 (6%)                                            10 (4%)             
           a  Reported in greater than or equal to 5% of patients treated with ZOFRAN and at a rate that exceeded placebo.
 

   Less Common Adverse Reactions  



   Central Nervous System:  Extrapyramidal reactions (less than 1% of patients).



   Hepatic:  Aspartate transaminase (AST) and/or alanine transaminase (ALT) values exceeded twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 1% to 2% of 723 patients receiving ZOFRAN and cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy in US clinical trials. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. The role of cancer chemotherapy in these biochemical changes is unclear.



 Liver failure and death has been reported in cancer patients receiving concurrent medications, including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. The etiology of the liver failure is unclear.



   Integumentary:  Rash (approximately 1% of patients).



   Other (less than 2%):  Anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, tachycardia, angina, hypokalemia, electrocardiographic alterations, vascular occlusive events, and grand mal seizures. Except for bronchospasm and anaphylaxis, the relationship to ZOFRAN is unclear.



   Prevention of Radiation  -  induced Nausea and Vomiting  



 The most common adverse reactions (greater than or equal to 2%) reported in patients receiving ZOFRAN and concurrent radiotherapy were similar to those reported in patients receiving ZOFRAN and concurrent chemotherapy and were headache, constipation, and diarrhea.



   Prevention of Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting  



 The most common adverse reactions reported in adults in trial(s) of prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting are shown in Table 4. In these trial(s) patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications in both treatment groups.

  Urinary retention                   28 (5%)                                             18 (3%)           
  Pruritus                            27 (5%)                                             20 (4%)           
        *       a  Reported in greater than or equal to 5% of patients treated with ZOFRAN and at a rate that exceeded placebo. 
    In a crossover study with 25 subjects, headache was reported in 6 subjects administered ZOFRAN ODT with water (24%) as compared with 2 subjects administered ZOFRAN ODT without water (8%).
 

   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ondansetron. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Cardiovascular  



 Arrhythmias (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, electrocardiographic alterations (including second-degree heart block, QT/QTc interval prolongation, and ST segment depression), palpitations, and syncope. Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT interval prolongation have been reported.



   General  



 Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylactic reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, shortness of breath, hypotension, laryngeal edema, stridor) have also been reported. Laryngospasm, shock, and cardiopulmonary arrest have occurred during allergic reactions in patients receiving injectable ondansetron.



   Hepatobiliary  



 Liver enzyme abnormalities.



   Lower Respiratory  



 Hiccups.



   Neurology  



 Oculogyric crisis, appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions.



   Skin  



 Urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis.



   Eye Disorders  



 Cases of transient blindness, predominantly during intravenous administration, have been reported. These cases of transient blindness were reported to resolve within a few minutes up to 48 hours.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *     Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm: Discontinue ZOFRAN if suspected. Monitor and treat promptly per standard of care until signs and symptoms resolve. (  5.1  ) 
 *     QT interval prolongation and Torsade de Pointes : Avoid in patients with congenital long QT syndrome; monitor with electrocardiograms (ECGs) if concomitant electrolyte abnormalities, cardiac failure or arrhythmias, or use of other QT prolonging drugs. (  5.2  ) 
 *     Serotonin syndrome: Reported with 5-HT3receptor antagonists alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. If such symptoms occur, discontinue ZOFRAN and initiate supportive treatment. If concomitant use of ZOFRAN with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, patients should be made aware of a potential increased risk for serotonin syndrome. (  5.3  ) 
 *     Masking of progressive ileus and/or gastric distention following abdominal surgery or chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting : Monitor for decreased bowel activity, particularly in patients with risk factors for gastrointestinal obstruction. (  5.4  ) 
 *    Phenylketonuric patients should be informed that ZOFRAN ODT orally disintegrating tablets contain phenylalanine (a component of aspartame). Each 4-mg and 8-mg orally disintegrating tablet contains less than 0.03 mg phenylalanine. (  5.5  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions



  Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3receptor antagonists. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue use of ZOFRAN; treat promptly per standard of care and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve [see Contraindications (4)].  



    5.2 QT Prolongation



  Electrocardiogram (ECG) changes including QT interval prolongation have been seen in patients receiving ondansetron. In addition, postmarketing cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported in patients using ZOFRAN. Avoid ZOFRAN in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients taking other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].  



    5.3 Serotonin Syndrome



  The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3receptor antagonists alone. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of ZOFRAN alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center.



 Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of ZOFRAN and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue ZOFRAN and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if ZOFRAN is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Overdosage (10)]  .



    5.4 Masking of Progressive Ileus and Gastric Distension



  The use of ZOFRAN in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distension. Monitor for decreased bowel activity, particularly in patients with risk factors for gastrointestinal obstruction.



 ZOFRAN is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction.



    5.5 Phenylketonuria



  Phenylketonuric patients should be informed that ZOFRAN ODT orally disintegrating tablets contain phenylalanine (a component of aspartame). Each 4-mg and 8-mg orally disintegrating tablet contains less than 0.03 mg phenylalanine.
