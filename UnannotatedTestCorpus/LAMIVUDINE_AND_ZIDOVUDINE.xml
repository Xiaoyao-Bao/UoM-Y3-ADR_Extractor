  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.  Lamivudine plus Zidovudine Administered as Separate Formulations  In 4 randomized, controlled trials of EPIVIR 300 mg per day plus RETROVIR 600 mg per day, the following selected adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities were observed (Tables 1 and 2).

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: HEMATOLOGIC TOXICITY, MYOPATHY, LACTIC ACIDOSIS AND SEVERE HEPATOMEGALY WITH STEATOSIS, and EXACERBATIONS OF HEPATITIS B

  WARNING: HEMATOLOGIC TOXICITY, MYOPATHY, LACTIC ACIDOSIS AND SEVERE HEPATOMEGALY WITH STEATOSIS, and EXACERBATIONS OF HEPATITIS B

     Zidovudine, a component of      lamivudine and zidovudine tablets,      has been associated with     hematologic toxicity including neutropenia and severe anemia, particularly in patients with advanced Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1) disease   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ].       Prolonged use of zidovudine has been associated with symptomatic myopathy   [see           Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ].       Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been     reported with the use of nucleoside analogues, including lamivudine and zidovudine. Discontinue lamivudine and zidovudine if clinical or  laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity occur   [see       Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ].      Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are co-infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HIV-1 and have discontinued lamivudine,  which is one component of  lamivudine and zidovudine.  Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who discontinue  lamivudine and zidovudine and are co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted   [see    Warnings and Precautions (5.4)  ].

   5.1 Hematologic Toxicity/Bone Marrow Suppression



     Zidovudine, a component of lamivudine and zidovudine, has been associated with hematologic toxicity including neutropenia and anemia, particularly in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease. Lamivudine and Zidovudine should be used with caution in patients who have bone marrow compromise evidenced by granulocyte count less than 1,000 cells per mm  3  or hemoglobin less than 9.5 grams per dL [see      Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ].  Frequent blood counts are strongly recommended in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease who are treated with lamivudine and zidovudine. Periodic blood counts are recommended for other HIV-1-infected patients. If anemia or neutropenia develops, dosage interruption may be needed.
 

    5.2 Myopathy



     Myopathy and myositis, with pathological changes similar to that produced by HIV-1 disease, have been associated with prolonged use of zidovudine, and therefore may occur with therapy with lamivudine and zidovudine.
 

    5.3 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis



  Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues, including lamivudine and zidovudine. A majority of these cases have been  in  women. Female sex and obesity may be risk factors for the development of lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis in patients treated with antiretroviral nucleoside analogues. See full prescribing information for EPIVIR (lamivudine) and RETROVIR (zidovudine). Treatment with lamivudine and zidovudine should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity, which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations.



    5.4 Patients with Hepatitis B Virus Co-infection



    Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis    Clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. See full prescribing information for EPIVIR (lamivudine). Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment.
 

     Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV  Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in subjects dually infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has been reported in HIV-1-infected subjects who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. See full prescribing information for EPIVIR (lamivudine).
 

    5.5 Use with Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens



   Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and lamivudine and zidovudine should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation, neutropenia, and anemia. See full prescribing information for EPIVIR (lamivudine) and RETROVIR (zidovudine). Discontinuation of lamivudine and zidovudine should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh greater than 6) (see full prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin).  Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Coadministration of ribavirin and lamivudine and zidovudine is not advised.
 

    5.6 Pancreatitis



     Lamivudine and Zidovudine should be used with caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis. Treatment with lamivudine and zidovudine should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  
 

    5.7 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome



   Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including lamivudine and zidovudine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium  infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii  pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.  Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.
 

    5.8 Lipoatrophy



  Treatment with zidovudine,  a  component of lamivudine and zidovudine, has been associated with loss of subcutaneous fat. The incidence and severity of lipoatrophy are related to cumulative exposure. This fat loss, which is most evident in the face, limbs, and buttocks, may be only partially reversible and improvement may take months to years after switching to a non-zidovudine-containing regimen. Patients should be regularly assessed for signs of lipoatrophy during therapy with zidovudine-containing products, and if feasible, therapy should be switched to an alternative regimen if there is suspicion of lipoatrophy.
