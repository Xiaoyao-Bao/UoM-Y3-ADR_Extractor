  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be compared directly to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     Adult Population  



 During clinical development, 560 patients were exposed to CALDOLOR, 438 in pain and 122 with fever. In the pain studies, CALDOLOR was started intra-operatively and administered at a dose of 400 mg or 800 mg every six hours for up to three days. In the fever studies, CALDOLOR was administered at doses of 100 mg, 200 mg, or 400 mg every four or six hours for up to 3 days. The most frequent type of adverse reaction occurring with oral ibuprofen is gastrointestinal.



     Pain Studies  



 The incidence rates of adverse reactions listed in the following table were derived from multi-center, controlled clinical studies in post-operative patients comparing CALDOLOR to placebo in patients also receiving morphine as needed for post-operative pain.

              Fever Studies  
 

 Fever studies were conducted in febrile hospitalized patients with malaria and febrile hospitalized patients with varying causes of fever. In hospitalized febrile patients with malaria, the adverse reactions observed in at least two CALDOLOR-treated patients included abdominal pain and nasal congestion.



 In hospitalized febrile patients (all causes), adverse reactions observed in more than two patients in any given treatment group are presented in the table below.

   5.1 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events



     Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.



    To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.



    There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as ibuprofen, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [ see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2    )].



       Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery  



    Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10-14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG [see Contraindications (  4  )]  .



       Post-MI Patients  



    Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up.



    Avoid the use of CALDOLOR in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If CALDOLOR is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.



    5.2 Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation



  NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3-6 months and in about 2%-4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk.



    Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration and Perforation  



 Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.



    Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients:  



 *  Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration. 
 *  Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time. 
 *  Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs. 
 *  Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy. 
 *  If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue CALDOLOR until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. 
 *  In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [ see Drug Interactions (  7  ) ]. 
       5.3 Hepatotoxicity
 

  Elevations of ALT or AST (three or more times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) have been reported in approximately 1% of NSAID-treated patients in clinical trials. In addition, rare, sometimes fatal, cases of severe hepatic injury, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure have been reported.



 Elevations of ALT or AST (less than three times ULN) may occur in up to 15% of patients treated with NSAIDs, including ibuprofen.



 Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flu-like" symptoms).If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue CALDOLOR immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient.



    5.4 Hypertension



  NSAIDs, including CALDOLOR, can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs [ see Drug Interactions (  7  )  ].



 Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.



    5.5 Heart Failure and Edema



     The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death.



    Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of ibuprofen may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) [ see Drug Interactions (  7  )  ].



    Avoid the use of CALDOLOR in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If CALDOLOR is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure.



    5.6 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia



   Renal Toxicity  



 Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.



 Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.



 No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of CALDOLOR in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of CALDOLOR may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with preexisting renal disease.



 Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating CALDOLOR. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of CALDOLOR [ see Drug Interactions (  7  )  ]. Avoid the use of CALDOLOR in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If CALDOLOR is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.



    Hyperkalemia  



 Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.



    5.7 Anaphylactic Reactions



  Ibuprofen has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to ibuprofen and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [see Contraindications (  4  ) and Warnings and Precautions (  5.8  )  ].



 Seek emergency help if anaphylactic reaction occurs.



    5.8 Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity



  A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, CALDOLOR is contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity [ see Contraindications (  4  )  ]. When CALDOLOR is used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma.



    5.9 Serious Skin Reactions



  NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of CALDOLOR at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. CALDOLOR is contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [ see Contraindications (  4  )  ].



    5.10 Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus



  Ibuprofen may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Avoid use of NSAIDs, including CALDOLOR, in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of gestation (third trimester) [ see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  )  ].



    5.11 Hematologic Toxicity



  Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross GI blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with CALDOLOR has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit.



 NSAIDs, including CALDOLOR may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorder, concomitant use of warfarin, other anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding [ see Drug Interactions (  7  )  ].



 CALDOLOR must be diluted prior to use. Infusion of the drug product without dilution can cause hemolysis [see Dosage and Administration (  2.3  )]  .



    5.12 Masking of Inflammation and Fever



  The pharmacological activity of CALDOLOR in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.



    5.13 Laboratory Monitoring



  Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a CBC and a chemistry profile periodically [ see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  ,  5.3  ,  5.6  )  ].



    5.14 Ophthalmological Effects



  Blurred or diminished vision, scotomata, and changes in color vision have been reported with oral ibuprofen. Discontinue ibuprofen if a patient develops such complaints, and refer the patient for an ophthalmologic examination that includes central visual fields and color vision testing.



    5.15 Aseptic Meningitis



  Aseptic meningitis with fever and coma has been observed in patients on oral ibuprofen therapy. Although it is probably more likely to occur in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and related connective tissue diseases, it has been reported in patients who do not have underlying chronic disease. If signs or symptoms of meningitis develop in a patient on ibuprofen, give consideration to whether or not the signs or symptoms are related to ibuprofen therapy.
