  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rate observed in practice.



 The data described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS section reflect exposure to STIVARGA in more than 4800 patients who were enrolled in four randomized, placebo-controlled trials (n=1142), an expanded access program (CONSIGN, n=2864), or single arm clinical trials (single agent or in combination with other agents). There were 4518 patients who received STIVARGA as a single agent; the distribution of underlying malignancies was 80% CRC, 4% GIST, 10% HCC, 6% other solid tumors; and 74% were White, 11% Asian, and 15% race not known. Among these 4518 patients, 83% received STIVARGA for at least 21 days and 20% received STIVARGA for 6 months or longer.



 In randomized placebo-controlled trials (CORRECT, GRID, RESORCE and CONCUR), the most frequently observed adverse drug reactions (&gt;=20%) in patients receiving STIVARGA are pain (including gastrointestinal and abdominal pain), HFSR, asthenia/fatigue, diarrhea, decreased appetite/food intake, hypertension, infection, dysphonia, hyperbilirubinemia, fever, mucositis, weight loss, rash, and nausea.



   Colorectal Cancer  



 The safety data described below, except where noted, are derived from a randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (CORRECT) in which 500 patients (median age 61 years; 61% men) with previously-treated metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) received STIVARGA as a single agent at the dose of 160 mg daily for the first 3 weeks of each 4 week treatment cycle and 253 patients (median age 61 years; 60% men) received placebo. The median duration of therapy was 1.7 months (range 2 days, 10.8 months) for patients receiving STIVARGA. Due to adverse reactions, 61% of the patients receiving STIVARGA required a dose interruption and 38% of the patients had their dose reduced. Adverse reactions that resulted in treatment discontinuation occurred in 8.2% of STIVARGA-treated patients compared to 1.2% of patients who received placebo. Hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) and rash were the most common reasons for permanent discontinuation of STIVARGA.

   Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors  



 The safety data described below are derived from a randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (GRID) in which 132 patients (median age 60 years; 64% men) with previously-treated GIST received STIVARGA as a single agent at a dose of 160 mg daily for the first 3 weeks of each 4 week treatment cycle and 66 patients (median age 61 years; 64% men) received placebo. The median duration of therapy was 5.7 months (range 1 day, 11.7 months) for patients receiving STIVARGA. Dose interruptions for adverse events were required in 58% of patients receiving STIVARGA and 50% of patients had their dose reduced. Adverse reactions that resulted in treatment discontinuation were reported in 2.3% of STIVARGA-treated patients compared to 1.5% of patients who received placebo.

      Hepatocellular Carcinoma  
 

 The safety data described below are derived from a randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (RESORCE) in which patients with previously-treated HCC received either STIVARGA (n=374) 160 mg orally on days 1-21 of each 4 week treatment cycle or placebo (n=193). The median age was 63 years, 88% were men, 98% had Child-Pugh A cirrhosis, 66% had an ECOG performance status (PS) of 0 and 34% had PS of 1. The median duration of therapy was 3.5 months (range 1 day to 29.4 months) for patients receiving STIVARGA. Of the patients receiving STIVARGA, 33% were exposed to STIVARGA for greater than or equal to 6 months and 14% were exposed to STIVARGA for greater than or equal to 12 months. Dose interruptions for adverse events were required in 58.3% of patients receiving STIVARGA and 48% of patients had their dose reduced. The most common adverse reactions requiring dose modification (interruption or dose reduction) were HFSR/PPES (20.6%), blood bilirubin increase (5.9%), fatigue (5.1%) and diarrhea (5.3%). Adverse reactions that resulted in treatment discontinuation were reported in 10.4% of STIVARGA-treated patients compared to 3.6% of patients who received placebo; the most common adverse reactions requiring discontinuation of STIVARGA were HFSR/PPES (1.9%) and AST increased (1.6%).

   5.1 Hepatotoxicity



  Severe drug-induced liver injury with fatal outcome occurred in STIVARGA-treated patients in clinical trials. In most cases, liver dysfunction occurred within the first 2 months of therapy and was characterized by a hepatocellular pattern of injury.



 In the CORRECT study, fatal hepatic failure occurred in 1.6% of patients in the regorafenib arm and in 0.4% of patients in the placebo arm. In the GRID study ,  fatal hepatic failure occurred in 0.8% of patients in the regorafenib arm. In the RESORCE study, there was no increase in the incidence of fatal hepatic failure as compared to placebo [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  .



 Obtain liver function tests (ALT, AST, and bilirubin) before initiation of STIVARGA and monitor at least every two weeks during the first 2 months of treatment. Thereafter, monitor monthly or more frequently as clinically indicated. Monitor liver function tests weekly in patients experiencing elevated liver function tests until improvement to less than 3 times the ULN or baseline.



 Temporarily hold and then reduce or permanently discontinue STIVARGA depending on the severity and persistence of hepatotoxicity as manifested by elevated liver function tests or hepatocellular necrosis [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  ) and Use in Specific Populations (  8.6  )]  .



    5.2 Infections



  STIVARGA caused an increased risk of infections. The overall incidence of infection (Grades 1-5) was higher (32% vs. 17%) in 1142 STIVARGA-treated patients as compared to the control arm in randomized placebo-controlled trials.The incidence of grade 3 or greater infections in STIVARGA treated patients was 9%. The most common infections were urinary tract infections (5.7%), nasopharyngitis (4.0%), mucocutaneous and systemic fungal infections (3.3%) and pneumonia (2.6%). Fatal outcomes caused by infection occurred more often in patients treated with STIVARGA (1.0%) as compared to patients receiving placebo (0.3%); the most common fatal infections were respiratory (0.6% in STIVARGA-treated patients vs 0.2% in patients receiving placebo).



 Withhold STIVARGA for Grade 3 or 4 infections, or worsening infection of any grade. Resume STIVARGA at the same dose following resolution of infection [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  )]  .



    5.3 Hemorrhage



  STIVARGA caused an increased incidence of hemorrhage. The overall incidence (Grades 1-5) was 18.2% in 1142 patients treated with STIVARGA and 9.5% in patients receiving placebo in randomized, placebo-controlled trials. The incidence of grade 3 or greater hemorrhage in patients treated with STIVARGA was 3.0%. The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic events was 0.7%, involving the central nervous system or the respiratory, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary tracts.



 Permanently discontinue STIVARGA in patients with severe or life-threatening hemorrhage. Monitor INR levels more frequently in patients receiving warfarin [see Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )]  .



    5.4 Gastrointestinal Perforation or Fistula



  Gastrointestinal perforation occurred in 0.6% of 4518 patients treated with STIVARGA across all clinical trials of STIVARGA administered as a single agent; this included eight fatal events.



 Gastrointestinal fistula occurred in 0.8% of patients treated with STIVARGA and 0.2% of patients in placebo arm across randomized, placebo-controlled trials. Permanently discontinue STIVARGA in patients who develop gastrointestinal perforation or fistula.



    5.5 Dermatologic Toxicity



  In randomized, placebo-controlled trials, adverse skin reactions occurred in 71.9% of patients in the regorafenib arm and in 25.5% of patients in the placebo arm, including hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) also known as palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (PPES), and severe rash requiring dose modification.



 In the randomized, placebo-controlled trials, the overall incidence of HFSR was higher in 1142 STIVARGA-treated patients (53%) than in the placebo-treated patients (8%). Most cases of HFSR in STIVARGA-treated patients appeared during the first cycle of treatment. The incidences of Grade 3 HFSR (16% versus &lt;1%), Grade 3 rash (3% versus &lt;1%), serious adverse reactions of erythema multiforme (&lt;0.1% vs. 0%) and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (&lt;0.1% vs. 0%) were also higher in STIVARGA-treated patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]  .  Across all trials, a higher incidence of HFSR was observed in Asian patients treated with STIVARGA (all grades: 72%; Grade 3: 18%) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.8 )]  .



 Toxic epidermal necrolysis occurred in 0.02% of 4518 STIVARGA-treated patients across all clinical trials of STIVARGA administered as a single agent.



 Withhold STIVARGA, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue STIVARGA depending on the severity and persistence of dermatologic toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  )]  . Institute supportive measures for symptomatic relief.



    5.6 Hypertension



  In randomized, placebo-controlled trials, hypertensive crisis occurred in 0.2% of patients in the regorafenib arms and in none of the patients in the placebo arms. STIVARGA caused an increased incidence of hypertension (30% versus 8% in CORRECT, 59% versus 27% in GRID, and 31% versus 6% in RESORCE) [see Adverse Reactions (    6.1)].  The onset of hypertension occurred during the first cycle of treatment in most patients who developed hypertension (67% in randomized, placebo-controlled trials).



 Do not initiate STIVARGA unless blood pressure is adequately controlled. Monitor blood pressure weekly for the first 6 weeks of treatment and then every cycle, or more frequently, as clinically indicated. Temporarily or permanently withhold STIVARGA for severe or uncontrolled hypertension [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  )].  



    5.7 Cardiac Ischemia and Infarction



  STIVARGA increased the incidence of myocardial ischemia and infarction (0.9% vs 0.2%) in randomized placebo-controlled trials [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . Withhold STIVARGA in patients who develop new or acute onset cardiac ischemia or infarction. Resume STIVARGA only after resolution of acute cardiac ischemic events, if the potential benefits outweigh the risks of further cardiac ischemia.



    5.8 Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome



  Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS), a syndrome of subcortical vasogenic edema diagnosed by characteristic finding on MRI, occurred in one of 4800 STIVARGA-treated patients across all clinical trials. Perform an evaluation for RPLS in any patient presenting with seizures, severe headache, visual disturbances, confusion or altered mental function. Discontinue STIVARGA in patients who develop RPLS.



    5.9 Wound Healing Complications



  No formal studies of the effect of regorafenib on wound healing have been conducted. Since vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitors such as STIVARGA can impair wound healing, discontinue treatment with STIVARGA at least 2 weeks prior to scheduled surgery. The decision to resume STIVARGA after surgery should be based on clinical judgment of adequate wound healing. Discontinue STIVARGA in patients with wound dehiscence.



    5.10 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  Based on animal studies and its mechanism of action, STIVARGA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data on STIVARGA use in pregnant women. Regorafenib was embryolethal and teratogenic in rats and rabbits at exposures lower than human exposures at the recommended dose, with increased incidences of cardiovascular, genitourinary, and skeletal malformations. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.



 Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with STIVARGA and for 2 months after the final dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with STIVARGA and for 2 months after the final dose [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  ), (  8.3  )]  .
