  The most common adverse effects are gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, anorexia) and allergic skin reactions (such as rash and urticaria).  FATALITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF SULFONAMIDES, ALTHOUGH RARE, HAVE OCCURRED DUE TO SEVERE REACTIONS, INCLUDING STEVENS-JOHNSON SYNDROME, TOXIC EPIDERMAL NECROLYSIS, FULMINANT HEPATIC NECROSIS, AGRANULOCYTOSIS, APLASTIC ANEMIA AND OTHER BLOOD DYSCRASIAS (SEE    WARNINGS    SECTION).  



   Hematologic:

  Agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, hemolytic anemia, megaloblastic anemia, hypoprothrombinemia, methemoglobinemia, eosinophilia.



   Allergic Reactions:

  Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, anaphylaxis, allergic myocarditis, erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, angioedema, drug fever, chills, Henoch-Schoenlein purpura, serum sickness-like syndrome, generalized allergic reactions, generalized skin eruptions, photosensitivity, conjunctival and scleral injection, pruritus, urticaria and rash. In addition, periarteritis nodosa and systemic lupus erythematosus have been reported.



   Gastrointestinal:

  Hepatitis (including cholestatic jaundice and hepatic necrosis), elevation of serum transaminase and bilirubin, pseudomembranous enterocolitis, pancreatitis, stomatitis, glossitis, nausea, emesis, abdominal pains, diarrhea, anorexia.



   Genitourinary:

  Renal failure, interstitial nephritis, BUN and serum creatinine elevation, toxic nephrosis with oliguria and anuria, and crystalluria.



   Neurologic:

  Aseptic meningitis, convulsions, peripheral neuritis, ataxia, vertigo, tinnitus, headache.



   Psychiatric:

  Hallucinations, depression, apathy, nervousness.



   Endocrine:

  The sulfonamides bear certain chemical similarities to some goitrogens, diuretics (acetazolamide and the thiazides) and oral hypoglycemic agents. Cross-sensitivity may exist with these agents. Diuresis and hypoglycemia have occurred rarely in patients receiving sulfonamides.



   Musculoskeletal:  



 Arthralgia and myalgia.



   Respiratory:

  Pulmonary infiltrates.



   Miscellaneous:

  Weakness, fatigue, insomnia.

   General



  Prescribing Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Oral Suspension in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.



 Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Oral Suspension should be given with caution to patients with impaired renal or hepatic function, to those with possible folate deficiency (e.g., the elderly, chronic alcoholics, patients receiving anticonvulsant therapy, patients with malabsorption syndrome, and patients in malnutrition states) and to those with severe allergies or bronchial asthma. In glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficient individuals, hemolysis may occur. This reaction is frequently dose-related.



    Use In The Elderly:



  There may be an increased risk of severe adverse reactions in elderly patients, particularly when complicating conditions exist, e.g., impaired kidney and/or liver function, or concomitant use of other drugs. Severe skin reactions, generalized bone marrow suppression (see  WARNINGS  and  ADVERSE REACTIONS  sections) or a specific decrease in platelets (with or without purpura) are the most frequently reported severe adverse reactions in elderly patients. In those concurrently receiving certain diuretics, primarily thiazides, an increased incidence of thrombocytopenia with purpura has been reported. Appropriate dosage adjustments should be made for patients with impaired kidney function (see  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section  ).



  Use In The Treatment Of And Prophylaxis For Pneumocystis Carinii Pneumonia In Patients With Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS):  



 AIDS patients may not tolerate or respond to sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim oral suspension in the same manner as non-AIDS patients. The incidence of side effects, particularly rash, fever, leukopenia and elevated aminotransferase (transaminase) values with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim therapy in AIDS patients who are being treated for Pneumocystic carinii  pneumonia has been reported to be greatly increased compared with the incidence normally associated with the use of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in non-AIDS patients. Adverse effects are generally less severe in patients receiving sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim for prophylaxis. A history of mild intolerance to sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in AIDS patients does not appear to predict intolerance of subsequent secondary prophylaxis.  5  However, if a patient develops skin rash or any sign of adverse reaction, therapy with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim oral suspension should be reevaluated (see  WARNINGS  ).



    Information for Patients



  Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Oral Suspension should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Oral Suspension is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Oral Suspension or other antibacterial drugs in the future.



 Patients should be instructed to maintain an adequate fluid intake in order to prevent crystalluria and stone formation.



    Laboratory Tests



  Complete blood counts should be done frequently in patients receiving sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim; if a significant reduction in the count of any formed blood element is noted, this drug product should be discontinued. Urinalysis with careful microscopic examination and renal function tests should be performed during therapy, particularly for those patients with impaired renal function.



    Drug Interactions



  In elderly patients concurrently receiving certain diuretics, primarily thiazides, an increased incidence of thrombocytopenia with purpura has been reported.



 It has been reported that sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim may prolong the prothrombin time in patients who are receiving the anticoagulant warfarin. This interaction should be kept in mind when sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim oral suspension is given to patients already on anticoagulant therapy, and the coagulation time should be reassessed.



 Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim may inhibit the hepatic metabolism of phenytoin. Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, given at a common clinical dosage, increased the phenytoin half-life by 39% and decreased the phenytoin metabolic clearance rate by 27%. When administering these drugs concurrently, one should be alert for possible excessive phenytoin effect.



 Sulfonamides can also displace methotrexate from plasma protein binding sites, thus increasing free methotrexate concentrations.



    Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions



  This combination product, specifically the trimethoprim component, can interfere with a serum methotrexate assay as determined by the competitive binding protein technique (CBPA) when a bacterial dihydrofolate reductase is used as the binding protein. No interference occurs, however, if methotrexate is measured by a radioimmunoassay (RIA).



 The presence of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim may also interfere with the Jaffe alkaline picrate reaction assay for creatinine, resulting in overestimations of about 10% in the range of normal values.



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility



   Carcinogenesis:



  Long-term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential have not been conducted with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim.



    Mutagenesis:



  Bacterial mutagenic studies have not been performed with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in combination. Trimethoprim was demonstrated to be nonmutagenic in the Ames assay. No chromosomal damage was observed in human leukocytes in vitro with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim alone or in combination; the concentrations used exceeded blood levels of these compounds following therapy with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. Observations of leukocytes obtained from patients treated with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim revealed no chromosomal abnormalities.



    Impairment Of Fertility:



  No adverse effects on fertility or general reproductive performance were observed in rats given oral dosages as high as 70 mg/kg/day trimethoprim plus 350 mg/kg/day sulfamethoxazole.



    Pregnancy



   Teratogenic Effects



  Pregnancy Category C .  In rats, oral doses of 533 mg/kg sulfamethoxazole or 200 mg/kg trimethoprim produced teratological effects manifested mainly as cleft palates.



 The highest dose which did not cause cleft palates in rats was 512 mg/kg sulfamethoxazole or 192 mg/kg trimethoprim when administered separately. In two studies in rats, no teratology was observed when 512 mg/kg of sulfamethoxazole was used in combination with 128 mg/kg of trimethoprim. In one study, however, cleft palates were observed in one litter out of 9 when 355 mg/kg of sulfamethoxazole was used in combination with 88 mg/kg of trimethoprim.



 In some rabbit studies, an overall increase in fetal loss (dead and resorbed and malformed conceptuses) was associated with doses of trimethoprim 6 times the human therapeutic dose.



 While there are no large, well-controlled studies on the use of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in pregnant women, Brumfitt and Pursell  6  , in a retrospective study, reported the outcome of 186 pregnancies during which the mother received either placebo or sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. The incidence of congenital abnormalities was 4 .  5% (3 of 66) in those who received placebo and 3 .  3% (4 of 120) in those receiving sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. There were no abnormalities in the 10 children whose mothers received the drug during the first trimester. In a separate survey, Brumfitt and Pursell also found no congenital abnormalities in 35 children whose mothers had received oral sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim at the time of conception or shortly thereafter.



 Because sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim may interfere with folic acid metabolism, this product should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.



    Nonteratogenic Effects



  See  CONTRAINDICATIONS  section.



    Nursing Mothers



  See  CONTRAINDICATIONS  section.



    Pediatric Use



  Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Oral Suspension is not recommended for pediatric patients younger than 2 months of age (see  INDICATIONS AND USAGE  and  CONTRAINDICATIONS  sections).

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings">    WARNINGS



   FATALITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF SULFONAMIDES, ALTHOUGH RARE, HAVE OCCURRED DUE TO SEVERE REACTIONS, INCLUDING STEVENS-JOHNSON SYNDROME, TOXIC EPIDERMAL NECROLYSIS, FULMINANT HEPATIC NECROSIS, AGRANULOCYTOSIS, APLASTIC ANEMIA AND OTHER BLOOD DYSCRASIAS.  



  SULFAMETHOXAZOLE AND TRIMETHOPRIM ORAL SUSPENSION SHOULD BE DISCONTINUED AT THE FIRST APPEARANCE OF SKIN RASH OR ANY SIGN OF ADVERSE REACTION.  Clinical signs, such as rash, sore throat, fever, arthralgia, cough, shortness of breath, pallor, purpura or jaundice may be early indications of serious reactions. In rare instances a skin rash may be followed by more severe reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, hepatic necrosis or serious blood disorder. Complete blood counts should be done frequently in patients receiving sulfonamides.



  SULFAMETHOXAZOLE AND TRIMETHOPRIM ORAL SUSPENSION SHOULD NOT BE USED IN THE TREATMENT OF STREPTOCOCCAL PHARYNGITIS.  Clinical studies have documented that patients with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis have a greater incidence of bacteriologic failure when treated with this combination than do those patients treated with penicillin, as evidenced by failure to eradicate this organism from the tonsillopharyngeal area.
