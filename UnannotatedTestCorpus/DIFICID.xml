  EXCERPT:   The most common adverse reactions are nausea (11%), vomiting (7%), abdominal pain (6%), gastrointestinal hemorrhage (4%), anemia (2%), and neutropenia (2%). (  6  )  To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck &amp; Co., Inc., at 1-877-888-4231 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.  



 

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The safety of DIFICID 200 mg tablets taken twice a day for 10 days was evaluated in 564 patients with CDAD in two active- comparator controlled trials with 86.7% of patients receiving a full course of treatment.



 Thirty-three patients receiving DIFICID (5.9%) withdrew from trials as a result of adverse reactions (AR). The types of AR resulting in withdrawal from the study varied considerably. Vomiting was the primary adverse reaction leading to discontinuation of dosing; this occurred at an incidence of 0.5% in both the fidaxomicin and vancomycin patients in Phase 3 studies.

         The following adverse reactions were reported in &lt;2% of patients taking DIFICID tablets in controlled trials:
 

   Gastrointestinal Disorders:  abdominal distension, abdominal tenderness, dyspepsia, dysphagia, flatulence, intestinal obstruction, megacolon



   Investigations:  increased blood alkaline phosphatase, decreased blood bicarbonate, increased hepatic enzymes, decreased platelet count



   Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders:  hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis



   Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders:  drug eruption, pruritus, rash



   6.2 Post Marketing Experience

  Adverse reactions reported in the post marketing setting arise from a population of unknown size and are voluntary in nature. As such, reliability in estimating their frequency or in establishing a causal relationship to drug exposure is not always possible.



 Hypersensitivity reactions (dyspnea, angioedema, rash, and pruritus) have been reported.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  DIFICID should not be used for systemic infections. (  5.1  ) 
 *  Acute hypersensitivity reactions (angioedema, dyspnea, pruritus, and rash) have been reported. In the event of a severe reaction, discontinue DIFICID. (  5.2  ) 
 *  Development of drug-resistant bacteria: Only use DIFICID for infection proven or strongly suspected to be caused by C. difficile . (  5.3  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Not for Systemic Infections



  Since there is minimal systemic absorption of fidaxomicin, DIFICID is not effective for treatment of systemic infections.



    5.2 Hypersensitivity Reactions



  Acute hypersensitivity reactions, including dyspnea, rash pruritus, and angioedema of the mouth, throat, and face have been reported with fidaxomicin. If a severe hypersensitivity reaction occurs, DIFICID  (r)  should be discontinued and appropriate therapy should be instituted.



 Some patients with hypersensitivity reactions also reported a history of allergy to other macrolides. Physicians prescribing DIFICID to patients with a known macrolide allergy should be aware of the possibility of hypersensitivity reactions.



    5.3 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria



  Prescribing DIFICID in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected C. difficile  infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.
