  The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:



 *  Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events [ see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  ) ] 
 *  GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation [ see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  ) ] 
 *  Hepatotoxicity [ see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  ) ] 
 *  Hypertension [ see Warnings and Precautions (  5.4  ) ] 
 *  Heart Failure and Edema [ see Warnings and Precautions (  5.5  ) ] 
 *  Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia [ see Warnings and Precautions (  5.6  ) ] 
 *  Anaphylactic Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions (  5.7  ) ] 
 *  Serious Skin Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions (  5.9  ) ] 
 *  Hematologic Toxicity [ see Warnings and Precautions (  5.11  ) ] 
   *  Most common (&gt;=5% and greater than placebo) adverse events in adults are diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infections, dyspepsia, and influenza-like symptoms (  6.1  ) 
 *  Adverse events observed in pediatric studies were similar in nature to the adult clinical trial experience (  6.1  )

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



   Adults  



   Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis  



 The MOBIC Phase 2/3 clinical trial database includes 10,122 OA patients and 1012 RA patients treated with MOBIC 7.5 mg/day, 3505 OA patients and 1351 RA patients treated with MOBIC 15 mg/day. MOBIC at these doses was administered to 661 patients for at least 6 months and to 312 patients for at least one year. Approximately 10,500 of these patients were treated in ten placebo- and/or active-controlled osteoarthritis trials and 2363 of these patients were treated in ten placebo- and/or active-controlled rheumatoid arthritis trials. Gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events were the most frequently reported adverse events in all treatment groups across MOBIC trials.



 A 12-week multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial was conducted in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip to compare the efficacy and safety of MOBIC with placebo and with an active control. Two 12-week multicenter, double-blind, randomized trials were conducted in patients with rheumatoid arthritis to compare the efficacy and safety of MOBIC with placebo.



 Table 1a depicts adverse events that occurred in &gt;=2% of the MOBIC treatment groups in a 12-week placebo- and active-controlled osteoarthritis trial.



 Table 1b depicts adverse events that occurred in &gt;=2% of the MOBIC treatment groups in two 12-week placebo-controlled rheumatoid arthritis trials.

      Higher doses of MOBIC (22.5 mg and greater) have been associated with an increased risk of serious GI events; therefore, the daily dose of MOBIC should not exceed 15 mg.
 

   Pediatrics  



   Pauciarticular and Polyarticular Course Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis (JRA)  



 Three hundred and eighty-seven patients with pauciarticular and polyarticular course JRA were exposed to MOBIC with doses ranging from 0.125 to 0.375 mg/kg per day in three clinical trials. These studies consisted of two 12-week multicenter, double-blind, randomized trials (one with a 12-week open-label extension and one with a 40-week extension) and one 1-year open-label PK study. The adverse events observed in these pediatric studies with MOBIC were similar in nature to the adult clinical trial experience, although there were differences in frequency. In particular, the following most common adverse events, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, and pyrexia, were more common in the pediatric than in the adult trials. Rash was reported in seven (&lt;2%) patients receiving MOBIC. No unexpected adverse events were identified during the course of the trials. The adverse events did not demonstrate an age or gender-specific subgroup effect.



 The following is a list of adverse drug reactions occurring in &lt;2% of patients receiving MOBIC in clinical trials involving approximately 16,200 patients.

        6.2 Postmarketing Experience
   The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of MOBIC. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions about whether to include an adverse event from spontaneous reports in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the event, (2) number of reports, or (3) strength of causal relationship to the drug. Adverse reactions reported in worldwide post marketing experience or the literature include: acute urinary retention; agranulocytosis; alterations in mood (such as mood elevation); anaphylactoid reactions including shock; erythema multiforme; exfoliative dermatitis; interstitial nephritis; jaundice; liver failure; Stevens-Johnson syndrome; toxic epidermal necrolysis, and infertility female.

   5.1 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events



   Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.  



  To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.  



  There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as meloxicam, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [ see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )  ].  



    Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery    Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10-14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG [ see Contraindications (  4  )  ].  
 

    Post-MI Patients    Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up.  
 

  Avoid the use of MOBIC in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If MOBIC is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.  



    5.2 Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation



  NSAIDs, including meloxicam, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3-6 months, and in about 2-4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk.



   Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation    Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.
 

  Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients:  



 *  Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration. 
 *  Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time. 
 *  Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs. 
 *  Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy. 
 *  If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue MOBIC until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. 
 *  In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [ see Drug Interactions (  7  ) ]. 
       5.3 Hepatotoxicity
 

  Elevations of ALT or AST (three or more times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) have been reported in approximately 1% of NSAID-treated patients in clinical trials. In addition, rare, sometimes fatal, cases of severe hepatic injury, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure have been reported.



 Elevations of ALT or AST (less than three times ULN) may occur in up to 15% of patients treated with NSAIDs including meloxicam.



 Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flu-like" symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue MOBIC immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient [ see Use in Specific Populations (  8.6  ) and Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )  ].



    5.4 Hypertension



  NSAIDs, including MOBIC, can lead to new onset or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs [ see Drug Interactions (  7  )  ].



 Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.



    5.5 Heart Failure and Edema



   The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death.  



  Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of meloxicam may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) [ see Drug Interactions (  7  )  ].  



  Avoid the use of MOBIC in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If MOBIC is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure.  



    5.6 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia



   Renal Toxicity  



 Long-term administration of NSAIDs, including MOBIC, has resulted in renal papillary necrosis, renal insufficiency, acute renal failure, and other renal injury.



 Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.



 The renal effects of MOBIC may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with preexisting renal disease. Because some MOBIC metabolites are excreted by the kidney, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.



 Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating MOBIC. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of MOBIC [ see Drug Interactions (  7  )  ].



 No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of MOBIC in patients with advanced renal disease. Avoid the use of MOBIC in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If MOBIC is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function [ see Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )  ].



  Hyperkalemia  



 Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.



    5.7 Anaphylactic Reactions



  Meloxicam has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to meloxicam and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [ see Contraindications (  4  ) and Warnings and Precautions (  5.8  )  ].



 Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs.



    5.8 Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity



  A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, MOBIC is contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity [ see Contraindications (  4  )  ]. When MOBIC is used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma.



    5.9 Serious Skin Reactions



  NSAIDs, including meloxicam, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of MOBIC at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. MOBIC is contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [ see Contraindications (  4  )  ].



    5.10 Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus



  Meloxicam may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Avoid use of NSAIDs, including MOBIC, in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of gestation (third trimester) [ see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  )  ].



    5.11 Hematologic Toxicity



  Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with MOBIC has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit.



 NSAIDs, including MOBIC, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders or concomitant use of warfarin, other anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding [ see Drug Interactions (  7  )  ].



    5.12 Masking of Inflammation and Fever



  The pharmacological activity of MOBIC in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.



    5.13 Laboratory Monitoring



  Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a CBC and a chemistry profile periodically [ see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  ,  5.3  ,  5.6  )  ].
