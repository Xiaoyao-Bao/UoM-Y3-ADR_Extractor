  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 A total of 1716 subjects were evaluated in pre-market clinical trials of activated DEFINITY. In this group, 1063 (61.9%) were male and 653 (38.1%) were female, 1328 (77.4%) were White, 258 (15.0%) were Black, 74 (4.3%) were Hispanic, and 56 (3.3%) were classified as other racial or ethnic groups. The mean age was 56.1 years (range 18 to 93). Of these, 144 (8.4%) had at least one adverse reaction (Table 1). There were 26 serious adverse events and 15 (0.9%) subjects discontinued because of an adverse event.



     Serious Adverse Reactions  



 Among the 1716 study patients, 19 (1.1%) suffered serious cardiopulmonary adverse reactions.



 For all adverse reactions, the overall incidence of adverse experiences was similar for the &lt;65 year age group and the &gt; 65 year age group, similar in males and in females, similar among all racial or ethnic groups, and similar for bolus and infusion dosing. Table 1 summarizes the most common adverse reactions.

   Digestive:  Dyspepsia, dry mouth, tongue disorder, toothache, abdominal pain, diarrhea and vomiting



   Hematology:  Granulocytosis, leukocytosis, leukopenia, and eosinophilia



   Musculoskeletal:  Arthralgia



   Nervous System:  Leg cramps, hypertonia, vertigo and paresthesia



   Platelet, Bleeding, and Clotting:  Hematoma



   Respiratory:  Coughing, hypoxia, pharyngitis, rhinitis and dyspnea



   Special Senses:  Decreased hearing, conjunctivitis, abnormal vision and taste perversion



   Skin:  Pruritus, rash, erythematous rash, urticaria, increased sweating, and dry skin



   Urinary:  Albuminuria



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  In a prospective, multicenter, open-label registry of 1053 patients receiving DEFINITY in routine clinical practice, heart rate, respiratory rate, and pulse oximetry were monitored for 30 minutes after DEFINITY administration. No deaths or serious adverse reactions were reported, suggesting that these reactions are unlikely to occur at a rate of more than 0.3% when DEFINITY is used according to recommendations.



 The following adverse reactions have been identified during the post-marketing use of perflutren-containing microsphere products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 Fatal cardiopulmonary and hypersensitivity reactions and other serious but non-fatal adverse reactions were uncommonly reported. These reactions typically occurred within 30 minutes of DEFINITY administration. These serious reactions may be increased among patients with unstable cardiopulmonary conditions (acute myocardial infarction, acute coronary artery syndromes, worsening or unstable congestive heart failure, or serious ventricular arrhythmias [  see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1  ,  5.2  )  ].



 Reported reactions included:



     Cardiopulmonary  



 Fatal cardiac or respiratory arrest, shock, syncope, symptomatic arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia), hypertension, hypotension, dyspnea, hypoxia, chest pain, respiratory distress, stridor, wheezing.



     Hypersensitivity  



 Anaphylactic reaction, anaphylactic shock, bronchospasm, throat tightness, angioedema, edema (pharyngeal, palatal, mouth, peripheral, localized), swelling (face, eye, lip, tongue, upper airway), facial hypoesthesia, rash, urticaria, pruritus, flushing, erythema.



     Neurologic  



 Coma, loss of consciousness, convulsion, seizure, transient ischemic attack, agitation, tremor, vision blurred, dizziness, headache, fatigue.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: SERIOUS CARDIOPULMONARY REACTIONS

    WARNING: SERIOUS CARDIOPULMONARY REACTIONS  

  Serious cardiopulmonary reactions, including fatalities, have occurred uncommonly during or following perflutren-containing microsphere administration [  see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)    ].  Most serious reactions occur within 30 minutes of administration.



 *  Assess all patients for the presence of any condition that precludes DEFINITY administration [see Contraindications (4)]. 
 *  Always have resuscitation equipment and trained personnel readily available. 
      EXCERPT:   WARNING: SERIOUS CARDIOPULMONARY REACTIONS
 

   See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning  



 Serious cardiopulmonary reactions, including fatalities, have occurred uncommonly during or following perflutren-containing microsphere administration (  5.1  ).  Most serious reactions occur within 30 minutes of administration.



 *  Assess all patients for the presence of any condition that precludes DEFINITY administration (4). 
 *  Always have resuscitation equipment and trained personnel readily available.

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



  EXCERPT:   Serious cardiopulmonary reactions, including fatalities, have occurred during or following perflutren-containing microsphere administration. (  5.1  )



 Serious acute hypersensitivity reactions have occurred in patients with no prior exposure to perflutren-containing microsphere products (  5.2  ,  6  ).



 Always have cardiopulmonary resuscitation personnel and equipment readily available prior to DEFINITY administration and monitor all patients for acute reactions (  5.1  ,  5.2  ).



 



   5.1 Serious Cardiopulmonary Reactions



  Serious cardiopulmonary reactions including fatalities have occurred uncommonly during or shortly following perflutren-containing microsphere administration, typically within 30 minutes of administration. The risk for these reactions may be increased among patients with unstable cardiopulmonary conditions (acute myocardial infarction, acute coronary artery syndromes, worsening or unstable congestive heart failure, or serious ventricular arrhythmias). Always have cardiopulmonary resuscitation personnel and equipment readily available prior to DEFINITY administration and monitor all patients for acute reactions.



 The reported reactions include: fatal cardiac or respiratory arrest, shock, syncope, symptomatic arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia), hypertension, hypotension, dyspnea, hypoxia, chest pain, respiratory distress, stridor, wheezing, loss of consciousness, and convulsions [ see  Adverse Reactions (6)    ].



    5.2 Hypersensitivity Reactions



  In postmarketing use, serious hypersensitivity reactions were observed during or shortly following perflutren-containing microsphere administration including:



 Shock, bronchospasm, throat tightness, angioedema, edema (pharyngeal, palatal, mouth, peripheral, localized), swelling (face, eye, lip, tongue, upper airway), facial hypoesthesia, rash, urticaria, pruritus, flushing, and erythema have occurred in patients with no prior exposure to perflutren-containing microsphere products [ see  Adverse Reactions (6)    ]. Always have cardiopulmonary resuscitation personnel and equipment readily available prior to DEFINITY administration and monitor all patients for hypersensitivity reactions.



    5.3 Systemic Embolization



   When administering DEFINITY to patients with a cardiac shunt, the microspheres can bypass filtering by the lung and enter the arterial circulation. Assess patients with shunts for embolic phenomena following DEFINITY administration. DEFINITY is only for intravenous administration; do not administer DEFINITY by intra-arterial injection [ see  Dosage and Administration (2.1)    ].  



    5.4 Ventricular Arrhythmia Related to High Mechanical Index



  High ultrasound mechanical index values may cause microsphere cavitation or rupture and lead to ventricular arrhythmias. Additionally, end-systolic triggering with high mechanical indices has been reported to cause ventricular arrhythmias. DEFINITY is not recommended for use at mechanical indices greater than 0.8 [ see  Dosage and Administration (2)    ].
