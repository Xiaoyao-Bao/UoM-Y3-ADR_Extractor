  The most frequently occurring side effects of  Dantrium  have been drowsiness, dizziness, weakness, general malaise, fatigue, and diarrhea. These are generally transient, occurring early in treatment, and can often be obviated by beginning with a low dose and increasing dosage gradually until an optimal regimen is established. Diarrhea may be severe and may necessitate temporary withdrawal of  Dantrium  therapy. If diarrhea recurs upon readministration of  Dantrium  , therapy should probably be withdrawn permanently.



 Other less frequent side effects, listed according to system, are:



   Gastrointestinal:  Constipation, rarely progressing to signs of intestinal obstruction, GI bleeding, anorexia, swallowing difficulty, gastric irritation, abdominal cramps, nausea and/or vomiting.



   Hepatobiliary:  Hepatitis (see    WARNINGS    ).



   Neurologic:  Speech disturbance, seizure, headache, light-headedness, visual disturbance, diplopia, alteration of taste, insomnia, drooling.



   Cardiovascular:  Tachycardia, erratic blood pressure, phlebitis, heart failure.



   Hematologic:  Aplastic anemia, anemia, leukopenia, lymphocytic lymphoma, thrombocytopenia.



   Psychiatric:  Mental depression, mental confusion, increased nervousness.



   Urogenital:  Increased urinary frequency, crystalluria, hematuria, difficult erection, urinary incontinence and/or nocturia, difficult urination and/or urinary retention.



   Integumentary:  Abnormal hair growth, acne-like rash, pruritus, urticaria, eczematoid eruption, sweating.



   Musculoskeletal:  Myalgia, backache.



   Respiratory:  Feeling of suffocation, respiratory depression.



   Special Senses:  Excessive tearing.



   Hypersensitivity:  Pleural effusion with pericarditis, pleural effusion with associated eosinophilia, anaphylaxis.



   Other:  Chills and fever.



 The published literature has included some reports of  Dantrium  use in patients with Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS).  Dantrium  capsules are not indicated for the treatment of NMS and patients may expire despite treatment with  Dantrium  capsules.

    BOXED WARNING: 

  

    Dantrium   (dantrolene sodium) has a potential for hepatotoxicity, and should not be used in conditions other than those recommended.  Symptomatic hepatitis (fatal and non-fatal) has been reported at various dose levels of the drug.  The incidence reported in patients taking up to 400 mg/day is much lower than in those taking doses of 800 mg or more per day.  Even sporadic short courses of these higher dose levels within a treatment regimen markedly increased the risk of serious hepatic injury.  Liver dysfunction as evidenced by blood chemical abnormalities alone (liver enzyme elevations) has been observed in patients exposed to   Dantrium   for varying periods of time.  Overt hepatitis has occurred at varying intervals after initiation of therapy, but has been most frequently observed between the third and twelfth month of therapy.  The risk of hepatic injury appears to be greater in females, in patients over 35 years of age, and in patients taking other medication(s) in addition to   Dantrium   (dantrolene sodium). Spontaneous reports suggest a higher proportion of hepatic events with fatal outcome in elderly patients receiving Dantrium.  However, the majority of these cases were complicated with confounding factors such as intercurrent illnesses and/or concomitant potentially hepatotoxic medications (see   Geriatric Use   subsection).   Dantrium   should be used only in conjunction with appropriate monitoring of hepatic function including frequent determination of SGOT or SGPT.  If no observable benefit is derived from the administration of   Dantrium   after a total of 45 days, therapy should be discontinued.  The lowest possible effective dose for the individual patient should be prescribed.

    <Section id="S3" name="precautions">    PRECAUTIONS



   Dantrium  should be used with caution in patients with impaired pulmonary function, particularly those with obstructive pulmonary disease, and in patients with severely impaired cardiac function due to myocardial disease. Dantrium  is associated with pleural effusion with associated eosinophilia. It should be used with caution in patients with a history of previous liver disease or dysfunction (see   WARNINGS    ).



    Information for Patients



  Patients should be cautioned against driving a motor vehicle or participating in hazardous occupations while taking Dantrium  . Caution should be exercised in the concomitant administration of tranquilizing agents.



  Dantrium  might possibly evoke a photosensitivity reaction; patients should be cautioned about exposure to sunlight while taking it.
</Section>
    <Section id="S4" name="warnings">    WARNINGS



  It is important to recognize that fatal and non-fatal liver disorders of an idiosyncratic or hypersensitivity type may occur with Dantrium  therapy.



 At the start of Dantrium  therapy, it is desirable to do liver function studies (SGOT, SGPT, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin) for a baseline or to establish whether there is pre-existing liver disease. If baseline liver abnormalities exist and are confirmed, there is a clear possibility that the potential for Dantrium  hepatotoxicity could be enhanced, although such a possibility has not yet been established.



 Liver function studies (e.g., SGOT or SGPT) should be performed at appropriate intervals during Dantrium  therapy. If such studies reveal abnormal values, therapy should generally be discontinued. Only where benefits of the drug have been of major importance to the patient, should reinitiation or continuation of therapy be considered. Some patients have revealed a return to normal laboratory values in the face of continued therapy while others have not.



 If symptoms compatible with hepatitis, accompanied by abnormalities in liver function tests or jaundice appear, Dantrium  should be discontinued. If caused by Dantrium  and detected early, the abnormalities in liver function characteristically have reverted to normal when the drug was discontinued.  Dantrium  therapy has been reinstituted in a few patients who have developed clinical and/or laboratory evidence of hepatocellular injury. If such reinstitution of therapy is done, it should be attempted only in patients who clearly need Dantrium  and only after previous symptoms and laboratory abnormalities have cleared. The patient should be hospitalized and the drug should be restarted in very small and gradually increasing doses. Laboratory monitoring should be frequent and the drug should be withdrawn immediately if there is any indication of recurrent liver involvement. Some patients have reacted with unmistakable signs of liver abnormality upon administration of a challenge dose, while others have not.



  Dantrium  should be used with particular caution in females and in patients over 35 years of age in view of apparent greater likelihood of drug-induced, potentially fatal, hepatocellular disease in these groups. Spontaneous reports suggest a higher proportion of hepatic events with fatal outcome in elderly patients receiving Dantrium.  However, the majority of these cases were complicated with confounding factors such as intercurrent illnesses and/or concomitant potentially hepatotoxic medications (see  Geriatric Use  subsection).



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility



  Long-term safety of Dantrium  in humans has not been established. Chronic studies in rats, dogs, and monkeys at dosages greater than 30 mg/kg/day showed growth or weight depression and signs of hepatopathy and possible occlusion nephropathy, all of which were reversible upon cessation of treatment. Sprague-Dawley female rats fed dantrolene sodium for 18 months at dosage levels of 15, 30, and 60 mg/kg/day showed an increased incidence of benign and malignant mammary tumors compared with concurrent controls. At the highest dose level, there was an increase in the incidence of benign lymphatic neoplasms. In a 30-month study at the same dose levels also in Sprague-Dawley rats, dantrolene sodium produced a decrease in the time of onset of mammary neoplasms. Female rats at the highest dose level showed an increased incidence of hepatic lymphangiomas and hepatic angiosarcomas.



 The only drug-related effect seen in a 30-month study in Fischer-344 rats was a dose-related reduction in the time of onset of mammary and testicular tumors. A 24-month study in HaM/ICR mice revealed no evidence of carcinogenic activity. Carcinogenicity in humans cannot be fully excluded, so that this possible risk of chronic administration must be weighed against the benefits of the drug (i.e., after a brief trial) for the individual patient.



 Dantrolene sodium has produced positive results in the Ames S. Typhimurium bacterial mutagenesis assay in the presence and absence of a liver activating system.



    Pregnancy



   Pregnancy Category C



  Adequate animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Dantrium  . It is also not known whether Dantrium  can cause fatal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Dantrium  should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.



    Labor and Delivery



  In one non-randomized open-label study, 21 term pregnant patients received prophylactic oral Dantrium  100 mg per day for 2 to 10 days prior to delivery. Dantrolene readily crossed the placenta with maternal and fetal whole blood levels approximately equal at delivery; neonatal levels then fell approximately 50% per day for 2 days before declining sharply. No neonatal respiratory and neuromuscular side effects were detected at low dose. More data, at higher doses, are needed before more definitive conclusions can be made.



    Nursing Mothers



   Dantrium  should not be used in nursing mothers.



    Usage in Pediatric Patients



  The long-term safety of Dantrium  in pediatric patients under the age of 5 years has not been established. Because of the possibility that adverse effects of the drug could become apparent only after many years, a benefit-risk consideration of the long-term use of Dantrium  is particularly important in pediatric patients.



    Geriatric Use



  Clinical studies of Dantrium  did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience in the literature has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. As with all patients receiving Dantrium  , it is recommended that elderly patients receive the lowest dose compatible with the optimal response. Spontaneous reports suggest a higher proportion of hepatic events with fatal outcome in elderly patients receiving Dantrium  . However, the majority of these cases were complicated with confounding factors such as intercurrent illnesses and/or concomitant potentially hepatotoxic medications (for hepatotoxicity details and its management see  Black Box  and  Warnings  Sections).



    Drug Interactions



  Drowsiness may occur with Dantrium  therapy, and the concomitant administration of CNS depressants such as sedatives and tranquilizing agents may result in further drowsiness.



 While a definite drug interaction with estrogen therapy has not yet been established, caution should be observed if the two drugs are to be given concomitantly. Hepatotoxicity has occurred more often in women over 35 years of age receiving concomitant estrogen therapy.



 Cardiovascular collapse in patients treated simultaneously with verapamil and dantrolene sodium is rare. The combination of therapeutic doses of intravenous dantrolene sodium and verapamil in halothane/alpha-chloralose anesthetized swine has resulted in ventricular fibrillation and cardiovascular collapse in association with marked hyperkalemia. Until the relevance of these findings to humans is established, the combination of dantrolene sodium and calcium channel blockers is not recommended during the management of malignant hyperthermia.



 Administration of Dantrium  may potentiate vecuronium-induced neuromuscular block.
