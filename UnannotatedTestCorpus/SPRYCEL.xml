  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The data described below reflect exposure to SPRYCEL at all doses tested in clinical studies (n=2809), including 324 adult patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML, 2388 adult patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant chronic or advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL, and 97 pediatric patients with chronic phase CML. The median duration of therapy in a total of 2712 adult patients was 19.2 months (range 0 to 93.2 months). In a randomized trial in patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML, the median duration of therapy was approximately 60 months. The median duration of therapy in 1618 adult patients with chronic phase CML was 29 months (range 0 to 92.9 months).



 The median duration of therapy in 1094 adult patients with advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL was 6.2 months (range 0 to 93.2 months).



 In two non-randomized trials in 97 pediatric patients with chronic phase CML (51 patients newly diagnosed and 46 patients resistant or intolerant to previous treatment with imatinib), the median duration of therapy was 51.1 months (range 1.9 to 99.6 months).



 In the overall population of 2712 adult patients, 88% of patients experienced adverse reactions at some time and 19% experienced adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation.



 In the randomized trial in adult patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML, drug was discontinued for adverse reactions in 16% of patients with a minimum of 60 months of follow-up. After a minimum of 60 months of follow-up, the cumulative discontinuation rate was 39%. Among the 1618 patients with chronic phase CML, drug-related adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were reported in 329 (20.3%) patients; among the 1094 patients with advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL, drug-related adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were reported in 191 (17.5%) patients.



 Among the 97 pediatric subjects, drug-related adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were reported in 1 patient (1%).



 Adverse reactions reported in &gt;=10% of adult patients, and other adverse reactions of interest, in a randomized trial in patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML at a median follow-up of approximately 60 months are presented in Table 5.



 Adverse reactions reported in &gt;=10% of adult patients treated at the recommended dose of 100 mg once daily (n=165), and other adverse reactions of interest, in a randomized dose-optimization trial of patients with chronic phase CML resistant or intolerant to prior imatinib therapy at a median follow-up of approximately 84 months are presented in Table 7.



 Adverse reactions reported in &gt;=10% of pediatric patients at a median follow-up of approximately 51.1 months are presented in Table 10.



 Drug-related serious adverse reactions (SARs) were reported for 16.7% of adult patients in the randomized trial of patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML. Serious adverse reactions reported in &gt;=5% of patients included pleural effusion (5%).



 Drug-related SARs were reported for 26.1% of patients treated at the recommended dose of 100 mg once daily in the randomized dose-optimization trial of adult patients with chronic phase CML resistant or intolerant to prior imatinib therapy. Serious adverse reactions reported in &gt;=5% of patients included pleural effusion (10%).



 Drug-related SARs were reported for 14.4% of pediatric patients.



   Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML)

  Adverse reactions (excluding laboratory abnormalities) that were reported in at least 10% of adult patients are shown in Table 5 for newly diagnosed patients with chronic phase CML and Tables 7 and 10 for CML patients with resistance or intolerance to prior imatinib therapy.

           Laboratory Abnormalities
   Myelosuppression was commonly reported in all patient populations. The frequency of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia was higher in patients with advanced phase CML than in chronic phase CML (Tables 11 and 12). Myelosuppression was reported in patients with normal baseline laboratory values as well as in patients with pre-existing laboratory abnormalities.



 In patients who experienced severe myelosuppression, recovery generally occurred following dose interruption or reduction; permanent discontinuation of treatment occurred in 2% of adult patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML and 5% of adult patients with resistance or intolerance to prior imatinib therapy  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  .



 Grade 3 or 4 elevations of transaminases or bilirubin and Grade 3 or 4 hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, and hypophosphatemia were reported in patients with all phases of CML but were reported with an increased frequency in patients with myeloid or lymphoid blast phase CML. Elevations in transaminases or bilirubin were usually managed with dose reduction or interruption. Patients developing Grade 3 or 4 hypocalcemia during SPRYCEL therapy often had recovery with oral calcium supplementation.



 Laboratory abnormalities reported in adult patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML are shown in Table 11. There were no discontinuations of SPRYCEL therapy in this patient population due to biochemical laboratory parameters.

           Among adult patients with chronic phase CML with resistance or intolerance to prior imatinib therapy, cumulative Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias were similar at 2 and 5 years including: neutropenia (36% vs 36%), thrombocytopenia (23% vs 24%), and anemia (13% vs 13%).
 

 In the pediatric studies, the rates of laboratory abnormalities were consistent with the known profile for laboratory parameters in adults.



   Philadelphia Chromosome-Positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (Ph+ ALL) in Adults

  A total of 135 patients with Ph+ ALL were treated with SPRYCEL in clinical studies. The median duration of treatment was 3 months (range 0.03-31 months). The safety profile of patients with Ph+ ALL was similar to those with lymphoid blast phase CML. The most frequently reported adverse reactions included fluid retention events, such as pleural effusion (24%) and superficial edema (19%), and gastrointestinal disorders, such as diarrhea (31%), nausea (24%), and vomiting (16%). Hemorrhage (19%), pyrexia (17%), rash (16%), and dyspnea (16%) were also frequently reported.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *     Myelosuppression and Bleeding Events: Severe thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia may occur. Use caution if used concomitantly with medications that inhibit platelet function or anticoagulants. Monitor complete blood counts regularly. Transfuse and interrupt SPRYCEL when indicated.  (2.5  ,  5.1  ,  5.2  ,  6.1)   
 *     Fluid Retention: Fluid retention, sometimes severe, including pleural effusions. Manage with supportive care measures and/or dose modification.  (2.5  ,  5.3  ,  6.1)   
 *     Cardiac Dysfunction: Monitor patients for signs or symptoms and treat appropriately.  (5.4  ,  6.1)   
 *     Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH): SPRYCEL may increase the risk of developing PAH which may be reversible on discontinuation. Consider baseline risk and evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of PAH during treatment. Stop SPRYCEL if PAH is confirmed.  (5.5)   
 *     QT Prolongation: Use SPRYCEL with caution in patients who have or may develop prolongation of the QT interval.  (5.6)   
 *     Severe Dermatologic Reactions: Individual cases of severe mucocutaneous dermatologic reactions have been reported.  (5.7  ,  6.3)   
 *     Tumor Lysis Syndrome: Tumor lysis syndrome has been reported. Maintain adequate hydration and correct uric acid levels prior to initiating therapy with SPRYCEL.  (5.8)   
 *     Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise of potential risk to fetus and avoid pregnancy.  (5.9  ,  8.1  ,  8.3)   
 *     Effects on Growth and Development in Pediatric Patients: epiphyses delayed fusion, osteopenia, growth retardation, and gynecomastia have been reported. Monitor bone growth and development in pediatric patients.  (5.10  ,  6.3)   
    
 

   5.1 Myelosuppression



  Treatment with SPRYCEL is associated with severe (NCI CTCAE Grade 3 or 4) thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia, which occur earlier and more frequently in patients with advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL than in patients with chronic phase CML.



 In patients with chronic phase CML, perform complete blood counts (CBCs) every 2 weeks for 12 weeks, then every 3 months thereafter, or as clinically indicated. In patients with advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL, perform CBCs weekly for the first 2 months and then monthly thereafter, or as clinically indicated.



 Myelosuppression is generally reversible and usually managed by withholding SPRYCEL temporarily and/or dose reduction [see     Dosage and Administration (2.5)     and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



    5.2 Bleeding-Related Events



  SPRYCEL can cause serious and fatal bleeding. In all CML or Ph+ ALL clinical studies, Grade &gt;=3 central nervous system (CNS) hemorrhages, including fatalities, occurred in &lt;1% of patients receiving SPRYCEL. The incidence of Grade 3/4 hemorrhage, occurred in 5.8% of adult patients and generally required treatment interruptions and transfusions. The incidence of Grade 5 hemorrhage occurred in 0.4% of adult patients. The most frequent site of hemorrhage was gastrointestinal. Most bleeding events in clinical studies were associated with severe thrombocytopenia. In addition to causing thrombocytopenia in human subjects, dasatinib caused platelet dysfunction in vitro  .



 Concomitant medications that inhibit platelet function or anticoagulants may increase the risk of hemorrhage.



    5.3 Fluid Retention



  SPRYCEL may cause fluid retention. After 5 years of follow-up in the adult randomized newly diagnosed chronic phase CML study (n=258), Grade 3 or 4 fluid retention was reported in 5% of patients, including 3% of patients with Grade 3 or 4 pleural effusion. In adult patients with newly diagnosed or imatinib-resistant or -intolerant chronic phase CML, Grade 3 or 4 fluid retention occurred in 6% of patients treated with SPRYCEL at the recommended dose (n=548). In adult patients with advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL treated with SPRYCEL at the recommended dose (n=304), Grade 3 or 4 fluid retention was reported in 8% of patients, including Grade 3 or 4 pleural effusion reported in 7% of patients. In pediatric patients with chronic phase CML, cases of Grade 1 or 2 fluid retention were reported in 10.3% of patients.



 Evaluate patients who develop symptoms of pleural effusion or other fluid retention, such as new or worsened dyspnea on exertion or at rest, pleuritic chest pain, or dry cough, promptly with a chest x-ray or additional diagnostic imaging as appropriate. Fluid retention events were typically managed by supportive care measures that may include diuretics or short courses of steroids. Severe pleural effusion may require thoracentesis and oxygen therapy. Consider dose reduction or treatment interruption [see     Dosage and Administration (2.5)     and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



    5.4 Cardiovascular Events



  SPRYCEL can cause cardiac dysfunction. After 5 years of follow-up in the randomized newly diagnosed chronic phase CML trial in adults (n=258), the following cardiac adverse reactions occurred: cardiac ischemic events (3.9% dasatinib vs 1.6% imatinib), cardiac-related fluid retention (8.5% dasatinib vs 3.9% imatinib), and conduction system abnormalities, most commonly arrhythmia and palpitations (7.0% dasatinib vs 5.0% imatinib). Two cases (0.8%) of peripheral arterial occlusive disease occurred with imatinib and 2 (0.8%) transient ischemic attacks occurred with dasatinib. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms consistent with cardiac dysfunction and treat appropriately.



    5.5 Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension



  SPRYCEL may increase the risk of developing pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in adult and pediatric patients which may occur any time after initiation, including after more than 1 year of treatment. Manifestations include dyspnea, fatigue, hypoxia, and fluid retention. PAH may be reversible on discontinuation of SPRYCEL. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of underlying cardiopulmonary disease prior to initiating SPRYCEL and during treatment. If PAH is confirmed, SPRYCEL should be permanently discontinued.



    5.6 QT Prolongation



  SPRYCEL may increase the risk of prolongation of QTc in patients including those with hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, patients with congenital long QT syndrome, patients taking antiarrhythmic medicines or other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation, and cumulative high-dose anthracycline therapy. Correct hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia prior to and during SPRYCEL administration.



    5.7 Severe Dermatologic Reactions



  Cases of severe mucocutaneous dermatologic reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and erythema multiforme, have been reported in patients treated with SPRYCEL. Discontinue permanently in patients who experience a severe mucocutaneous reaction during treatment if no other etiology can be identified.



    5.8 Tumor Lysis Syndrome



  Tumor lysis syndrome has been reported in patients with resistance to prior imatinib therapy, primarily in advanced phase disease. Due to potential for tumor lysis syndrome, maintain adequate hydration, correct uric acid levels prior to initiating therapy with SPRYCEL, and monitor electrolyte levels. Patients with advanced stage disease and/or high tumor burden may be at increased risk and should be monitored more frequently [see     Adverse Reactions (6.2)     ]  .



    5.9 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  Based on limited human data, SPRYCEL can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Adverse pharmacologic effects of SPRYCEL including hydrops fetalis, fetal leukopenia, and fetal thrombocytopenia have been reported with maternal exposure to SPRYCEL. Advise females of reproductive potential to avoid pregnancy, which may include the use of effective contraception, during treatment with SPRYCEL and for 30 days after the final dose [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1  ,  8.3)  ]  .



    5.10 Effects on Growth and Development in Pediatric Patients



   In pediatric trials of SPRYCEL in chronic phase CML after at least 2 years of treatment, adverse reactions associated with bone growth and development were reported in 5 (5.2%) patients, one of which was severe in intensity (Growth Retardation Grade 3). These 5 cases included cases of epiphyses delayed fusion, osteopenia, growth retardation, and gynecomastia [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  and  Use in Specific Populations (8.4)  ]  . Of these 5 cases, 1 case of osteopenia and 1 case of gynecomastia resolved during treatment.
