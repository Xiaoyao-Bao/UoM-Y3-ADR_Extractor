   To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Kyowa Kirin, Inc. at 1-800-SANCUSO (1-800-726-2876) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.  



 

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 The safety of Sancuso was evaluated in a total of 404 patients undergoing chemotherapy who participated in two double-blind, comparator studies with patch treatment durations of up to 7 days. The control groups included a total of 406 patients who received a daily dose of 2 mg oral granisetron, for 1 to 5 days.



 Adverse reactions occurred in 8.7% (35/404) of patients receiving Sancuso and 7.1% (29/406) of patients receiving oral granisetron. The most common adverse reaction was constipation that occurred in 5.4% of patients in the Sancuso group and 3.0% of patients in the oral granisetron group.



 Table 1 lists the adverse reactions that occurred in at least 3% of patients treated with Sancuso or oral granisetron.

         5-HT3receptor antagonists, such as granisetron, may be associated with arrhythmias or ECG abnormalities. Three ECGs were performed on 588 patients in a randomized, parallel group, double-blind, double-dummy study: at baseline before treatment, the first day of chemotherapy, and 5 to 7 days after starting chemotherapy. QTcF prolongation greater than 450 milliseconds was seen in a total of 11 (1.9%) patients after receiving granisetron, 8 (2.7%) on oral granisetron, and 3 (1.1%) on the patch. No new QTcF prolongation greater than 480 milliseconds was observed in any patient in this study. No arrhythmias were detected in this study.
 

 Adverse reactions reported in clinical trials with other formulations of granisetron include the following:



   Gastrointestinal:  abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, elevation of ALT and AST levels, nausea and vomiting



   Cardiovascular:  hypertension, hypotension, angina pectoris, atrial fibrillation and syncope have been observed rarely



   Central Nervous System:  dizziness, insomnia, headache, anxiety, somnolence and asthenia



   Hypersensitivity:  rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g. anaphylaxis, shortness of breath, hypotension, urticaria) have been reported



   Other:  fever; events often associated with chemotherapy have also been reported: leucopenia, decreased appetite, anemia, alopecia, thrombocytopenia.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Sancuso. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions:  Application site reactions (pain, pruritus, erythema, rash, irritation, vesicles, burn, discoloration, urticaria); patch non-adhesion.



   Cardiac Disorders  : bradycardia, chest pain, palpitations, sick sinus syndrome

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Granisetron may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention caused by the underlying condition. (  5.1  ) 
 *  Serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. (  5.2  ) 
 *  Mild application site reactions have occurred; remove patch if severe reactions or a generalized skin reaction occur. (  5.3  ) 
 *  Avoid exposing the granisetron patch and surrounding area to direct external heat sources, such as heating pads (  5.4  ). 
 *  Avoid direct exposure of application site to natural or artificial sunlight by covering with clothing while wearing the patch and for 10 days after removing it. (  5.5  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Gastrointestinal



  The use of granisetron in patients may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention caused by the underlying condition.



    5.2 Serotonin Syndrome



  The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of another 5-HT3receptor antagonist alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center.



 Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of Sancuso and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue Sancuso and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if Sancuso is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs. [see  Drug Interactions (7)  ,  Patient Counseling Information (17.4)  ].  



    5.3 Skin Reactions



  In clinical trials with Sancuso, application site reactions were reported that were generally mild in intensity and did not lead to discontinuation of use. The incidence of reactions was comparable with placebo.



 If severe reactions, or a generalized skin reaction occur (e.g., allergic rash, including erythematous, macular, papular rash or pruritus), the patch must be removed.



    5.4 External Heat Sources



  A heat pad should not be applied over or in vicinity of Sancuso patch. Patients should avoid prolonged exposure to heat as plasma concentration continues increasing during the period of heat exposure [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  .



    5.5 Exposure to Sunlight



  Granisetron may be affected by direct natural or artificial sunlight. Patients must be advised to cover the patch application site, e.g. with clothing, if there is a risk of exposure to sunlight throughout the period of wear and for 10 days following its removal because of a potential skin reaction [see  Nonclinical Toxicology (13.3)  ]  .
