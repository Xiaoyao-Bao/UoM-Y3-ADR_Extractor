  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     Ertugliflozin and Metformin Hydrochloride  



 The incidence and type of adverse reactions in the two 26-week, placebo-controlled trials of ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg added to metformin, representing a majority of data from the three 26-week, placebo-controlled trials, were similar to the adverse reactions described in Table 1.



     Ertugliflozin  



     Pool of Placebo-Controlled Trials  



 The data in Table 1 are derived from a pool of three 26-week, placebo-controlled trials. Ertugliflozin was used as monotherapy in one trial and as add-on therapy in two trials  [see  Clinical Studies (14)  ]  . These data reflect exposure of 1,029 patients to ertugliflozin with a mean exposure duration of approximately 25 weeks. Patients received ertugliflozin 5 mg (N=519), ertugliflozin 15 mg (N=510), or placebo (N=515) once daily. The mean age of the population was 57 years and 2% were older than 75 years of age. Fifty-three percent (53%) of the population was male and 73% were Caucasian, 15% were Asian, and 7% were Black or African American. At baseline the population had diabetes for an average of 7.5 years, had a mean HbA1c of 8.1%, and 19.4% had established microvascular complications of diabetes. Baseline renal function (mean eGFR 88.9 mL/min/1.73 m  2  ) was normal or mildly impaired in 97% of patients and moderately impaired in 3% of patients.



 Table 1 shows common adverse reactions associated with the use of ertugliflozin. These adverse reactions were not present at baseline, occurred more commonly on ertugliflozin than on placebo, and occurred in at least 2% of patients treated with either ertugliflozin 5 mg or ertugliflozin 15 mg.

              Volume Depletion  
 

 Ertugliflozin causes an osmotic diuresis, which may lead to intravascular volume contraction and adverse reactions related to volume depletion, particularly in patients with impaired renal function (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m  2  ). In patients with moderate renal impairment, adverse reactions related to volume depletion (e.g., dehydration, dizziness postural, presyncope, syncope, hypotension, and orthostatic hypotension) were reported in 0%, 4.4%, and 1.9% of patients treated with placebo, ertugliflozin 5 mg, and ertugliflozin 15 mg, respectively. Ertugliflozin may also increase the risk of hypotension in other patients at risk for volume contraction  [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.5  ,  8.6)  ]  .



     Ketoacidosis  



 Across the clinical program, ketoacidosis was identified in 3 of 3,409 (0.1%) ertugliflozin-treated patients and 0.0% of comparator-treated patients  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  .



     Impairment in Renal Function  



 Treatment with ertugliflozin was associated with increases in serum creatinine and decreases in eGFR (see  Table 2  ). Patients with moderate renal impairment at baseline had larger mean changes. In a study in patients with moderate renal impairment, these abnormal laboratory findings were observed to reverse after treatment discontinuation  [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.5  ,  8.6)  ]  .

           Renal-related adverse reactions (e.g., acute kidney injury, renal impairment, acute prerenal failure) may occur in patients treated with ertugliflozin, particularly in patients with moderate renal impairment where the incidence of renal-related adverse reactions was 0.6%, 2.5%, and 1.3% in patients treated with placebo, ertugliflozin 5 mg, and ertugliflozin 15 mg, respectively.
 

     Lower Limb Amputation  



 Across seven Phase 3 clinical trials in which ertugliflozin was studied as monotherapy and in combination with other antihyperglycemic agents, non-traumatic lower limb amputations occurred in 1 of 1,450 (0.1%) in the non-ertugliflozin group, 3 of 1,716 (0.2%) in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group, and 8 of 1,693 (0.5%) in the ertugliflozin 15 mg group.



     Hypoglycemia  



 The incidence of hypoglycemia by study is shown in Table 3.

              Genital Mycotic Infections  
 

 In the pool of three placebo-controlled clinical trials, the incidence of female genital mycotic infections (e.g., genital candidiasis, genital infection fungal, vaginal infection, vulvitis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, vulvovaginal mycotic infection, vulvovaginitis) occurred in 3%, 9.1%, and 12.2%, of females treated with placebo, ertugliflozin 5 mg, and ertugliflozin 15 mg, respectively (see  Table 1  ). In females, discontinuation due to genital mycotic infections occurred in 0% and 0.6% of patients treated with placebo and ertugliflozin, respectively.



 In the same pool, male genital mycotic infections (e.g., balanitis candida, balanoposthitis, genital infection, genital infection fungal) occurred in 0.4%, 3.7%, and 4.2% of males treated with placebo, ertugliflozin 5 mg, and ertugliflozin 15 mg, respectively. Male genital mycotic infections occurred more commonly in uncircumcised males. In males, discontinuations due to genital mycotic infections occurred in 0% and 0.2% of patients treated with placebo and ertugliflozin, respectively. Phimosis was reported in 8 of 1,729 (0.5%) male ertugliflozin-treated patients, of which four required circumcision.



     Metformin  



 The most common (5% or greater incidence) established adverse reactions due to initiation of metformin therapy are diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, flatulence, abdominal discomfort, indigestion, asthenia, and headache.



 Long-term treatment with metformin has been associated with a decrease in vitamin B12absorption, which may very rarely result in clinically significant vitamin B12deficiency (e.g., megaloblastic anemia)  .  



     Laboratory Tests  



     Ertugliflozin  



     Increases in Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C)  



 In the pool of three placebo-controlled trials, dose-related increases in LDL-C were observed in patients treated with ertugliflozin. Mean percent changes from baseline to Week 26 in LDL-C relative to placebo were 2.6% and 5.4% with ertugliflozin 5 mg and ertugliflozin 15 mg, respectively. The range of mean baseline LDL-C was 96.6 to 97.7 mg/dL across treatment groups  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.11)  ]  .



     Increases in Hemoglobin  



 In the pool of three placebo-controlled trials, mean changes (percent changes) from baseline to Week 26 in hemoglobin were -0.21 g/dL (-1.4%) with placebo, 0.46 g/dL (3.5%) with ertugliflozin 5 mg, and 0.48 g/dL (3.5%) with ertugliflozin 15 mg. The range of mean baseline hemoglobin was 13.90 to 14.00 g/dL across treatment groups. At the end of treatment, 0.0%, 0.2%, and 0.4% of patients treated with placebo, ertugliflozin 5 mg, and ertugliflozin 15 mg, respectively, had a hemoglobin increase greater than 2 g/dL and above the upper limit of normal.



     Increases in Serum Phosphate  



 In the pool of three placebo-controlled trials, mean changes (percent changes) from baseline in serum phosphate were 0.04 mg/dL (1.9%) with placebo, 0.21 mg/dL (6.8%) with ertugliflozin 5 mg, and 0.26 mg/dL (8.5%) with ertugliflozin 15 mg. The range of mean baseline serum phosphate was 3.53 to 3.54 mg/dL across treatment groups. In a clinical trial of patients with moderate renal impairment, mean changes (mean percent changes) from baseline at Week 26 in serum phosphate were -0.01 mg/dL (0.8%) with placebo, 0.29 mg/dL (9.7%) with ertugliflozin 5 mg, and 0.24 mg/dL (7.8%) with ertugliflozin 15 mg.



     Metformin  



 In controlled clinical trials of metformin of 29 weeks duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12levels, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decreases, possibly due to interference with B12absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex is, however, very rarely associated with anemia and appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B12supplementation  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.10)  ]  .



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  Additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 *  Cases of necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier's gangrene) have been seen with SGLT2 inhibitors [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.8)  ]

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: LACTIC ACIDOSIS

    WARNING: LACTIC ACIDOSIS  

    Post-marketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis have resulted in death, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias. The onset of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is often subtle, accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (&gt;5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio, and metformin plasma levels generally &gt;5 mcg/mL   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  .  



   Risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (e.g., carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate), age 65 years old or greater, having a radiological study with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states (e.g., acute congestive heart failure), excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment.  



   Steps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis in these high risk groups are provided in the Full Prescribing Information   [see   Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ,   Contraindications (4)  ,   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ,   Drug Interactions (7)  , and   Use in Specific Populations (8.6  ,   8.7  )]  .  



   If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, immediately discontinue SEGLUROMET and institute general supportive measures in a hospital setting. Prompt hemodialysis is recommended   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  .

   5.1 Lactic Acidosis



  There have been post-marketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (&gt;5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate:pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally &gt;5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.



 If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of SEGLUROMET. In SEGLUROMET-treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable, with a clearance of up to 170 mL/minute under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.



 Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and if these symptoms occur instruct them to discontinue SEGLUROMET and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.



 For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:



    Renal Impairment:  The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.4)  and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  .



 *  Before initiating SEGLUROMET, obtain an eGFR. 
 *  SEGLUROMET is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/minute/1.73 m  2  . 
 *  Initiation of SEGLUROMET is not recommended in patients with an eGFR of 30 mL/minute/1.73 m  2  to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m  2  . 
 *  Continued use of SEGLUROMET is not recommended when eGFR is persistently between 30 and less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m  2  . 
 *  Renal function should be evaluated prior to initiating SEGLUROMET and periodically thereafter. In patients at increased risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. 
       Drug Interactions:  The concomitant use of SEGLUROMET with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance or increase metformin accumulation (e.g., cationic drugs) [see  Drug Interactions (7)  ]  . Therefore, consider more frequent monitoring of patients.
 

    Age 65 or Greater:  The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.5)  ]  .



    Radiological Studies with Contrast:  Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop SEGLUROMET at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m  2  ; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart SEGLUROMET if renal function is stable.



    Surgery and Other Procedures:  Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension and renal impairment. SEGLUROMET should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.



    Hypoxic States:  Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause pre-renal azotemia. When such events occur, discontinue SEGLUROMET.



    Excessive Alcohol Intake:  Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism and this may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving SEGLUROMET.



    Hepatic Impairment:  Patients with hepatic impairment have developed metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of SEGLUROMET in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.



    5.2 Hypotension



  Ertugliflozin, a component of SEGLUROMET, causes intravascular volume contraction. Therefore, symptomatic hypotension may occur after initiating SEGLUROMET [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  particularly in patients with impaired renal function (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m  2  ) [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.6)  ]  , elderly patients (&gt;=65 years), in patients with low systolic blood pressure, and in patients on diuretics. Before initiating SEGLUROMET, volume status should be assessed and corrected if indicated. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension after initiating therapy.



    5.3 Ketoacidosis



  Reports of ketoacidosis, a serious life-threatening condition requiring urgent hospitalization, have been identified in clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and cases have been reported in ertugliflozin-treated patients in clinical trials. Across the clinical program, ketoacidosis was identified in 3 of 3,409 (0.1%) of ertugliflozin-treated patients and 0% of comparator-treated patients. Fatal cases of ketoacidosis have been reported in patients taking medicines containing SGLT2 inhibitors. SEGLUROMET is not indicated for the treatment of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus [see  Indications and Usage (1)  ]  .



 Patients treated with SEGLUROMET who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis should be assessed for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels, as ketoacidosis associated with SEGLUROMET may be present even if blood glucose levels are less than 250 mg/dL. If ketoacidosis is suspected, SEGLUROMET should be discontinued, patient should be evaluated, and prompt treatment should be instituted. Treatment of ketoacidosis may require insulin, fluid, and carbohydrate replacement.



 In many of the reported cases, and particularly in patients with type 1 diabetes, the presence of ketoacidosis was not immediately recognized and institution of treatment was delayed because presenting blood glucose levels were below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (often less than 250 mg/dL). Signs and symptoms at presentation were consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis and included nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. In some but not all cases, factors predisposing to ketoacidosis such as insulin dose reduction, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake due to illness or surgery, pancreatic disorders suggesting insulin deficiency (e.g., type 1 diabetes, history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery), and alcohol abuse were identified.



 Before initiating SEGLUROMET, consider factors in the patient history that may predispose to ketoacidosis, including pancreatic insulin deficiency from any cause, caloric restriction, and alcohol abuse. In patients treated with SEGLUROMET consider monitoring for ketoacidosis and temporarily discontinuing SEGLUROMET in clinical situations known to predispose to ketoacidosis (e.g., prolonged fasting due to acute illness or surgery).



    5.4 Acute Kidney Injury and Impairment in Renal Function



  SEGLUROMET causes intravascular volume contraction and can cause renal impairment [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . There have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury some requiring hospitalization and dialysis in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors.



 Before initiating SEGLUROMET, consider factors that may predispose patients to acute kidney injury including hypovolemia, chronic renal insufficiency, congestive heart failure and concomitant medications (diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, NSAIDs). Consider temporarily discontinuing SEGLUROMET in any setting of reduced oral intake (such as acute illness or fasting) or fluid losses (such as gastrointestinal illness or excessive heat exposure); monitor patients for signs and symptoms of acute kidney injury. If acute kidney injury occurs, discontinue SEGLUROMET promptly and institute treatment.



 Ertugliflozin, a component of SEGLUROMET, increases serum creatinine and decreases eGFR. Patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m  2  ) may be more susceptible to these changes. Renal function abnormalities can occur after initiating SEGLUROMET [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Renal function should be evaluated prior to initiating SEGLUROMET and periodically thereafter. Use of SEGLUROMET is not recommended when eGFR is persistently between 30 mL/min/1.73 m  2  and less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m  2  and is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m  2   [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ,  Contraindications (4)  ,  Use in Specific Populations (8.6)  ]  .



    5.5 Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis



  There have been postmarketing reports of serious urinary tract infections, including urosepsis and pyelonephritis, requiring hospitalization in patients receiving medicines containing SGLT2 inhibitors. Cases of pyelonephritis also have been reported in ertugliflozin-treated patients in clinical trials. Treatment with medicines containing SGLT2 inhibitors increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



    5.6 Lower Limb Amputation



  An increased risk for lower limb amputation (primarily of the toe) has been observed in clinical studies with another SGLT2 inhibitor. Across seven Phase 3 clinical trials in the ertugliflozin development program, non-traumatic lower limb amputations were reported in 1 (0.1%) patient in the comparator group, 3 (0.2%) patients in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group, and 8 (0.5%) patients in the ertugliflozin 15 mg group. A causal association between ertugliflozin and lower limb amputation has not been definitively established.



 Before initiating SEGLUROMET, consider factors in the patient history that may predispose them to the need for amputations, such as a history of prior amputation, peripheral vascular disease, neuropathy and diabetic foot ulcers. Counsel patients about the importance of routine preventative foot care. Monitor patients receiving SEGLUROMET for signs and symptoms of infection (including osteomyelitis), new pain or tenderness, sores or ulcers involving the lower limbs, and discontinue SEGLUROMET if these complications occur.



    5.7 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues



   Ertugliflozin  



 Insulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Ertugliflozin, a component of SEGLUROMET, may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with SEGLUROMET.



    Metformin  



 Hypoglycemia does not occur in patients receiving metformin, a component of SEGLUROMET, alone under usual circumstances of use, but could occur when caloric intake is deficient, when strenuous exercise is not compensated by caloric supplementation, or during concomitant use with other glucose-lowering agents (such as sulfonylureas and insulin) or ethanol. Elderly, debilitated, or malnourished patients, and those with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency or alcohol intoxication are particularly susceptible to hypoglycemic effects. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly, and in people who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking drugs.



    5.8 Necrotizing Fasciitis of the Perineum (Fournier's Gangrene)



   Reports of necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier's gangrene), a rare but serious and life-threatening necrotizing infection requiring urgent surgical intervention, have been identified in postmarketing surveillance in patients with diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors. Cases have been reported in females and males. Serious outcomes have included hospitalization, multiple surgeries, and death.  



  Patients treated with SEGLUROMET presenting with pain or tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, along with fever or malaise, should be assessed for necrotizing fasciitis. If suspected, start treatment immediately with broad-spectrum antibiotics and, if necessary, surgical debridement. Discontinue SEGLUROMET, closely monitor blood glucose levels, and provide appropriate alternative therapy for glycemic control.  



    5.9 Genital Mycotic Infections



  Ertugliflozin, a component of SEGLUROMET, increases the risk of genital mycotic infections. Patients who have a history of genital mycotic infections or who are uncircumcised are more likely to develop genital mycotic infections [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Monitor and treat appropriately.



    5.10 Vitamin B12Levels



  In controlled clinical trials of metformin, a component of SEGLUROMET, of 29 weeks duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12levels, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, is, however, very rarely associated with anemia and appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B12supplementation. Measurement of hematologic parameters on an annual basis is advised in patients on SEGLUROMET and any apparent abnormalities should be appropriately investigated and managed.



 Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12levels. In these patients, routine serum vitamin B12measurements at two- to three-year intervals may be useful.



    5.11 Increases in Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C)



  Dose-related increases in LDL-C can occur with ertugliflozin, a component of SEGLUROMET [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Monitor and treat as appropriate.



    5.12 Macrovascular Outcomes



  There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with SEGLUROMET.
