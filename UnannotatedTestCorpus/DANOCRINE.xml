  The following events have been reported in association with the use of DANOCRINE:



 Androgen like effects include weight gain, acne and seborrhea. Mild hirsutism, edema, hair loss, voice change, which may take the form of hoarseness, sore throat or of instability or deepening of pitch, may occur and may persist after cessation of therapy. Hypertrophy of the clitoris is rare.



 Other possible endocrine effects are menstrual disturbances including spotting, alteration of the timing of the cycle and amenorrhea. Although cyclical bleeding and ovulation usually return within 60-90 days after discontinuation of therapy with DANOCRINE, persistent amenorrhea has occasionally been reported.



 Flushing, sweating, vaginal dryness and irritation and reduction in breast size, may reflect lowering of estrogen. Nervousness and emotional lability have been reported. In the male a modest reduction in spermatogenesis may be evident during treatment. Abnormalities in semen volume, viscosity, sperm count, and motility may occur in patients receiving long-term therapy.



 Hepatic dysfunction, as evidenced by reversible elevated serum enzymes and/or jaundice, has been reported in patients receiving a daily dosage of DANOCRINE of 400 mg or more. It is recommended that patients receiving DANOCRINE be monitored for hepatic dysfunction by laboratory tests and clinical observation. Serious hepatic toxicity including cholestatic jaundice, peliosis hepatis, hepatic adenoma, hepatocellular injury, hepatocellular jaundice and hepatic failure have been reported. (See  WARNINGS  and  PRECAUTIONS  .)



 Abnormalities in laboratory tests may occur during therapy with DANOCRINE including CPK, glucose tolerance, glucagon, thyroid binding globulin, sex hormone binding globulin, other plasma proteins, lipids and lipoproteins.



 The following reactions have been reported, a causal relationship to the administration of DANOCRINE has neither been confirmed nor refuted;  allergic  : urticaria, pruritus and rarely, nasal congestion;  CNS effects  : headache, nervousness and emotional lability, dizziness and fainting, depression, fatigue, sleep disorders, tremor, paresthesias, weakness, visual disturbances, and rarely, benign intracranial hypertension, anxiety, changes in appetite, chills, and rarely convulsions, Guillain-Barre syndrome;  gastrointestinal  : gastroenteritis, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and rarely, pancreatitis and splenic peliosis;  musculoskeletal  : muscle cramps or spasms, or pains, joint pain, joint lockup, joint swelling, pain in back, neck, or extremities, and rarely, carpal tunnel syndrome which may be secondary to fluid retention;  genitourinary  : hematuria, prolonged posttherapy amenorrhea;  hematologic  : an increase in red cell and platelet count. Reversible erythrocytosis, leukocytosis or polycythemia may be provoked. Eosinophilia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia have also been noted.  Skin  : rashes (maculopapular, vesicular, papular, purpuric, petechial), and rarely, sun sensitivity, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and erythema multiforme;  other  : increased insulin requirements in diabetic patients, change in libido, myocardial infarction, palpitation, tachycardia, elevation in blood pressure, interstitial pneumonitis, and rarely, cataracts, bleeding gums, fever, pelvic pain, nipple discharge. Malignant liver tumors have been reported in rare instances, after long-term use.

  Because DANOCRINE may cause some degree of fluid retention, conditions that might be influenced by this factor, such as epilepsy, migraine, or cardiac or renal dysfunction, polycythemia and hypertension require careful observation. Use with caution in patients with diabetes mellitus.



 Since hepatic dysfunction manifested by modest increases in serum transaminases levels has been reported in patients treated with DANOCRINE, periodic liver function tests should be performed (see  WARNINGS  and  ADVERSE REACTIONS  ).



 Administration of danazol has been reported to cause exacerbation of the manifestations of acute intermittent porphyria. (See  CONTRAINDICATIONS  .)



 Laboratory monitoring of the hematologic state should be considered.



    Drug Interactions



  Prolongation of prothrombin time occurs in patients stabilized on warfarin. Therapy with danazol may cause an increase in carbamazepine levels in patients taking both drugs. Danazol can cause insulin resistance. Caution should be exercised when used with antidiabetic drugs.



 Danazol may raise the plasma levels of cyclosporin and tacrolimus, leading to an increase of the renal toxicity of these drugs. Monitoring of systemic concentrations of these drugs and appropriate dose adjustments may be needed when used concomitantly with danazol.



 Danazol can increase the calcemic response to synthetic vitamin D analogs in primary hypoparathyroidism.



 The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased by concomitant administration of danazol with statins such as simvastatin, atorvastatin and lovastatin. Caution should be exercised if used concomitantly. Consult the product labeling for statin drugs for specific information on dose restrictions in presence of danazol.



    Laboratory Tests



  Danazol treatment may interfere with laboratory determinations of testosterone, androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone. Other metabolic events include a reduction in thyroid binding globulin and T4 with increased uptake of T3, but without disturbance of thyroid stimulating hormone or of free thyroxin index.



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility



  Current data are insufficient to assess the carcinogenicity of danazol.



    Pregnancy, Teratogenic Effects



   



  (See  CONTRAINDICATIONS  .) Pregnancy Category X. DANOCRINE administered orally to pregnant rats from the 6th through the 15  th  day of gestation at doses up to 250 mg/kg/day (7-15 times the human dose) did not result in drug-induced embryotoxicity or teratogenicity, nor difference in litter size, viability or weight of offspring compared to controls. In rabbits, the administration of DANOCRINE on days 6-18 of gestation at doses of 60 mg/kg/day and above (2-4 times the human dose) resulted in inhibition of fetal development.



    Nursing Mothers



  (See  CONTRAINDICATIONS  .)



    Pediatric Use



  Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.



    Geriatric Use



  Clinical studies of DANOCRINE did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine the safety and effectiveness of Danocrine in elderly patients.
