  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



     Local Adverse Reactions:  Local adverse reactions derived from 1861 patients in clinical studies of CAVERJECT, including an 18-month, open-label study, are shown in Table 2.

 In these studies, no local adverse reactions were reported in the 294 patients who received placebo, except for penile pain (2%).



   Penile Pain:  In the majority of the cases, penile pain was rated mild or moderate in intensity. Three percent of patients discontinued treatment because of penile pain



   Prolonged Erection/Priapism:  Prolonged erection was defined as an erection that lasted for 4 to 6 hours; priapism was defined as an erection that lasted 6 hours or longer. In clinical studies the frequency of prolonged erection after intracavernosal administration of CAVERJECT was 4%, while the frequency of priapism was 0.4%  [  see    Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  .



   Penile Hematoma/Ecchymosis:  In clinical studies the frequency of penile hematoma and ecchymosis was 3% and 2%, respectively.



     Systemic Adverse Reactions    :  Systemic adverse reactions reported by &gt;= 1% of subjects in clinical studies of CAVERJECT included: dizziness (1%).



 The following systemic adverse reactions were reported in &lt; 1% of patients: testicular pain, scrotal edema, hematuria, pelvic pain, hypotension, vasodilation, vasovagal reaction, diaphoresis, rash, and non-application site pruritus. Three patients (0.2%) discontinued due to symptomatic hypotension.



 No systemic adverse reactions were reported in the 294 patients who received placebo.



 In addition to the adverse reactions observed for CAVERJECT, the following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical studies of CAVERJECT IMPULSE:



 CAVERJECT IMPULSE was evaluated in 87 patients in an open-label crossover study of 6 weeks treatment duration that compared the formulation of alprostadil for injection contained in CAVERJECT IMPULSE with the formulation contained in CAVERJECT. Doses used in this study ranged from 2.5 mcg to 20 mcg. Adverse reactions reported for the CAVERJECT IMPULSE formulation included: penis disorder (4.6%), prolonged erection (1.1%), injection site erythema (1.1%), rash (1.1%), dizziness (1.1%), and hematospermia (1.1%). Penis disorder included penile pain, post-injection pain, and pain with erection.



 CAVERJECT IMPULSE was also evaluated in 63 patients in a single-dose, double-blind, crossover study that compared CAVERJECT IMPULSE with CAVERJECT. Doses used in this study ranged from 2.5 mcg to 20 mcg. Adverse reactions reported for the CAVERJECT IMPULSE formulation included: penile pain (1.6%) and pruritis (1.6%).



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reaction has been identified during post-approval use of CAVERJECT:



 There have been reports of needle breakage during administration of CAVERJECT. In some instances surgical removal of the needle was required.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *   Prolonged erection and priapism have occurred in patients receiving CAVERJECT. To minimize the chances of this occurring, titrate CAVERJECT slowly to the lowest effective dose (  2.1  ). Advise patients to seek immediate medical assistance for an erection that persists longer than 4 hours (  5.1  ). 
 *   Penile fibrosis has occurred in patients receiving CAVERJECT. Follow patients regularly to detect signs of penile fibrosis. Discontinue in patients who develop penile angulation or cavernosal fibrosis (  5.2  ). 
 *   Hypotension: Injections of CAVERJECT can lead to increased peripheral blood levels of alprostadil, especially in patients with significant corpora cavernosa venous leakage. Avoid use in patients with known cavernosal venous leakage (  5.3  ). 
 *   Injection site bleeding may occur in patients taking anticoagulants, such as warfarin or heparin. Compress the site of injection with an alcohol swab or sterile gauze for 5 minutes (  5.4  ). 
 *   Cardiovascular risk related to underlying medical conditions: Underlying treatable medical causes of erectile dysfunction should be diagnosed and treated prior to initiation of therapy (  5.5  ). 
 *   Risks of use in combination with other vasoactive medications injected intracavernosally: Safety and efficacy of combinations of CAVERJECT and other vasoactive agents have not been systematically studied. Use of such combinations is not recommended (  5.6  ). 
 *   Needle breakage: CAVERJECT uses a superfine needle and cases of needle breakage have been reported. Careful instruction in proper patient handling and injection techniques may minimize this risk (  5.7  ). 
 *   Benzyl alcohol: Serious and fatal adverse reactions can occur in neonates and low birth weight infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved formulations in infusion solutions, including CAVERJECT. CAVERJECT is not indicated in neonates and infants (  5.8  ). 
 *   Counseling patients about sexually transmitted diseases: Counsel patients about the protective measures necessary to guard against sexually transmitted disease including the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (  5.9  ). 
    
 

   5.1 Prolonged Erection and Priapism



  Prolonged erection defined as erection lasting between 4 to 6 hours in duration occurred in 4% of 1,861 patients treated up to 18 months in studies of CAVERJECT. The incidence of priapism (erections lasting more than 6 hours in duration) was 0.4%. In the event of an erection that persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency may result.



 To minimize the chances of prolonged erection or priapism, CAVERJECT should be titrated slowly to the lowest effective dose [  see   Dosage and Administration (2.1)  ].  In addition, do not use CAVERJECT in patients who have conditions that predispose them to priapism, such as sickle cell anemia or sickle cell trait, multiple myeloma, or leukemia [see  Contraindications (4)  ]  .



    5.2 Penile Fibrosis



  The overall incidence of penile fibrosis, reported in clinical studies with CAVERJECT was 3%. In one self-injection clinical study where duration of use was up to 18 months, the incidence of penile fibrosis was 7.8%.



 Physical examination of the penis should be performed periodically, to detect signs of penile fibrosis. Treatment with CAVERJECT should be discontinued in patients who develop penile angulation or cavernosal fibrosis.



    5.3 Hypotension



  Intracavernous injections of CAVERJECT can increase peripheral blood levels of alprostadil which can result in hypotension. Avoid use of CAVERJECT in patients with known cavernosal venous leakage.



    5.4 Injection Site Bleeding When Used With Anticoagulants



  Patients on anticoagulants, such as warfarin or heparin, may have increased propensity for injection site bleeding after intracavernosal injection with CAVERJECT. Compress the site of injection with an alcohol swab or sterile gauze for 5 minutes.



    5.5 Cardiovascular Risk Related to Underlying Medical Conditions



  There is a potential for cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including CAVERJECT, generally should not be used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable because of their underlying cardiovascular status. In addition, the evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a determination of potential underlying causes and the identification of appropriate treatment following a complete medical assessment.



    5.6 Risks of Use in Combination with Other Vasoactive Medications Injected Intracavernosally



  The safety and efficacy of combinations of CAVERJECT and other vasoactive agents injected intracavernosally have not been established in clinical studies. The risks of prolonged erection, priapism, and hypotension may be increased.



    5.7 Needle Breakage



  Separate needles should be used for reconstitution and administration. CAVERJECT uses a superfine needle for administration. As with all superfine needles, the possibility of needle breakage exists. Needle breakage, with a portion of the needle remaining in the penis, has been reported and, in some cases, required hospitalization and surgical removal. Careful instruction in proper patient handling and injection techniques may minimize the potential for needle breakage [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ]  .



    5.8 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative



  When reconstituted using the recommended diluent, the solution contains benzyl alcohol. Serious and fatal adverse reactions including "gasping syndrome" can occur in neonates and low birth weight infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved formulations in infusion solutions, including CAVERJECT. The "gasping syndrome" is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. CAVERJECT is not indicated for use in neonates or infants.



    5.9 Counseling Patients about Sexually Transmitted Diseases



  The use of CAVERJECT offers no protection against sexually transmitted diseases. Counseling of patients about the protective measures necessary to guard against sexually transmitted diseases, including the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is advised.
