  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



   Clinical Trials Experience in Adult Subjects  



   Treatment-Naive Subjects:  The safety assessment of TIVICAY in HIV-1-infected treatment-naive subjects is based on the analyses of data from 2 international, multicenter, double-blind trials, SPRING-2 (ING113086) and SINGLE (ING114467) and data from the international, multicenter, open-label FLAMINGO (ING114915) trial.



 In SPRING-2, 822 subjects were randomized and received at least 1 dose of either TIVICAY 50 mg once daily or raltegravir 400 mg twice daily, both in combination with fixed-dose dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) treatment (either abacavir sulfate and lamivudine [EPZICOM] or emtricitabine/tenofovir [TRUVADA]). There were 808 subjects included in the efficacy and safety analyses. Through 96 weeks, the rate of adverse events leading to discontinuation was 2% in both treatment arms.



 In SINGLE, 833 subjects were randomized and received at least 1 dose of either TIVICAY 50 mg with fixed-dose abacavir sulfate and lamivudine (EPZICOM) once daily or fixed-dose efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir (ATRIPLA) once daily (study treatment was blinded through Week 96 and open-label from Week 96 through Week 144). Through 144 weeks, the rates of adverse events leading to discontinuation were 4% in subjects receiving TIVICAY 50 mg once daily + EPZICOM and 14% in subjects receiving ATRIPLA once daily.



 Treatment-emergent adverse reactions (ARs) of moderate to severe intensity observed in at least 2% of subjects in either treatment arm in SPRING-2 and SINGLE trials are provided in  Table 3  . Side-by-side tabulation is to simplify presentation; direct comparisons across trials should not be made due to differing trial designs.

           In addition, Grade 1 insomnia was reported by 1% and less than 1% of subjects receiving TIVICAY and raltegravir, respectively, in SPRING-2; whereas in SINGLE the rates were 7% and 4% for TIVICAY and ATRIPLA, respectively. These events were not treatment limiting.
 

 In a multicenter, open-label trial (FLAMINGO), 243 subjects received TIVICAY 50 mg once daily versus 242 subjects who received darunavir 800 mg/ritonavir 100 mg once daily, both in combination with investigator-selected NRTI background regimen (either EPZICOM or TRUVADA). There were 484 subjects included in the efficacy and safety analyses. Through 96 weeks, the rates of adverse events leading to discontinuation were 3% in subjects receiving TIVICAY and 6% in subjects receiving darunavir/ritonavir. The ARs observed in FLAMINGO were generally consistent with those seen in SPRING-2 and SINGLE.



   Treatment-Experienced, Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitor-Naive Subjects:  In an international, multicenter, double-blind trial (ING111762, SAILING), 719 HIV-1-infected, antiretroviral treatment-experienced adults were randomized and received either TIVICAY 50 mg once daily or raltegravir 400 mg twice daily with investigator-selected background regimen consisting of up to 2 agents, including at least one fully active agent. At 48 weeks, the rates of adverse events leading to discontinuation were 3% in subjects receiving TIVICAY 50 mg once daily + background regimen and 4% in subjects receiving raltegravir 400 mg twice daily + background regimen.



 The only treatment-emergent AR of moderate to severe intensity with at least 2% frequency in either treatment group was diarrhea, 2% (6 of 354) in subjects receiving TIVICAY 50 mg once daily + background regimen and 1% (5 of 361) in subjects receiving raltegravir 400 mg twice daily + background regimen.



   Treatment-Experienced, Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitor-Experienced Subjects:  In a multicenter, open-label, single-arm trial (ING112574, VIKING-3), 183 HIV-1-infected, antiretroviral treatment-experienced adults with virological failure and current or historical evidence of raltegravir and/or elvitegravir resistance received TIVICAY 50 mg twice daily with the current failing background regimen for 7 days and with optimized background therapy from Day 8. The rate of adverse events leading to discontinuation was 4% of subjects at Week 48.



 Treatment-emergent ARs in VIKING-3 were generally similar compared with observations with the 50-mg once-daily dose in adult Phase 3 trials.



              Virologically Suppressed Subjects:  The ARs observed for TIVICAY plus rilpivirine in the Week 48 analysis of pooled data from 2 identical, international, multicenter, open-label trials (SWORD-1 and SWORD-2) of 513 HIV-1-infected, virologically suppressed subjects switching from their current antiretroviral regimen to dolutegravir plus rilpivirine, were consistent with the AR profiles and severities for the individual components when administered with other antiretroviral agents. There were no ARs (Grades 2 to 4) with an incidence of at least 2% in either treatment arm. The rates of adverse events leading to discontinuation were 4% in subjects receiving TIVICAY plus rilpivirine once daily and less than 1% in subjects who remained on their current antiretroviral regimen.



   Less Common Adverse Reactions Observed in Treatment-Naive and Treatment-Experienced Trials:  The following ARs occurred in less than 2% of treatment-naive or treatment-experienced subjects receiving TIVICAY in a combination regimen in any one trial. These events have been included because of their seriousness and assessment of potential causal relationship.



              Gastrointestinal Disorders:  Abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, flatulence, upper abdominal pain, vomiting.



              Hepatobiliary Disorders:  Hepatitis.



              Musculoskeletal Disorders:  Myositis.



              Psychiatric Disorders:  Suicidal ideation, attempt, behavior, or completion. These events were observed primarily in subjects with a pre-existing history of depression or other psychiatric illness.



              Renal and Urinary Disorders:  Renal impairment.



              Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders:  Pruritus.



   Laboratory Abnormalities:  



              Treatment-Naive Subjects:  Selected laboratory abnormalities (Grades 2 to 4) with a worsening grade from baseline and representing the worst-grade toxicity in at least 2% of subjects are presented in  Table 4  . The mean change from baseline observed for selected lipid values is presented in  Table 5  . Side-by-side tabulation is to simplify presentation; direct comparisons across trials should not be made due to differing trial designs.

           Laboratory abnormalities observed in the FLAMINGO trial were generally consistent with observations in SPRING-2 and SINGLE.
 

            Treatment-Experienced, Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitor-Naive Subjects:  Laboratory abnormalities observed in SAILING were generally similar compared with observations seen in the treatment-naive (SPRING-2 and SINGLE) trials.



            Treatment-Experienced, Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitor-Experienced Subjects:  The most common treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities (greater than 5% for Grades 2 to 4 combined) observed in VIKING-3 at Week 48 were elevated ALT (9%), AST (8%), cholesterol (10%), creatine kinase (6%), hyperglycemia (14%), and lipase (10%). Two percent (4 of 183) of subjects had a Grade 3 to 4 treatment-emergent hematology laboratory abnormality, with neutropenia (2% [3 of 183]) being the most frequently reported.



            Virologically Suppressed Adults:  Laboratory abnormalities observed in SWORD-1 and SWORD-2 were generally similar compared with observations seen in the other Phase 3 trials.



            Hepatitis B and/or Hepatitis C Virus Co-infection:  In Phase 3 trials, subjects with hepatitis B and/or C virus co-infection were permitted to enroll provided that baseline liver chemistry tests did not exceed 5 times the upper limit of normal. Overall, the safety profile in subjects with hepatitis B and/or C virus co-infection was similar to that observed in subjects without hepatitis B or C co-infection, although the rates of AST and ALT abnormalities were higher in the subgroup with hepatitis B and/or C virus co-infection for all treatment groups. Grades 2 to 4 ALT abnormalities in hepatitis B and/or C co-infected compared with HIV mono-infected subjects receiving TIVICAY were observed in 18% vs. 3% with the 50-mg once-daily dose and 13% vs. 8% with the 50-mg twice-daily dose. Liver chemistry elevations consistent with immune reconstitution syndrome were observed in some subjects with hepatitis B and/or C at the start of therapy with TIVICAY, particularly in the setting where anti-hepatitis therapy was withdrawn  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )]  .



   Changes in Serum Creatinine:  Dolutegravir has been shown to increase serum creatinine due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine without affecting renal glomerular function  [see Clinical Pharmacology (  12.2  )]  . Increases in serum creatinine occurred within the first 4 weeks of treatment and remained stable through 96 weeks. In treatment-naive subjects, a mean change from baseline of 0.15 mg per dL (range: -0.32 mg per dL to 0.65 mg per dL) was observed after 96 weeks of treatment. Creatinine increases were comparable by background NRTIs and were similar in treatment-experienced subjects.



   Clinical Trials Experience in Pediatric Subjects  



 IMPAACT P1093 is an ongoing multicenter, open-label, non-comparative trial of approximately 160 HIV-1-infected pediatric subjects aged 4 weeks to less than 18 years, of which 46 treatment-experienced, INSTI-naive subjects aged 6 to less than 18 years have been enrolled  [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.4  ), Clinical Studies (  14.2  )].  



 The adverse reaction profile was similar to that for adults. Grade 2 ARs reported by more than one subject were decreased neutrophil count (n = 3) and diarrhea (n = 2). There were no Grade 3 or 4 drug-related ARs reported. No ARs led to discontinuation.



 The Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities reported in more than one subject were elevated total bilirubin (n = 3) and decreased neutrophil count (n = 2). The changes in mean serum creatinine were similar to those observed in adults.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Hepatobiliary Disorders  



 Acute liver failure, hepatotoxicity.



   Investigations  



 Weight increased.



   Musculoskeletal  



 Arthralgia, myalgia.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *    Hypersensitivity reactions characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and sometimes organ dysfunction, including liver injury, have been reported. Discontinue TIVICAY and other suspect agents immediately if signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions develop, as a delay in stopping treatment may result in a life-threatening reaction. (  5.1  ) 
 *    Hepatotoxicity has been reported in patients receiving dolutegravir-containing regimens. Patients with underlying hepatitis B or C may be at increased risk for worsening or development of transaminase elevations. Monitoring for hepatotoxicity is recommended. (  5.2  ) 
 *    Embryo-fetal toxicity may occur when used at the time of conception and in early pregnancy. Avoid use of TIVICAY at the time of conception through the first trimester of pregnancy due to the risk of neural tube defects. Advise adolescents and adults of childbearing potential to use effective contraception. (  2.1  ,  5.3  ,  8.1  ,  8.3  ) 
 *    Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. (  5.5  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions



  Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported and were characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and sometimes organ dysfunction, including liver injury. The events were reported in less than 1% of subjects receiving TIVICAY in Phase 3 clinical trials. Discontinue TIVICAY and other suspect agents immediately if signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions develop (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters or peeling of the skin, oral blisters or lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, hepatitis, eosinophilia, angioedema, difficulty breathing). Clinical status, including liver aminotransferases, should be monitored and appropriate therapy initiated. Delay in stopping treatment with TIVICAY or other suspect agents after the onset of hypersensitivity may result in a life-threatening reaction. TIVICAY is contraindicated in patients who have experienced a previous hypersensitivity reaction to dolutegravir.



    5.2 Hepatotoxicity



   Hepatic adverse events have been reported in patients receiving a dolutegravir-containing regimen. Patients with underlying hepatitis B or C may be at increased risk for worsening or development of transaminase elevations with use of TIVICAY [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )].  In some cases, the elevations in transaminases were consistent with immune reconstitution syndrome or hepatitis B reactivation particularly in the setting where anti-hepatitis therapy was withdrawn. Cases of hepatic toxicity, including elevated serum liver biochemistries, hepatitis, and acute liver failure have been reported in patients receiving a dolutegravir-containing regimen without pre-existing hepatic disease or other identifiable risk factors. Drug-induced liver injury leading to liver transplant has been reported with TRIUMEQ (abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine). Monitoring for hepatotoxicity is recommended.  



    5.3 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



   Preliminary data from an observational study showed that TIVICAY was associated with increased risk of neural tube defects when administered at the time of conception and in early pregnancy. As there is limited understanding of reported types of neural tube defects associated with dolutegravir use and because the date of conception may not be determined with precision, avoid use of TIVICAY at the time of conception through the first trimester of pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  )].    



  If there are plans to become pregnant or if pregnancy is confirmed within the first trimester while on TIVICAY, if possible, switch to an alternative regimen.  



  Perform pregnancy testing before initiation of TIVICAY in adolescents and adults of childbearing potential to exclude use of TIVICAY during the first trimester of pregnancy [see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  )].    



  Advise adolescents and adults of childbearing potential to consistently use effective contraception [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  ,  8.3  )].    



    5.4 Risk of Adverse Reactions or Loss of Virologic Response Due to Drug Interactions



   The concomitant use of TIVICAY and other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to [see Contraindications (  4  ), Drug Interactions (  7.3  )]:    



 *     Loss of therapeutic effect of TIVICAY and possible development of resistance.  
 *     Possible clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of concomitant drugs.  
     For concomitant drugs for which the interaction can be mitigated, please see    Table 6   for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during therapy with TIVICAY; review concomitant medications during therapy with TIVICAY; and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drugs.  
 

    5.5 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome



  Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including TIVICAY. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium  infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii  pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.



 Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.
