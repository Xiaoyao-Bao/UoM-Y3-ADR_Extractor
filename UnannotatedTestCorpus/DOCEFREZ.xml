  The most serious adverse reactions from docetaxel are:



 *  Toxic Deaths [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )]  
 *  Hepatotoxicity [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )]  
 *  Neutropenia [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  )]  
 *  Hypersensitivity [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (  5.4  )]  
 *  Fluid Retention [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (  5.5  )]  
    The most common adverse reactions across all docetaxel indications are infections, neutropenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypersensitivity, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, dysgeusia, dyspnea, constipation, anorexia, nail disorders, fluid retention, asthenia, pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, mucositis, alopecia, skin reactions, and myalgia. Incidence varies depending on the indication. Adverse reactions are described for docetaxel according to indication. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Responding patients may not experience an improvement in performance status on therapy and may experience worsening. The relationship between changes in performance status, response to therapy, and treatment-related side effects has not been established.
 

   EXCERPT:   Most common adverse reactions across all docetaxel indications are infections, neutropenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypersensitivity, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, dysgeusia, dyspnea, constipation, anorexia, nail disorders, fluid retention, asthenia, pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, mucositis, alopecia, skin reactions, myalgia (  6  )  To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc. at 1-800-818-4555 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch  



 

  6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

    Breast Cancer    Monotherapy with docetaxel for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy  



 Docetaxel 100 mg/m  2  : Adverse drug reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients are compared for three populations who received docetaxel administered at 100 mg/m  2  as a 1-hour infusion every 3 weeks: 2045 patients with various tumor types and normal baseline liver function tests; the subset of 965 patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, both previously treated and untreated with chemotherapy, who had normal baseline liver function tests; and an additional 61 patients with various tumor types who had abnormal liver function tests at baseline. These reactions were described using COSTART terms and were considered possibly or probably related to docetaxel. At least 95% of these patients did not receive hematopoietic support. The safety profile is generally similar in patients receiving docetaxel for the treatment of breast cancer and in patients with other tumor types (See Table 2).

        Hematologic Reactions  
 

 Reversible marrow suppression was the major dose-limiting toxicity of docetaxel  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  )].  The median time to nadir was 7 days, while the median duration of severe neutropenia (&lt;500 cells/mm  3  ) was 7 days. Among 2045 patients with solid tumors and normal baseline LFTs, severe neutropenia occurred in 75.4% and lasted for more than 7 days in 2.9% of cycles.



 Febrile neutropenia (&lt;500 cells/mm  3  with fever &gt; 38 degrees C with intravenous antibiotics and/or hospitalization) occurred in 11% of patients with solid tumors, in 12.3% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 9.8% of 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids.



 Severe infectious episodes occurred in 6.1% of patients with solid tumors, in 6.4% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 5.4% of 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids.



 Thrombocytopenia (&lt;100,000 cells/mm  3  ) associated with fatal gastrointestinal hemorrhage has been reported.



   Hypersensitivity Reactions  



 Severe hypersensitivity reactions have been reported  [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (  5.4  )]  . Minor events, including flushing, rash with or without pruritus, chest tightness, back pain, dyspnea, drug fever, or chills, have been reported and resolved after discontinuing the infusion and instituting appropriate therapy.



   Fluid Retention  



 Fluid retention can occur with the use of DOCEFREZ  [see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration (  2.6  ), Warnings and Precautions (  5.5  )]  .



   Cutaneous Reactions  



 Severe skin toxicity is discussed elsewhere in the label  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.7  )].  Reversible cutaneous reactions characterized by a rash including localized eruptions, mainly on the feet and/or hands, but also on the arms, face, or thorax, usually associated with pruritus, have been observed. Eruptions generally occurred within 1 week after docetaxel infusion, recovered before the next infusion, and were not disabling.



 Severe nail disorders were characterized by hypo- or hyperpigmentation, and occasionally by onycholysis (in 0.8% of patients with solid tumors) and pain.



   Neurologic Reactions  



 Neurologic reactions are discussed elsewhere in the label    [      see    Warnings and Precautions (  5.8  )].  



   Gastrointestinal Reactions  



 Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were generally mild to moderate. Severe reactions occurred in 3-5% of patients with solid tumors and to a similar extent among metastatic breast cancer patients. The incidence of severe reactions was 1% or less for the 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids.



 Severe stomatitis occurred in 5.5% of patients with solid tumors, in 7.4% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 1.1% of the 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids.



   Cardiovascular Reactions  



 Hypotension occurred in 2.8% of patients with solid tumors; 1.2% required treatment. Clinically meaningful events such as heart failure, sinus tachycardia, atrial flutter, dysrhythmia, unstable angina, pulmonary edema, and hypertension occurred rarely. Seven of 86 patients (8.1%) of metastatic breast cancer patients receiving docetaxel 100 mg/m  2  in a randomized trial and who had serial left ventricular ejection fractions assessed developed deterioration of LVEF by &gt;= 10% associated with a drop below the institutional lower limit of normal.



   Infusion Site Reactions  



 Infusion site reactions were generally mild and consisted of hyperpigmentation, inflammation, redness or dryness of the skin, phlebitis, extravasation, or swelling of the vein.



   Hepatic Reactions  



 In patients with normal LFTs at baseline, bilirubin values greater than the ULN occurred in 8.9% of patients. Increases in AST or ALT &gt; 1.5 times the ULN, or alkaline phosphatase &gt; 2.5 times ULN, were observed in 18.9% and 7.3% of patients, respectively. While on docetaxel, increases in AST and/or ALT &gt; 1.5 times ULN concomitant with alkaline phosphatase &gt; 2.5 times ULN occurred in 4.3% of patients with normal LFTs at baseline. Whether these changes were related to the drug or underlying disease has not been established.



   Hematologic and Other Toxicity: Relation to dose and baseline liver chemistry abnormalities  



 Hematologic and other toxicity is increased at higher doses and in patients with elevated baseline liver function tests (LFTs). In the following tables, adverse drug reactions are compared for three populations: 730 patients with normal LFTs given docetaxel at 100 mg/m  2  in the randomized and single arm studies of metastatic breast cancer after failure of previous chemotherapy; 18 patients in these studies who had abnormal baseline LFTs (defined as AST and/or ALT &gt; 1.5 times ULN concurrent with alkaline phosphatase &gt; 2.5 times ULN); and 174 patients in Japanese studies given docetaxel at 60 mg/m  2  who had normal LFTs (see Tables 3 and 4).

      In the three-arm monotherapy trial, TAX313, which compared docetaxel 60 mg/m  2  , 75 mg/m  2  and 100 mg/m  2  in advanced breast cancer, grade 3/4 or severe adverse reactions occurred in 49.0% of patients treated with docetaxel 60 mg/m  2  compared to 55.3% and 65.9% treated with 75 mg/m  2  and 100 mg/m  2  respectively. Discontinuation due to adverse reactions was reported in 5.3% of patients treated with 60 mg/m  2  vs. 6.9% and 16.5% for patients treated at 75 mg/m  2  and 100 mg/m  2  respectively. Deaths within 30 days of last treatment occurred in 4.0% of patients treated with 60 mg/m  2  compared to 5.3% and 1.6% for patients treated at 75 mg/m  2  and 100 mg/m  2  respectively.The following adverse reactions were associated with increasing docetaxel doses: fluid retention (26%, 38%, and 46% at 60 mg/m  2  , 75 mg/m  2  , and 100 mg/m  2  respectively), thrombocytopenia (7%, 11%, and 12% respectively), neutropenia (92%, 94%, and 97% respectively), febrile neutropenia (5%, 7%, and 14% respectively), treatment-related grade 3/4 infection (2%, 3%, and 7% respectively) and anemia (87%, 94%, and 97% respectively).Lung CancerMonotherapy with docetaxel for unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapyDocetaxel 75 mg/m  2  : Treatment emergent adverse drug reactions are shown in Table 5. Included in this table are safety data for a total of 176 patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma and a history of prior treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy who were treated in two randomized, controlled trials. These reactions were described using NCI Common Toxicity Criteria regardless of relationship to study treatment, except for the hematologic toxicities or where otherwise noted.

      Deaths within 30 days of last study treatment occurred in 31 patients (7.6%) in the docetaxel+cisplatin arm and 37 patients (9.3%) in the vinorelbine+cisplatin arm. Deaths within 30 days of last study treatment attributed to study drug occurred in 9 patients (2.2%) in the docetaxel+cisplatin arm and 8 patients (2%) in the vinorelbine+cisplatin arm. The second comparison in the study, vinorelbine+cisplatin versus docetaxel+carboplatin (which did not demonstrate a superior survival associated with DOCEFREZ,  [see Clinical Studies (  14.3  )]  ) demonstrated a higher incidence of thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, fluid retention, hypersensitivity reactions, skin toxicity, alopecia and nail changes on the docetaxel+carboplatin arm, while a higher incidence of anemia, neurosensory toxicity, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and asthenia was observed on the vinorelbine+cisplatin arm.
 

   Prostate Cancer  Combination therapy with docetaxel in patients with prostate cancerThe following data are based on the experience of 332 patients, who were treated with docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks in combination with prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily (see Table 7).

        6.2 Post Marketing Experiences
   The following adverse reactions have been identified from clinical trials and/or post-marketing surveillance. Because they are reported from a population of unknown size, precise estimates of frequency cannot be made.  Body as a whole  : diffuse pain, chest pain, radiation recall phenomenon.   Cardiovascular  : atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, ECG abnormalities, thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism, syncope, tachycardia, myocardial infarction.   Cutaneous  : very rare cases of cutaneous lupus erythematosus and rare cases of bullous eruptions such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and Scleroderma-like changes usually preceded by peripheral lymphedema. In some cases multiple factors may have contributed to the development of these effects. Severe hand and foot syndrome has been reported.   Gastrointestinal  : abdominal pain, anorexia, constipation, duodenal ulcer, esophagitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, gastrointestinal perforation, ischemic colitis, colitis, intestinal obstruction, ileus, neutropenic enterocolitis and dehydration as a consequence to gastrointestinal events have been reported.   Hematologic  : bleeding episodes. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), often in association with sepsis or multiorgan failure, has been reported. Cases of acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplasic syndrome have been reported in association with docetaxel when used in combination with other chemotherapy agents and/or radiotherapy.   Hypersensitivity  : rare cases of anaphylactic shock have been reported. Very rarely these cases resulted in a fatal outcome in patients who received premedication.   Hepatic  : rare cases of hepatitis, sometimes fatal primarily in patients with pre-existing liver disorders, have been reported.   Neurologic  : confusion, rare cases of seizures or transient loss of consciousness have been observed, sometimes appearing during the infusion of the drug.   Ophthalmologic  : conjunctivitis, lacrimation or lacrimation with or without conjunctivitis. Excessive tearing which may be attributable to lacrimal duct obstruction has been reported. Rare cases of transient visual disturbances (flashes, flashing lights, scotomata) typically occurring during drug infusion and in association with hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. These were reversible upon discontinuation of the infusion. Cases of cystoid macular edema (CME) have been reported in patients treated with DOCEFREZ.   Hearing  : rare cases of ototoxicity, hearing disorders and/or hearing loss have been reported, including cases associated with other ototoxic drugs.   Respiratory:  dyspnea, acute pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome/pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, interstitial pneumonia, respiratory failure, and pulmonary fibrosis have rarely been reported and may be associated with fatal outcome. Rare cases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients receiving concomitant radiotherapy.  



   Renal  : renal insufficiency and renal failure have been reported, the majority of these cases were associated with concomitant nephrotoxic drugs.  Metabolism and nutrition disorders:  cases of hyponatremia have been reported.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING

  WARNING

    TOXIC DEATHS, HEPATOTOXICITY, NEUTROPENIA, HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS, and FLUID RETENTION   The incidence of treatment-related mortality associated with docetaxel therapy is increased in patients with abnormal liver function, in patients receiving higher doses, and in patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma and a history of prior treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy who receive docetaxel as a single agent at a dose of 100 mg/m  2            [see Warnings and Precautions    (  5.1  )].      DOCEFREZ should not be given to patients with bilirubin &gt; upper limit of normal (ULN), or to patients with AST and/or ALT &gt;1.5 x ULN concomitant with alkaline phosphatase &gt;2.5 x ULN. Patients with elevations of bilirubin or abnormalities of transaminase concurrent with alkaline phosphatase are at increased risk for the development of grade 4 neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, infections, severe thrombocytopenia, severe stomatitis, severe skin toxicity, and toxic death. Patients with isolated elevations of transaminase &gt;1.5 x ULN also had a higher rate of febrile neutropenia grade 4 but did not have an increased incidence of toxic death. Bilirubin, AST or ALT, and alkaline phosphatase values should be obtained prior to each cycle of DOCEFREZ therapy   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )].           DOCEFREZ therapy should not be given to patients with neutrophil counts of &lt;1,500 cells/mm  3  . In order to monitor the occurrence of neutropenia, which may be severe and result in infection, frequent blood cell counts should be performed on all patients receiving DOCEFREZ  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  )].           Severe hypersensitivity reactions characterized by generalized rash/erythema, hypotension and/or bronchospasm, or very rarely fatal anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients who received a 3-day dexamethasone premedication. Hypersensitivity reactions require immediate discontinuation of the DOCEFREZ infusion and administration of appropriate therapy   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.4  )]  . DOCEFREZ must not be given to patients who have a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to docetaxel or to other drugs formulated with polysorbate 80   [see Contraindications (  4  )].           Severe fluid retention occurred in 6.5% (6/92) of patients despite use of a 3-day dexamethasone premedication regimen. It was characterized by one or more of the following events: poorly tolerated peripheral edema, generalized edema, pleural effusion requiring urgent drainage, dyspnea at rest, cardiac tamponade, or pronounced abdominal distention (due to ascites)   [see     Warnings and Precautions (  5.5  )].    



   EXCERPT:       WARNING: TOXIC DEATHS, HEPATOTOXICITY, NEUTROPENIA, HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS, and FLUID RETENTION    See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning    



 *  Treatment-related mortality increases with abnormal liver function, at higher doses, and in patients with NSCLC and prior platinum-based therapy receiving docetaxel at 100 mg/m2 (5.1) 
 *  Should not be given if bilirubin &gt; ULN, or if AST and/or ALT &gt; 1.5 x ULN concomitant with alkaline phosphatase &gt; 2.5 x ULN. LFT elevations increase risk of severe or life-threatening complications. Obtain LFTs before each treatment cycle (8.6) 
 *  Should not be given if neutrophil counts are &lt;1,500 cells/mm3. Obtain frequent blood counts to monitor for neutropenia (4) 
 *  Severe hypersensitivity, including very rare fatal anaphylaxis, has been reported in patients who received dexamethasone premedication. Severe reactions require immediate discontinuation of DOCEFREZ and administration of appropriate therapy (5.4) 
 *  Contraindicated if history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to docetaxel or to drugs formulated with polysorbate 80  (4) 
 *  Severe fluid retention may occur despite dexamethasone (5.5)

   EXCERPT:    *  Acute myeloid leukemia: In patients who received docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, monitor for delayed myelodysplasia or myeloid leukemia (  5.6  ) 
 *  Cutaneous reactions:  Reactions including erythema of the extremities with edema followed by desquamation may occur. Severe skin toxicity may require dose adjustment (  5.7  ) 
 *  Neurologic reactions: Reactions including. paresthesia, dysesthesia, and pain may occur.  Severe neurosensory symptoms require dose adjustment or discontinuation if persistent. (  5.8  ) 
 *  Eye disorders: Cystoid macular edema (CME) has been reported and requires treatment discontinuation. (  5.9  ) 
 *   Alcohol content: The alcohol content in a dose of Docetaxel Injection may affect the central nervous system. This may include impairment of a patient's ability to drive or use machines immediately after infusion. (5.10) 
 *  Asthenia: Severe asthenia may occur and may require treatment discontinuation. (  5.11  ) 
 *  Pregnancy: Fetal harm can occur when administered to a pregnant woman. Women of childbearing potential should be advised not to become pregnant when receiving DOCEFREZ (  5.12  ,   8.1  )  
    
 

   5.1 Toxic Deaths



      Breast Cancer  DOCEFREZ administered at 100 mg/m  2  was associated with deaths considered possibly or probably related to treatment in 2.0% (19/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients, both previously treated and untreated, with normal baseline liver function and in 11.5% (7/61) of patients with various tumor types who had abnormal baseline liver function (AST and/or ALT &gt;1.5 times ULN together with AP &gt;2.5 times ULN). Among patients dosed at 60 mg/m  2  , mortality related to treatment occurred in 0.6% (3/481) of patients with normal liver function, and in 3 of 7 patients with abnormal liver function. Approximately half of these deaths occurred during the first cycle. Sepsis accounted for the majority of the deaths.  Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer  DOCEFREZ administered at a dose of 100 mg/m  2   in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who had a history of prior platinum-based chemotherapy was associated with increased treatment-related mortality (14% and 5% in two randomized, controlled studies). There were 2.8% treatment-related deaths among the 176 patients treated at the 75 mg/m  2   dose in the randomized trials. Among patients who experienced treatment-related mortality at the 75 mg/m  2   dose level, 3 of 5 patients had an ECOG PS of 2 at study entry [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  ), Clinical Studies (  14  )].  
 

    5.2 Hepatic Impairment



     Patients with combined abnormalities of transaminases and alkaline phosphatase should not be treated with DOCEFREZ [see Boxed Warning, Use in Specific Populations (  8.6  ), Clinical studies (  14  )].  
 

    5.3 Hematologic Effects



     Perform frequent peripheral blood cell counts on all patients receiving DOCEFREZ. Patients should not be retreated with subsequent cycles of DOCEFREZ until neutrophils recover to a level &gt; 1,500 cells/mm  3  and platelets recover to a level &gt; 100,000 cells/mm  3  . A 25% reduction in the dose of DOCEFREZ is recommended during subsequent cycles following severe neutropenia (&lt;500 cells/mm  3  ) lasting 7 days or more, febrile neutropenia, or a grade 4 infection in a DOCEFREZ cycle [see Dosage and Administration (  2.7  )].   Neutropenia (&lt;2000 neutrophils/mm  3  ) occurs in virtually all patients given 60 mg/m  2   to 100 mg/m  2   of docetaxel and grade 4 neutropenia (&lt;500 cells/mm  3  ) occurs in 85% of patients given 100 mg/m  2   and 75% of patients given 60 mg/m  2  . Frequent monitoring of blood counts is, therefore, essential so that dose can be adjusted. DOCEFREZ should not be administered to patients with neutrophils &lt;1,500 cells/mm  3  . Febrile neutropenia occurred in about 12% of patients given 100 mg/m  2   but was very uncommon in patients given 60 mg/m  2  . Hematologic responses, febrile reactions and infections, and rates of septic death for different regimens are dose related [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  ), Clinical Studies (  14  )].   Three breast cancer patients with severe liver impairment (bilirubin &gt;1.7 times ULN) developed fatal gastrointestinal bleeding associated with severe drug-induced thrombocytopenia. [see Dosage and Administration (  2.7  ), Adverse Reactions (  6  )]  .
 

    5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions



     Patients should be observed closely for hypersensitivity reactions, especially during the first and second infusions. Severe hypersensitivity reactions characterized by generalized rash/erythema, hypotension and/or bronchospasm, or very rarely fatal anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients premedicated with 3 days of corticosteroids. Severe hypersensitivity reactions require immediate discontinuation of the DOCEFREZ infusion and aggressive therapy. Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions should not be rechallenged with DOCEFREZ. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur within a few minutes following initiation of a DOCEFREZ infusion. If minor reactions such as flushing or localized skin reactions occur, interruption of therapy is not required. All patients should be premedicated with an oral corticosteroid prior to the initiation of the infusion of DOCEFREZ [see Dosage and Administration (  2.6  )].  
 

    5.5 Fluid Retention



     Severe fluid retention has been reported following docetaxel therapy. Patients should be premedicated with oral corticosteroids prior to each DOCEFREZ administration to reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention [see Dosage and Administration (  2.6  )]  . Patients with pre-existing effusions should be closely monitored from the first dose for the possible exacerbation of the effusions. When fluid retention occurs, peripheral edema usually starts in the lower extremities and may become generalized with a median weight gain of 2 kg.Among 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids, moderate fluid retention occurred in 27.2% and severe fluid retention in 6.5%. The median cumulative dose to onset of moderate or severe fluid retention was 819 mg/m  2  . Nine of 92 patients (9.8%) of patients discontinued treatment due to fluid retention: 4 patients discontinued with severe fluid retention; the remaining 5 had mild or moderate fluid retention. The median cumulative dose to treatment discontinuation due to fluid retention was 1,021 mg/m  2  .Fluid retention was completely, but sometimes slowly, reversible with a median of 16 weeks from the last infusion of docetaxel to resolution (range: 0 to 42+ weeks). Patients developing peripheral edema may be treated with standard measures, e.g  ., salt restriction, oral diuretic(s).
 

    5.6 Acute Myeloid Leukemia



     Treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplasia has occurred in patients given anthracyclines and/or cyclophosphamide, including use in adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. The risk of delayed myelodysplasia or myeloid leukemia requires hematological follow-up.
 

    5.7 Cutaneous Reactions



     Localized erythema of the extremities with edema followed by desquamation has been observed. In case of severe skin toxicity, an adjustment in dosage is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (  2.7  )]  . The discontinuation rate due to skin toxicity was 1.6% (15/965) for metastatic breast cancer patients. Among 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids, there were no cases of severe skin toxicity reported and no patient discontinued docetaxel due to skin toxicity.
 

    5.8 Neurologic Reactions



     Severe neurosensory symptoms ( e.g  .paresthesia, dysesthesia, pain) were observed in 5.5% (53/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients, and resulted in treatment discontinuation in 6.1%. When these symptoms occur, dosage must be adjusted. If symptoms persist, treatment should be discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (  2.7  )].  Patients who experienced neurotoxicity in clinical trials and for whom follow-up information on the complete resolution of the event was available had spontaneous reversal of symptoms with a median of 9 weeks from onset (range: 0 to 106 weeks). Severe peripheral motor neuropathy mainly manifested as distal extremity weakness occurred in 4.4% (42/965).
 

    5.9 Eye Disorders



   Cystoid  macular edema (CME) has been reported in patients treated with DOCEFREZ. Patients with impaired vision should undergo a prompt and comprehensive ophthalmologic examination. If CME is diagnosed, DOCEFREZ treatment should be discontinued and appropriate treatment initiated. Alternative non-taxane cancer treatment should be considered.



    5.10 Alcohol Content



      Cases  of intoxication have been reported with some formulations of docetaxel due to the alcohol content. The alcohol content in a dose of Docetaxel Injection may affect the central nervous system and should be taken into account for patients in whom alcohol intake should be avoided or minimized. Consideration should be given to the alcohol content in Docetaxel Injection on the ability to drive or use machines immediately after the infusion.    
 

     



  Each  administration of Docetaxel Injection at 100 mg/m  2  delivers 1.425 g/m  2  of ethanol. For a patient with a BSA of 2.0 m  2  , this would deliver 2.85 grams of ethanol [see Description (  11  )]  . Other docetaxel products may have a different amount of alcohol.



    5.11 Asthenia



     Severe asthenia has been reported in 14.9% (144/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients but has led to treatment discontinuation in only 1.8%. Symptoms of fatigue and weakness may last a few days up to several weeks and may be associated with deterioration of performance status in patients with progressive disease.
 

    5.12 Use in Pregnancy



     DOCEFREZ can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Docetaxel caused embryofetal toxicities including intrauterine mortality when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis. Embryofetal effects in animals occurred at doses as low as 1/50 and 1/300 the recommended human dose on a body surface area basis. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women using DOCEFREZ. If DOCEFREZ is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant during therapy with DOCEFREZ [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  )]  .
