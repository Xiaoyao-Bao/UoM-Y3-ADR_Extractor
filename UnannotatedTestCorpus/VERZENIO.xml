  6.1 Clinical Studies Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     MONARCH 3: VERZENIO in Combination with an Aromatase Inhibitor (Anastrozole or Letrozole) as Initial Endocrine-Based Therapy  



     Postmenopausal Women with HR-positive, HER2-negative locoregionally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer with no prior systemic therapy in this disease setting  



 MONARCH 3 was a study of 488 women receiving VERZENIO plus an aromatase inhibitor or placebo plus an aromatase inhibitor. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 150 mg of VERZENIO or placebo orally twice daily, plus physician's choice of anastrozole or letrozole once daily. Median duration of treatment was 15.1 months for the VERZENIO arm and 13.9 months for the placebo arm. Median dose compliance was 98% for the VERZENIO arm and 99% for the placebo arm.



 Dose reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 43% of patients receiving VERZENIO plus anastrozole or letrozole. Adverse reactions leading to dose reductions in &gt;=5% of patients were diarrhea and neutropenia. VERZENIO dose reductions due to diarrhea of any grade occurred in 13% of patients receiving VERZENIO plus an aromatase inhibitor compared to 2% of patients receiving placebo plus an aromatase inhibitor. VERZENIO dose reductions due to neutropenia of any grade occurred in 11% of patients receiving VERZENIO plus an aromatase inhibitor compared to 0.6% of patients receiving placebo plus an aromatase inhibitor.



 Permanent treatment discontinuation due to an adverse event was reported in 13% of patients receiving VERZENIO plus an aromatase inhibitor and in 3% of patients receiving placebo plus an aromatase inhibitor. Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation for patients receiving VERZENIO plus an aromatase inhibitor were diarrhea (2%), ALT increased (2%), infection (1%), venous thromboembolic events (VTE) (1%), neutropenia (0.9%), renal impairment (0.9%), AST increased (0.6%), dyspnea (0.6%), pulmonary fibrosis (0.6%) and anemia, rash, weight decreased and thrombocytopenia (each 0.3%).



 Deaths during treatment or during the 30-day follow up, regardless of causality, were reported in 11 cases (3%) of VERZENIO plus an aromatase inhibitor treated patients versus 3 cases (2%) of placebo plus an aromatase inhibitor treated patients. Causes of death for patients receiving VERZENIO plus an aromatase inhibitor included: 3 (0.9%) patient deaths due to underlying disease, 3 (0.9%) due to lung infection, 3 (0.9%) due to VTE event, 1 (0.3%) due to pneumonitis, and 1 (0.3%) due to cerebral infarction.



 The most common adverse reactions reported (&gt;=20%) in the VERZENIO arm and &gt;=2% than the placebo arm were diarrhea, neutropenia, fatigue, infections, nausea, abdominal pain, anemia, vomiting, alopecia, decreased appetite, and leukopenia (  Table 6  ). The most frequently reported (&gt;=5%) Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were neutropenia, diarrhea, leukopenia, increased ALT, and anemia. Diarrhea incidence was greatest during the first month of VERZENIO dosing. The median time to onset of the first diarrhea event was 8 days, and the median durations of diarrhea for Grades 2 and for Grade 3 were 11 days and 8 days, respectively. Most diarrhea events recovered or resolved (88%) with supportive treatment and/or dose reductions  [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  ) and Patient Counseling Information (  17  )]  . Nineteen percent of patients with diarrhea required a dose omission and 13% required a dose reduction. The median time to the first dose reduction due to diarrhea was 38 days.

                 Creatinine Increased  
 

 Abemaciclib has been shown to increase serum creatinine due to inhibition of renal tubular secretion transporters, without affecting glomerular function  [see Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )]  . Across the clinical studies, increases in serum creatinine (mean increase, 0.2-0.3 mg/dL) occurred within the first 28-day cycle of VERZENIO dosing, remained elevated but stable through the treatment period, and were reversible upon treatment discontinuation. Alternative markers such as BUN, cystatin C, or calculated GFR, which are not based on creatinine, may be considered to determine whether renal function is impaired.



     MONARCH 2: VERZENIO in Combination with Fulvestrant  



     Women with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer with disease progression on or after prior adjuvant or metastatic endocrine therapy  



 The safety of VERZENIO (150 mg twice daily) plus fulvestrant (500 mg) versus placebo plus fulvestrant was evaluated in MONARCH 2. The data described below reflect exposure to VERZENIO in 441 patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who received at least one dose of VERZENIO plus fulvestrant in MONARCH 2.



 Median duration of treatment was 12 months for patients receiving VERZENIO plus fulvestrant and 8 months for patients receiving placebo plus fulvestrant.



 Dose reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 43% of patients receiving VERZENIO plus fulvestrant. Adverse reactions leading to dose reductions in &gt;=5% of patients were diarrhea and neutropenia. VERZENIO dose reductions due to diarrhea of any grade occurred in 19% of patients receiving VERZENIO plus fulvestrant compared to 0.4% of patients receiving placebo and fulvestrant. VERZENIO dose reductions due to neutropenia of any grade occurred in 10% of patients receiving VERZENIO plus fulvestrant compared to no patients receiving placebo plus fulvestrant.



 Permanent study treatment discontinuation due to an adverse event were reported in 9% of patients receiving VERZENIO plus fulvestrant and in 3% of patients receiving placebo plus fulvestrant. Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation for patients receiving VERZENIO plus fulvestrant were infection (2%), diarrhea (1%), hepatotoxicity (1%), fatigue (0.7%), nausea (0.2%), abdominal pain (0.2%), acute kidney injury (0.2%), and cerebral infarction (0.2%).



 Deaths during treatment or during the 30-day follow up, regardless of causality, were reported in 18 cases (4%) of VERZENIO plus fulvestrant treated patients versus 10 cases (5%) of placebo plus fulvestrant treated patients. Causes of death for patients receiving VERZENIO plus fulvestrant included: 7 (2%) patient deaths due to underlying disease, 4 (0.9%) due to sepsis, 2 (0.5%) due to pneumonitis, 2 (0.5%) due to hepatotoxicity, and one (0.2%) due to cerebral infarction.



 The most common adverse reactions reported (&gt;=20%) in the VERZENIO arm were diarrhea, fatigue, neutropenia, nausea, infections, abdominal pain, anemia, leukopenia, decreased appetite, vomiting, and headache (  Table 8  ). The most frequently reported (&gt;=5%) Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were neutropenia, diarrhea, leukopenia, anemia, and infections.

                 Creatinine Increased  
 

 Abemaciclib has been shown to increase serum creatinine due to inhibition of renal tubular secretion transporters, without affecting glomerular function  [see Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )]  . In clinical studies, increases in serum creatinine (mean increase, 0.2-0.3 mg/dL) occurred within the first 28-day cycle of VERZENIO dosing, remained elevated but stable through the treatment period, and were reversible upon treatment discontinuation. Alternative markers such as BUN, cystatin C, or calculated glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which are not based on creatinine, may be considered to determine whether renal function is impaired.



     VERZENIO Administered as a Monotherapy in Metastatic Breast Cancer (MONARCH 1)  



     Patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer who received prior endocrine therapy and 1-2 chemotherapy regimens in the metastatic setting  



 Safety data below are based on MONARCH 1, a single-arm, open-label, multicenter study in 132 women with measurable HR-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. Patients received 200 mg VERZENIO orally twice daily until development of progressive disease or unmanageable toxicity. Median duration of treatment was 4.5 months.



 Ten patients (8%) discontinued study treatment from adverse reactions due to (1 patient each) abdominal pain, arterial thrombosis, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased, blood creatinine increased, chronic kidney disease, diarrhea, ECG QT prolonged, fatigue, hip fracture, and lymphopenia. Forty-nine percent of patients had dose reductions due to an adverse reaction. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to dose reductions were diarrhea (20%), neutropenia (11%), and fatigue (9%).



 Deaths during treatment or during the 30-day follow up were reported in 2% of patients. Cause of death in these patients was due to infection.



 The most common reported adverse reactions (&gt;=20%) were diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, neutropenia, vomiting, infections, anemia, headache, and thrombocytopenia (  Table 10  ). Severe (Grade 3 and 4) neutropenia was observed in patients receiving abemaciclib  [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  )]  .

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Diarrhea: Instruct patients at the first sign of loose stools to initiate antidiarrheal therapy, increase oral fluids, and notify their healthcare provider. (  5.1  ) 
 *  Neutropenia: Monitor complete blood counts prior to the start of VERZENIO therapy, every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, monthly for the next 2 months, and as clinically indicated. (  2.2  ,  5.2  ) 
 *  Hepatotoxicity: Increases in serum transaminase levels have been observed. Perform liver function tests (LFTs) before initiating treatment with VERZENIO. Monitor LFTs every two weeks for the first two months, monthly for the next 2 months, and as clinically indicated. (  2.2  ,  5.3  ) 
 *  Venous Thromboembolism: Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and treat as medically appropriate. (  5.4  ) 
 *  Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. (  5.5  ,  8.1  ,  8.3  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Diarrhea



     Diarrhea occurred in 81% of patients receiving VERZENIO plus an aromatase inhibitor in MONARCH 3, 86% of patients receiving VERZENIO plus fulvestrant in MONARCH 2, and 90% of patients receiving VERZENIO alone in MONARCH 1. Grade 3 diarrhea occurred in 9% of patients receiving VERZENIO plus an aromatase inhibitor in MONARCH 3, 13% of patients receiving VERZENIO plus fulvestrant in MONARCH 2, and in 20% of patients receiving VERZENIO alone in MONARCH 1. Episodes of diarrhea have been associated with dehydration and infection.



    Diarrhea incidence was greatest during the first month of VERZENIO dosing. In MONARCH 3, the median time to onset of the first diarrhea event was 8 days, and the median duration of diarrhea for Grades 2 and 3 were 11 and 8 days, respectively. In MONARCH 2, the median time to onset of the first diarrhea event was 6 days, and the median duration of diarrhea for Grades 2 and 3 were 9 days and 6 days, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  ) and Patient Counseling Information (  17  )]  . In MONARCH 3, 19% of patients with diarrhea required a dose omission and 13% required a dose reduction. In MONARCH 2, 22% of patients with diarrhea required a dose omission and 22% required a dose reduction. The time to onset and resolution for diarrhea were similar across MONARCH 3, MONARCH 2, and MONARCH 1.



 Instruct patients that at the first sign of loose stools, they should start antidiarrheal therapy such as loperamide, increase oral fluids, and notify their healthcare provider for further instructions and appropriate follow up. For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, or diarrhea that requires hospitalization, discontinue VERZENIO until toxicity resolves to &lt;=Grade 1, and then resume VERZENIO at the next lower dose [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  )]  .



    5.2 Neutropenia



     Neutropenia occurred in 41% of patients receiving VERZENIO plus an aromatase inhibitor in MONARCH 3, 46% of patients receiving VERZENIO plus fulvestrant in MONARCH 2, and 37% of patients receiving VERZENIO alone in MONARCH 1. A Grade &gt;=3 decrease in neutrophil count (based on laboratory findings) occurred in 22% of patients receiving VERZENIO plus an aromatase inhibitor in MONARCH 3, 32% of patients receiving VERZENIO plus fulvestrant in MONARCH 2, and in 27% of patients receiving VERZENIO in MONARCH 1. In MONARCH 3, the median time to first episode of Grade &gt;=3 neutropenia was 33 days, and in MONARCH 2 and MONARCH 1 was 29 days. In MONARCH 3, median duration of Grade &gt;=3 neutropenia was 11 days, and for MONARCH 2 and MONARCH 1 was 15 days [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  .



 Monitor complete blood counts prior to the start of VERZENIO therapy, every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, monthly for the next 2 months, and as clinically indicated. Dose interruption, dose reduction, or delay in starting treatment cycles is recommended for patients who develop Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  )]  .



    Febrile neutropenia has been reported in &lt;1% of patients exposed to VERZENIO in the MONARCH studies. Two deaths due to neutropenic sepsis were observed in MONARCH 2. Inform patients to promptly report any episodes of fever to their healthcare provider [see Patient Counseling Information (  17  )]  .



    5.3 Hepatotoxicity



     In MONARCH 3, Grade &gt;=3 increases in ALT (6% versus 2%) and AST (3% versus 1%) were reported in the VERZENIO and placebo arms, respectively. In MONARCH 2, Grade &gt;=3 increases in ALT (4% versus 2%) and AST (2% versus 3%) were reported in the VERZENIO and placebo arms, respectively.



    In MONARCH 3, for patients receiving VERZENIO plus an aromatase inhibitor with Grade &gt;=3 ALT increased, median time to onset was 61 days, and median time to resolution to Grade &lt;3 was 14 days. In MONARCH 2, for patients receiving VERZENIO plus fulvestrant with Grade &gt;=3 ALT increased, median time to onset was 57 days, and median time to resolution to Grade &lt;3 was 14 days. In MONARCH 3, for patients receiving VERZENIO plus an aromatase inhibitor with Grade &gt;=3 AST increased, median time to onset was 71 days, and median time to resolution was 15 days. In MONARCH 2, for patients receiving VERZENIO plus fulvestrant with Grade &gt;=3 AST increased, median time to onset was 185 days, and median time to resolution was 13 days.



 Monitor liver function tests (LFTs) prior to the start of VERZENIO therapy, every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, monthly for the next 2 months, and as clinically indicated. Dose interruption, dose reduction, dose discontinuation, or delay in starting treatment cycles is recommended for patients who develop persistent or recurrent Grade 2, or Grade 3 or 4, hepatic transaminase elevation [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  )]  .



    5.4 Venous Thromboembolism



     In MONARCH 3, venous thromboembolic events were reported in 5% of patients treated with VERZENIO plus an aromatase inhibitor as compared to 0.6% of patients treated with an aromatase inhibitor plus placebo. In MONARCH 2, venous thromboembolic events were reported in 5% of patients treated with VERZENIO plus fulvestrant as compared to 0.9% of patients treated with fulvestrant plus placebo. Venous thromboembolic events included deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, pelvic venous thrombosis, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, subclavian and axillary vein thrombosis, and inferior vena cava thrombosis. Across the clinical development program, deaths due to venous thromboembolism have been reported.



    Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and treat as medically appropriate.



    5.5 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  Based on findings from animal studies and the mechanism of action, VERZENIO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of abemaciclib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused teratogenicity and decreased fetal weight at maternal exposures that were similar to the human clinical exposure based on area under the curve (AUC) at the maximum recommended human dose.



 Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with VERZENIO and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  ,  8.3  ) and Clinical Pharmacology (  12.1  )]  .
