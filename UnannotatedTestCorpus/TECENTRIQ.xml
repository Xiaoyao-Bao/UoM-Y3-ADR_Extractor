  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The data described in the  Warnings and Precautions section  reflect exposure to TECENTRIQ in 2616 patients in two randomized, active-controlled studies (POPLAR, OAK) and four open-label, single arm studies (PCD4989g, IMvigor210, BIRCH, FIR) which enrolled 524 patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma, 1636 patients with metastatic NSCLC, and 456 patients with other tumor types. TECENTRIQ was administered at a dose of 1200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks in all studies except PCD4989g. Among the 2616 patients, 36% were exposed for longer than 6 months and 20% were exposed for longer than 12 months.



 The data described in this section were obtained from one open-label, single arm, multiple cohort study (IMvigor210) and one randomized open-label, active-controlled study (OAK) in which TECENTRIQ was administered to 429 patients with locally advanced and metastatic urothelial carcinoma and 609 patients with metastatic NSCLC. In these trials, TECENTRIQ was administered at a dose of 1200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks.



     Cisplatin-Ineligible Patients with Locally Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma  



 The safety of TECENTRIQ was evaluated in IMvigor 210 (Cohort 1), a multicenter, open-label, single-arm trial that included 119 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who were ineligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy and were either previously untreated or had disease progression at least 12 months after neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy  [see  Clinical Studies (14.1)  ]  . Patients received TECENTRIQ 1200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks until either unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. The median duration of exposure was 15 weeks (0 to 87 weeks).



 The most common adverse reactions (&gt;= 20%) were fatigue (52%), decreased appetite (24%), diarrhea (24%), and nausea (22%). The most common Grade 3-4 adverse reactions (&gt;= 2%) were fatigue, urinary tract infection, anemia, diarrhea, blood creatinine increase, intestinal obstruction, ALT increase, hyponatremia, decreased appetite, sepsis, back/neck pain, renal failure, and hypotension.



 Five patients (4.2%) who were treated with TECENTRIQ experienced one of the following events which led to death: sepsis, cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, respiratory failure, or respiratory distress. One additional patient (0.8%) was experiencing herpetic meningoencephalitis and disease progression at the time of death. TECENTRIQ was discontinued for adverse reactions in 4.2% of patients. The adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were diarrhea/colitis (1.7%), fatigue (0.8%), hypersensitivity (0.8%), and dyspnea (0.8%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption occurred in 35% of patients; the most common (&gt;= 1%) were intestinal obstruction, fatigue, diarrhea, urinary tract infection, infusion- related reaction, cough, abdominal pain, peripheral edema, pyrexia, respiratory tract infection, upper respiratory tract infection, creatinine increase, decreased appetite, hyponatremia, back pain, pruritus, and venous thromboembolism. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 37% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions (&gt;= 2%) were diarrhea, intestinal obstruction, sepsis, acute kidney injury, and renal failure.



   Table 2  summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred in &gt;= 10% of patients and  Table 3  summarizes Grade 3-4 selected laboratory abnormalities that occurred in &gt;= 1% of patients treated with TECENTRIQ in IMvigor210 (Cohort 1).

            Previously Treated Patients with Locally Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma  
 

 The safety of TECENTRIQ was evaluated in IMvigor210 (Cohort 2), a multicenter, open-label, single-arm trial that included 310 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who had disease progression during or following at least one platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen or who had disease progression within 12 months of treatment with a platinum-containing neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy regimen  [see  Clinical Studies (14.1)  ]  . Patients received TECENTRIQ 1200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or either radiographic or clinical progression. The median duration of exposure was 12.3 weeks (0.1 to 46 weeks).



 The most common adverse reactions (&gt;= 20%) were fatigue (52%), decreased appetite (26%), nausea (25%), urinary tract infection (22%), pyrexia (21%), and constipation (21%). The most common Grade 3-4 adverse reactions (&gt;= 2%) were urinary tract infection, anemia, fatigue, dehydration, intestinal obstruction, urinary obstruction, hematuria, dyspnea, acute kidney injury, abdominal pain, venous thromboembolism, sepsis, and pneumonia.



 Three patients (1%) who were treated with TECENTRIQ experienced one of the following events which led to death: sepsis, pneumonitis, or intestinal obstruction. TECENTRIQ was discontinued for adverse reactions in 3.2% (10/310) of patients. Sepsis led to discontinuation in 0.6% (2/310) of patients. Adverse reactions leading to interruption occurred in 27% of patients; the most common (&gt; 1%) were liver enzyme increase, urinary tract infection, diarrhea, fatigue, confusional state, urinary obstruction, pyrexia, dyspnea, venous thromboembolism, and pneumonitis. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 45% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions (&gt; 2%) were urinary tract infection, hematuria, acute kidney injury, intestinal obstruction, pyrexia, venous thromboembolism, urinary obstruction, pneumonia, dyspnea, abdominal pain, sepsis, and confusional state.

            NSCLC  
 

 The safety of TECENTRIQ was evaluated in OAK, a multicenter, international, randomized, open-label trial in patients with metastatic NSCLC who progressed during or following a platinum-containing regimen, regardless of PD-L1 expression  [see  Clinical Studies (14.2)  ]  . A total of 609 patients received TECENTRIQ 1200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks weeks until unacceptable toxicity, radiographic progression, or clinical progression or docetaxel (n=578) 75 mg/m  2  intravenously every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. The study excluded patients with active or prior autoimmune disease or with medical conditions that required systemic corticosteroids. The study population characteristics were: median age of 63 years (25 to 85 years), 46% age 65 years or older, 62% male, 71% White, 20% Asian, 68% former smoker, 16% current smoker, and 63% had ECOG performance status of 1. The median duration of exposure was 3.4 months (0 to 26 months) in TECENTRIQ-treated patients and 2.1 months (0 to 23 months) in docetaxel-treated patients.



 The most common adverse reactions (&gt;= 20%) in patients receiving TECENTRIQ were fatigue (43.5%), decreased appetite (23.5%), dyspnea (22%), and cough (26.4%). The most common Grade 3-4 adverse reactions (&gt;= 2%) were dyspnea, pneumonia, fatigue, anemia, and pulmonary embolism.



 TECENTRIQ was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 8% of patients. The most common adverse reactions leading to TECENTRIQ discontinuation were fatigue, infections and dyspnea. Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 1.6% of patients; these included pneumonia, sepsis, septic shock, dyspnea, pulmonary hemorrhage, sudden death, myocardial ischemia or renal failure. Adverse reactions leading to interruption of TECENTRIQ occurred in 25% of patients; the most common (&gt; 1%) were pneumonia, liver function test abnormality, dyspnea, fatigue, pyrexia, and back pain. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 33.5% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions (&gt; 1%) were pneumonia, sepsis, dyspnea, pleural effusion, pulmonary embolism, pyrexia and respiratory tract infection.



   Table 6  summarizes adverse reactions that occurred in at least 10% of patients treated with TECENTRIQ.  Table 7  summarizes selected laboratory abnormalities worsening from baseline that occurred in &gt;= 20% of patients treated with TECENTRIQ.

             6.2 Immunogenicity
   As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity.



 Among 565 patients with NSCLC in OAK, 30% tested positive for treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies (ADA) at one or more post-dose time points. The median onset time to ADA formation was 3 weeks. The ability of these binding ADA to neutralize atezolizumab is unknown. Patients who tested positive for treatment-emergent ADA also had decreased systemic atezolizumab exposure  [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  . Exploratory analyses showed that the subset of patients who were ADA positive by week 4 (21%; 118/560) appeared to have less efficacy (effect on overall survival) as compared to patients who tested negative for treatment-emergent ADA by week 4  [see  Clinical Studies (14.2)  ].  The presence of ADA did not have a clinically significant effect on the incidence or severity of adverse reactions.



 Among 275 patients with urothelial carcinoma in IMvigor210 (Cohort 2), 42% tested positive for treatment-emergent ADA at one or more post-dose time points. Among 111 patients in IMvigor210 (Cohort 1), 48% tested positive for treatment-emergent ADA at one or more post-dose time points. Patients who tested positive for treatment-emergent ADA also had decreased systemic atezolizumab exposures. The presence of ADA did not have a clinically significant effect on the incidence or severity of adverse reactions.



 The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to atezolizumab in the studies described above with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading.

   5.1 Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis



   TECENTRIQ can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease, defined as requiring use of corticosteroids, including fatal cases. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate patients with suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids, prednisone 1-2 mg/kg/day or equivalents, followed by a taper for Grade 2 or higher pneumonitis. Withhold or permanently discontinue TECENTRIQ based on the severity [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ].    



  In clinical studies enrolling 2616 patients with various cancers who received TECENTRIQ [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  , pneumonitis occurred in 2.5% of patients, including Grade 3 (0.6%), Grade 4 (0.1%), and Grade 5 (&lt; 0.1%) immune-mediated pneumonitis. The median time to onset of pneumonitis was 3.6 months (3 days to 20.5 months) and median duration of pneumonitis was 1.4 months (1 day to 15.1 months). Pneumonitis resolved in 67% of patients. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of TECENTRIQ in 0.4% of the 2616 patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 1.5% of patients, including 0.8% who received high-dose corticosteroids (prednisone &gt;= 40 mg per day or equivalent) for a median duration of 4 days (1 day to 45 days) followed by a corticosteroid taper.  



    5.2 Immune-Mediated Hepatitis



   TECENTRIQ can cause liver test abnormalities and immune-mediated hepatitis, defined as requiring use of corticosteroids. Fatal cases have been reported. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hepatitis, during and after discontinuation of TECENTRIQ, including clinical chemistry monitoring. Administer corticosteroids, prednisone 1-2 mg/kg/day or equivalents, followed by a taper for Grade 2 or higher elevations of ALT, AST and/or total bilirubin. Interrupt or permanently discontinue TECENTRIQ based on the severity [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ].    



  In clinical studies enrolling 2616 patients with various cancers who received TECENTRIQ [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ],  hepatitis occurred in 9% of patients, including Grade 3 (2.3%), Grade 4 (0.6%), and Grade 5 (&lt; 0.1%). The median time to onset of hepatitis was 1.4 months (1 day to 25.8 months) and median duration was 24 days (1 day to 13 months). Hepatitis resolved in 71% of patients. Hepatitis led to discontinuation of TECENTRIQ in 0.4% of 2616 patients. Systemic corticosteroids was required in 2% of the patients, with 1.3% requiring high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 3 days (1 day to 35 days) followed by a corticosteroid taper.  



    5.3 Immune-Mediated Colitis



   TECENTRIQ can cause immune-mediated colitis or diarrhea, defined as requiring use of corticosteroids. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of diarrhea or colitis. Withhold treatment with TECENTRIQ for Grade 2 or 3 diarrhea or colitis. If symptoms persist for longer than 5 days or recur, administer corticosteroids, prednisone 1-2 mg/kg/day or equivalents, followed by a taper for Grade 2 diarrhea or colitis. Interrupt or permanently discontinue TECENTRIQ based on the severity [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].    



  In clinical studies enrolling 2616 patients with various cancers who received TECENTRIQ [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ],  diarrhea or colitis occurred in 20%, including Grade 3 (1.4%) events. The median time to onset of diarrhea or colitis was 1.5 months (1 day to 41 months). Diarrhea and colitis resolved in 85% of the patients. Diarrhea or colitis led to discontinuation of TECENTRIQ in 0.2% of 2616 patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 1.1% of patients and high-dose corticosteroids was required in 0.4% patients with a median duration of 3 days (1 day to 11 days).  



    5.4 Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies



  TECENTRIQ can cause immune-mediated endocrinopathies, including thyroid disorders, adrenal insufficiency, and type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, and hypophysitis/hypopituitarism.



    Thyroid Disorders:  Monitor thyroid function prior to and periodically during treatment with TECENTRIQ. Initiate hormone replacement therapy or medical management of hyperthyroidism as clinically indicated. Continue TECENTRIQ for hypothyroidism and interrupt for hyperthyroidism based on the severity [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ].  



  In clinical studies enrolling 2616 patients who received TECENTRIQ [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  , hypothyroidism occurred in 4.6% of patients, and 3.8% of patients required the use of hormone replacement therapy. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 1.6% of patients. One patient was noted to have acute thyroiditis.  



    Adrenal Insufficiency  : Monitor patients for clinical signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher adrenal insufficiency, initiate prednisone 1 to 2 mg/kg/day or equivalents, followed by a taper and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Interrupt TECENTRIQ based on the severity [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ].  



  In clinical studies enrolling 2616 patients who received TECENTRIQ, adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.4% of patients, including Grade 3 (&lt; 0.1%) adrenal insufficiency. Median time to onset was 5.7 months (3 days to 19 months). There was insufficient information to adequately characterize the median duration of adrenal insufficiency. Adrenal insufficiency resolved in 27% of patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 0.3% of 2616 patients, including 0.1% who required high-dose corticosteroids.  



    Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus  : Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Initiate treatment with insulin as clinically indicated. Interrupt TECENTRIQ based on the severity [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ].  



  In clinical studies enrolling 2616 patients who received TECENTRIQ, type 1 diabetes mellitus occurred in &lt; 0.1% of patients. Insulin was required in one patient.  



    Hypophysitis:  For Grade 2 or higher hypophysitis, initiate prednisone 1-2 mg/kg/day or equivalents, followed by a taper and hormone replacement therapy as clinically indicated. Interrupt TECENTRIQ based on the severity [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .



  In clinical studies enrolling 2616 patients who received TECENTRIQ, Grade 2 hypophysitis occurred in &lt; 0.1% of patients.  



    5.5 Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions



  TECENTRIQ can cause severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions. These immune-mediated reactions may involve any organ system. While immune-mediated reactions usually manifest during treatment with TECENTRIQ, immune-mediated adverse reactions can also manifest after discontinuation of TECENTRIQ.



  For suspected Grade 2 immune-mediated adverse reactions, exclude other causes and initiate corticosteroids as clinically indicated. For severe (Grade 3 or 4) adverse reactions, administer corticosteroids, prednisone 1 to 2 mg/kg/day or equivalents, followed by a taper. Interrupt or permanently discontinue TECENTRIQ, based on the severity of the reaction [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ].    



  If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, evaluate for Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome, which has been observed with other products in this class and may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss.  



 The following clinically significant, immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of &lt; 1% in 2616 patients who received TECENTRIQ or were reported in other products in this class [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  :



  Cardiac:  myocarditis



  Dermatologic:  bullous dermatitis, pemphigoid, erythema multiforme, Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).



  Gastrointestinal:  pancreatitis, including increases in serum amylase or lipase levels



  General:  systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis



   Hematological:  autoimmune hemolytic anemia, immune thrombocytopenic purpura.  



   Musculoskeletal:  myositis, rhabdomyolysis.  



   Neurological  : Guillain-Barre syndrome, myasthenia syndrome/myasthenia gravis, demyelination, immune-related meningoencephalitis, aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, facial and abducens nerve paresis, polymyalgia rheumatica, autoimmune neuropathy, and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome.  



   Ophthalmological:  uveitis, iritis.  



   Renal:  nephrotic syndrome, nephritis.  



   Vascular:  vasculitis  



    5.6 Infections



  TECENTRIQ can cause severe infections including fatal cases. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection. For Grade 3 or higher infections, withhold TECENTRIQ and resume once clinically stable [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



  In clinical studies enrolling 2616 patients with various cancers who received TECENTRIQ [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  , infections occurred in 42% of patients, including Grade 3 (8.7%), Grade 4 (1.5%), and Grade 5 (1%). In patients with urothelial carcinoma, the most common Grade 3 or higher infection was urinary tract infections, occurring in 6.5% of patients. In patients with NSCLC, the most common Grade 3 or higher infection was pneumonia, occurring in 3.8% of patients.  



    5.7 Infusion-Related Reactions



   TECENTRIQ can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt, slow the rate of, or permanently discontinue TECENTRIQ based on the severity [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  . For Grade 1 or 2 infusion-related reactions, consider using pre-medications with subsequent doses.  



  In clinical studies enrolling 2616 patients with various cancers who received TECENTRIQ [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  , infusion-related reactions occurred in 1.3% of patients, including Grade 3 (0.2%).  



    5.8 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  Based on its mechanism of action, TECENTRIQ can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data on the use of TECENTRIQ in pregnant women. Animal studies have demonstrated that inhibition of the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway can lead to increased risk of immune-related rejection of the developing fetus resulting in fetal death.



 Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating TECENTRIQ. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TECENTRIQ and for at least 5 months after the last dose [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1  ,  8.3)  ].
