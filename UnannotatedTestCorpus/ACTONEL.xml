    Actonel  



   Osteoporosis:  



 Actonel has been studied in over 5700 patients enrolled in the Phase 3 glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis clinical trials and in postmenopausal osteoporosis trials of up to 3-years duration. The overall adverse event profile of Actonel 5 mg in these studies was similar to that of placebo. Most adverse events were either mild or moderate and did not lead to discontinuation from the study. The incidence of serious adverse events in the placebo group was 24.9% and in the Actonel 5 mg group was 26.3%. The percentage of patients who withdrew from the study due to adverse events was 14.4% and 13.5% for the placebo and Actonel 5 mg groups, respectively.  Table 4  lists adverse events from the Phase 3 osteoporosis trials reported in greater than or equal to 2% of patients and in more Actonel-treated patients than placebo-treated patients. Adverse events are shown without attribution of causality.

         Duodenitis and glossitis have been reported uncommonly (0.1% to 1%). There have been rare reports (less than 0.1%) of abnormal liver function tests.
 

 Laboratory Test Findings:



 Asymptomatic and small decreases were observed in serum calcium and phosphorus levels. Overall, mean decreases of 0.8% in serum calcium and of 2.7% in phosphorus were observed at 6 months in patients receiving Actonel. Throughout the Phase 3 studies, serum calcium levels below 8 mg/dL were observed in 18 patients, 9 (0.5%) in each treatment arm (Actonel and placebo). Serum phosphorus levels below 2 mg/dL were observed in 14 patients, 11 (0.6%) treated with Actonel and 3 (0.2%) treated with placebo.



 Endoscopic Findings:



 Actonel clinical studies enrolled over 5700 patients, many with pre-existing gastrointestinal disease and concomitant use of NSAIDs or aspirin. Investigators were encouraged to perform endoscopies in any patients with moderate-to-severe gastrointestinal complaints, while maintaining the blind. These endoscopies were ultimately performed on equal numbers of patients between the treated and placebo groups [75 (14.5%) placebo; 75 (11.9%) Actonel]. Across treatment groups, the percentage of patients with normal esophageal, gastric, and duodenal mucosa on endoscopy was similar (20% placebo; 21% Actonel). The number of patients who withdrew from the studies due to the event prompting endoscopy was similar across treatment groups. Positive findings on endoscopy were also generally comparable across treatment groups. There was a higher number of reports of mild duodenitis in the Actonel group, however there were more duodenal ulcers in the placebo group. Clinically important findings (perforations, ulcers, or bleeding) among this symptomatic population were similar between groups (51% placebo; 39% Actonel).



 Once-a-week Dosing:



 In a 1-year, double-blind, multicenter study comparing Actonel 5 mg daily and Actonel 35 mg once-a-week in postmenopausal women, the overall safety and tolerability profiles of the 2 oral dosing regimens were similar.  Table 5  lists the adverse events in greater than or equal to 2% of patients from this trial. Events are shown without attribution of causality.

         Osteoporosis Prevention:
 

 There were no deaths in a 1-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of Actonel 35 mg once-a-week for prevention of bone loss in 278 postmenopausal women without osteoporosis. More treated subjects on risedronate experienced arthralgia (risedronate 13.9%; placebo 7.8%), myalgia (risedronate 5.1%; placebo 2.1%), and nausea (risedronate 7.3%; placebo 4.3%) than subjects on placebo.



   Post-marketing Experience:  



 Hypersensitivity and skin reactions have been reported, including angioedema, generalized rash and bullous skin reactions, some severe.



 Musculoskeletal: bone, joint, or muscle pain, occasionally described as severe or incapacitating (see    PRECAUTIONS, Musculoskeletal Pain    ).



 Pulmonary: Asthma exacerbations



 Reactions of eye inflammation including iritis and uveitis have been reported. Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported (see    PRECAUTIONS, General    ).



   Calcium  



 Calcium carbonate may cause gastrointestinal adverse effects such as constipation, flatulence, nausea, abdominal pain, and bloating. Administration of calcium may increase the risk of kidney stones, particularly in patients with a history of this condition (see    PRECAUTIONS    ).
</Section>
    <Section id="S2" name="precautions">    PRECAUTIONS



   General:



   Actonel  



 Hypocalcemia and Mineral Metabolism:



 Hypocalcemia and other disturbances of bone and mineral metabolism should be effectively treated before starting Actonel therapy. Adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D is important in all patients. Actonel is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min).



 Upper Gastointestinal Adverse Reactions:



 Actonel, like other bisphosphonates administered orally, may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. Because of these possible irritant effects and a potential for worsening of the underlying disease, caution should be used when Actonel is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems (such as known Barrett's esophagus, dysphagia, other esophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis or ulcers) [see   Adverse Reactions    ].



 Esophageal adverse experiences, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcers and esophageal erosions, occasionally with bleeding and rarely followed by esophageal stricture or perforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates. In some cases, these have been severe and required hospitalization. Physicians should therefore be alert to any signs or symptoms signaling a possible esophageal reaction and patients should be instructed to discontinue Actonel and seek medical attention if they develop dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn.



 The risk of severe esophageal adverse experiences appears to be greater in patients who lie down after taking oral bisphosphonates and/or who fail to swallow it with the recommended full glass (6 to 8 ounces) of water, and/or who continue to take oral bisphosphonates after developing symptoms suggestive of esophageal irritation. Therefore, it is very important that the full dosing instructions are provided to, and understood by, the patient [see   Dosage and Administration    ]. In patients who cannot comply with dosing instructions due to mental disability, therapy with Actonel should be used under appropriate supervision.



 There have been post-marketing reports of gastric and duodenal ulcers with oral bisphosphonate use, some severe and with complications, although no increased risk was observed in controlled clinical trials.



 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw:



 Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), which can occur spontaneously, is generally associated with tooth extraction and/or local infection with delayed healing, and has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including Actonel. Known risk factors for osteonecrosis of the jaw include invasive dental procedures (for example, tooth extraction, dental implants, boney surgery), diagnosis of cancer, concomitant therapies (for example, chemotherapy, corticosteroids), poor oral hygiene, and co-morbid disorders (for example, periodontal and/or other pre-existing dental disease, anemia, coagulopathy, infection, ill-fitting dentures). The risk of ONJ may increase with duration of exposure to bisphosphonates.



 For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment may reduce the risk for ONJ. Clinical judgement of the treating physician and/or oral surgeon should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment.



 Patients who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw while on bisphosphonate therapy should receive care by an oral surgeon. In these patients, extensive dental surgery to treat ONJ may exacerbate the condition. Discontinuation of bisphosphonate therapy should be considered based on individual benefit/risk assessment.



 Musculoskeletal Pain:



 In postmarketing experience, there have been infrequent reports of severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain in patients taking bisphosphonates (see   ADVERSE REACTIONS    ). The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping medication. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate.



 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures:



 Atypical, low-energy, or low trauma fractures of the femoral shaft have been reported in bisphosphonate-treated patients. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are traverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. Causality has not been established as these fractures also occur in osteoporotic patients who have not been treated with bisphosphonates.



 Atypical femur fractures most commonly occur with minimal or no trauma to the affected area. They may be bilateral and many patients report prodromal pain in the affected area, usually presenting as dull, aching thigh pain, weeks to months before a complete fracture occurs. A number of reports note that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (for example, prednisone) at the time of fracture.



 Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. Patients presenting with an atypical fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral limb. Interruption of bisphosphonate therapy should be considered, pending a risk/benefit assessment, on an individual basis.



  CALCIUM  



 Actonel with Calcium should not be used to treat hypocalcemia. Total daily intake of calcium above 1500 mg has not demonstrated additional bone benefits while daily intake above 2000 mg has been associated with increased risk of adverse effects, including hypercalcemia and kidney stones.



 Administration of calcium has been associated with a slight increase in the risk of kidney stones.



 In patients with a history of kidney stones or hypercalciuria, metabolic assessment to seek treatable causes of these conditions is warranted. If administration of calcium tablets should be needed in these patients, urinary calcium excretion and other appropriate testing should be monitored periodically.



 Patients with achlorhydria may have decreased absorption of calcium. Taking calcium with food enhances absorption.



 Concomitant use of calcium-containing antacids should be monitored to avoid excessive intake of calcium.



    Information for Patients:



   Actonel  



 The patient should be informed to pay particular attention to the dosing instructions as clinical benefits may be compromised by failure to take the drug according to instructions. Specifically, Actonel should be taken at least 30 minutes before the first food or drink of the day other than water.



 To facilitate delivery to the stomach, and thus reduce the potential for esophageal irritation, patients should take Actonel while in an upright position (sitting or standing) with a full glass of plain water (6 to 8 ounces). Patients should not lie down for 30 minutes after taking the medication (see   PRECAUTIONS, General    ). Patients should not chew or suck on the tablet because of a potential for oropharyngeal irritation.



 Patients should be instructed that if they develop symptoms of esophageal disease (such as difficulty or pain upon swallowing, retrosternal pain or severe persistent or worsening heartburn) they should consult their physician before continuing Actonel.



 Patients should be instructed that if they miss a dose of Actonel 35 mg once-a-week, they should take 1 tablet on the morning after they remember and return to taking 1 tablet once-a-week, as originally scheduled on their chosen day. Patients should not take 2 tablets on the same day.



 Patients should receive supplemental calcium and vitamin D if dietary intake is inadequate (see   PRECAUTIONS, General    ). Calcium supplements or calcium-, aluminum-, and magnesium-containing medications may interfere with the absorption of Actonel and should be taken at a different time of the day, as with food.



 Weight-bearing exercise should be considered along with the modification of certain behavioral factors, such as excessive cigarette smoking, and/or alcohol consumption, if these factors exist.



 Physicians should instruct their patients to read the Patient Information before starting therapy with Actonel 35 mg and to re-read it each time the prescription is renewed.



 Patients should be reminded to give all of their healthcare providers an accurate medication history. Instruct patients to tell all of their healthcare providers that they are taking Actonel. Patients should be instructed that any time they have a medical problem they think may be from Actonel, they should talk to their doctor.



  Calcium  



 Calcium should be used as an adjunct to osteoporosis therapies.



 The patient should be informed to take the calcium tablets with food to facilitate calcium absorption.



    Drug Interactions:



   Actonel  



 No specific drug-drug interaction studies were performed. Risedronate is not metabolized and does not induce or inhibit hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing enzymes (Cytochrome P450).



 Calcium Supplements/Antacids:



 Co-administration of Actonel and calcium, antacids, or oral medications containing divalent cations will interfere with the absorption of Actonel.



 Hormone Replacement Therapy:



 One study of about 500 early postmenopausal women has been conducted to date in which treatment with Actonel (5 mg/day) plus estrogen replacement therapy was compared to estrogen replacement therapy alone. Exposure to study drugs was approximately 12 to 18 months and the primary endpoint was change in BMD. If considered appropriate, Actonel may be used concomitantly with hormone replacement therapy.



 Aspirin/Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs):



 Of over 5700 patients enrolled in the Actonel Phase 3 osteoporosis studies, aspirin use was reported by 31% of patients, 24% of whom were regular users (3 or more days per week). Forty-eight percent of patients reported NSAID use, 21% of whom were regular users. Among regular aspirin or NSAID users, the incidence of upper gastrointestinal adverse experiences in Actonel-treated patients (24.5%) was similar to that in placebo-treated patients (24.8%).



 H2Blockers and Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs):



 Of over 5700 patients enrolled in the Actonel Phase 3 osteoporosis studies, 21% used H2blockers and/or PPIs. Among these patients, the incidence of upper gastrointestinal adverse experiences in the Actonel-treated patients was similar to that in placebo-treated patients.



  Calcium  



 Bisphosphonates:



 Oral bisphosphonates (such as risedronate, alendronate, etidronate, ibandronate): Decreased absorption of the bisphosphonate may occur when the bisphosphonate and calcium are taken together.



 Thyroid hormones:



 Levothyroxine: Concomitant intake of levothyroxine and calcium carbonate was found to reduce levothyroxine absorption and increase serum thyrotropin levels.



 Fluoroquinolones:



 Fluoroquinolones (such as ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and ofloxacin): Concomitant administration of a fluoroquinolone and calcium carbonate may decrease the absorption of the fluoroquinolone.



 Systemic glucocorticoids:



 Calcium absorption is reduced when calcium carbonate is taken concomitantly with systemic glucocorticoids.



 Tetracyclines:



 Tetracyclines (such as doxycycline, minocycline, tetracycline): Concomitant administration of a tetracycline and calcium carbonate may decrease the absorption of the tetracycline.



 Thiazide diuretics:



 Reduced urinary excretion of calcium has been reported during concomitant use of calcium carbonate and thiazide diuretics.



 Vitamin D:



 Vitamin D and vitamin D analogues (such as calcitriol, doxercalciferol, and paricalcitol): Absorption of calcium may be increased when calcium carbonate is given concomitantly with vitamin D analogues.



 Iron:



 Calcium may interfere with the absorption of iron. Patients being treated for iron deficiency should take iron and calcium at different times of the day.



    Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions:



   Actonel  



 Bisphosphonates are known to interfere with the use of bone-imaging agents. Specific studies with Actonel have not been performed.



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:



  Carcinogenesis:



 In a 104-week carcinogenicity study, rats were administered daily oral doses of risedronate up to 24 mg/kg/day (approximately 50 times the systemic exposure following a 35 mg/week human dose based on surface area, mg/m  2  ). There were no significant drug-induced tumor findings in male or female rats. The high dose male group of 24 mg/kg/day was terminated early in the study (Week 93) due to excessive toxicity, and data from this group were not included in the statistical evaluation of the study results. In an 80-week carcinogenicity study, mice were administered daily oral doses up to 32 mg/kg/day (approximately 30 times the systemic exposure following a 35 mg/week human dose based on surface area, mg/m  2  ). There were no significant drug-induced tumor findings in male or female mice.



 Mutagenesis:



 Risedronate did not exhibit genetic toxicity in the following assays: In vitro  bacterial mutagenesis in Salmonella  and E. coli  (Ames assay), mammalian cell mutagenesis in CHO/HGPRT assay, unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat hepatocytes and an assessment of chromosomal aberrations in vivo  in rat bone marrow.



 Impairment of Fertility:



 In female rats, ovulation was inhibited at an oral dose of risedronate of 16 mg/kg/day (approximately 30 times the systemic exposure following a 35 mg/week human dose based on surface area, mg/m  2  ). Decreased implantation was noted in female rats treated with doses &gt;=7 mg/kg/day (14 times the systemic exposure following a 35 mg/week human dose based on surface area, mg/m  2  ). In male rats, testicular and epididymal atrophy and inflammation were noted at 40 mg/kg/day (80 times the systemic exposure following a 35 mg/week human dose based on surface area, mg/m  2  ). Testicular atrophy was also noted in male rats after 13 weeks of treatment at oral doses of 16 mg/kg/day (approximately 30 times the systemic exposure following a 35 mg/week human dose based on surface area, mg/m  2  ). There was moderate-to-severe spermatid maturation block after 13 weeks in male dogs at an oral dose of 8 mg/kg/day (approximately 50 times the systemic exposure following a 35 mg/week human dose based on surface area, mg/m  2  ).



    Pregnancy:



  Pregnancy Category C: Survival of neonates was decreased in rats treated during gestation with oral doses of risedronate greater than or equal to 16 mg/kg/day (approximately 30 times the systemic exposure following a 35 mg/week human dose based on surface area, mg/m  2  ). Body weight was decreased in neonates from dams treated with 80 mg/kg (approximately 160 times the 35 mg/week human dose based on surface area, mg/m  2  ). In rats treated during gestation, the number of fetuses exhibiting incomplete ossification of sternebrae or skull was statistically significantly increased at 7.1 mg/kg/day (approximately 14 times the 35 mg/week human dose based on surface area, mg/m  2  ). Both incomplete ossification and unossified sternebrae were increased in rats treated with oral doses greater than or equal to 16 mg/kg/day (approximately 30 times the 35 mg/week human dose based on surface area, mg/m  2  ). A low incidence of cleft palate was observed in fetuses from female rats treated with oral doses greater than or equal to 3.2 mg/kg/day (approximately 20 times the 35 mg/week human dose based on surface area, mg/m  2  ). The relevance of this finding to human use of Actonel is unclear. No significant fetal ossification effects were seen in rabbits treated with oral doses up to 10 mg/kg/day during gestation (40 times the 35 mg/week human dose based on surface area, mg/m  2  ). However, in rabbits treated with 10 mg/kg/day, 1 of 14 litters were aborted and 1 of 14 litters were delivered prematurely.



 Similar to other bisphosphonates, treatment during mating and gestation with doses as low as 3.2 mg/kg/day (approximately 20 times the 35 mg/week human dose based on surface area, mg/m  2  ) has resulted in periparturient hypocalcemia and mortality in pregnant rats allowed to deliver.



 Bisphosphonates are incorporated into the bone matrix, from which they are gradually released over periods of weeks to years. The amount of bisphosphonate incorporation into adult bone, and hence, the amount available for release back into the systemic circulation, is directly related to the dose and duration of bisphosphonate use. There are no data on fetal risk in humans. However, there is a theoretical risk of fetal harm, predominantly skeletal, if a woman becomes pregnant after completing a course of bisphosphonate therapy. The impact of variables such as time between cessation of bisphosphonate therapy to conception, the particular bisphosphonate used, and the route of administration (intravenous versus oral) on this risk has not been studied.



 There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Actonel in pregnant women. Actonel should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the mother and fetus.



    Nursing Women:



  Risedronate was detected in feeding pups exposed to lactating rats for a 24-hour period post-dosing, indicating a small degree of lacteal transfer. It is not known whether risedronate is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from bisphosphonates, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.



    Pediatric Use:



   Actonel  



 Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.



    Geriatric Use:



   Actonel  



 Of the patients receiving Actonel in postmenopausal osteoporosis studies (see   CLINICAL STUDIES    ), 47% were between 65 and 75 years of age, and 17% were over 75. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between these patients and younger patients but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.



  Calcium  



 There are no published data that specifically compare the efficacy and safety between postmenopausal women above and below the age of 65 years.



    Use in Men:



   Actonel  



 The safety and effectiveness in men for the treatment of primary osteoporosis have not been established.
