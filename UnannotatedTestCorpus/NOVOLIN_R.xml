  The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:



 *  1.  Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  )]  
 *  2.  Medication Errors [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.4  )]  
 *  3.  Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.5  )]  
 *  4.  Hypokalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.6  )]  
      Adverse Reactions from Clinical Studies or Postmarketing Reports  
 

 The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during clinical studies or from postmarketing reports with use of NOVOLIN R. Because some of these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Adverse reactions associated with insulin initiation and glucose control intensification  



 Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder, worsening of diabetic retinopathy, and acute painful peripheral neuropathy. Over the long-term, improved glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy.



   Hypersensitivity reactions  



 Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis.



   Hypoglycemia  



 Hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in NOVOLIN R.



   Hypokalemia  



 NOVOLIN R can cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia.



   Injection site reactions  



 NOVOLIN R can cause local injection site reactions including redness, swelling, or itching at the site of injection. These reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks, but in some occasions, may require discontinuation. Localized reactions and generalized myalgias have been reported with the use of metacresol, which is an excipient in NOVOLIN R.



   Lipodystrophy  



 Administration of insulin subcutaneously, including NOVOLIN R, has resulted in lipoatrophy (depression in the skin) or lipohypertrophy (enlargement or thickening of tissue)  [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]  in some patients.



   Medication Errors  



 Medication errors in which other insulins have been accidentally substituted for NOVOLIN R have been identified during postapproval use.



   Peripheral edema  



 Insulins, including NOVOLIN R, may cause sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy.



   Weight gain  



 Weight gain can occur with insulin therapies, including NOVOLIN R, and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria.



   Immunogenicity  



 As with all therapeutic peptides, insulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. Increases in titers of anti-insulin antibodies that react with human insulin have been observed in patients treated with NOVOLIN R.



   EXCERPT:   Adverse reactions observed with NOVOLIN R include hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, injection site reactions, lipodystrophy, weight gain and edema (  6  )  .

   5.1 Never Share a NOVOLIN R FlexPen or Syringe between Patients



  NOVOLIN R FlexPen must never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Patients using NOVOLIN R vials must never share needles or syringes with another person. Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens.



    5.2 Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen



  Changes in insulin strength, manufacturer, type, or method of administration may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  )]  or hyperglycemia. These changes should be made cautiously and under close medical supervision and the frequency of blood glucose monitoring should be increased. For patients with type 2 diabetes, dosage adjustments of concomitant anti-diabetic products may be needed.



    5.3 Hypoglycemia



  Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction of all insulins, including NOVOLIN R. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may lead to unconsciousness, may be life threatening or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place an individual and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g. driving or operating other machinery).



 Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over time in the same individual. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes in patients with diabetic nerve disease, in patients using medications that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers) [see Drug Interactions (  7  )]  , or in patients who experience recurrent hypoglycemia.



  Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia  



 The risk of hypoglycemia after an injection is related to the duration of action of the insulin and, in general, is highest when the glucose lowering effect of the insulin is maximal. As with all insulin preparations, the glucose lowering effect time course of NOVOLIN R may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature [see Clinical Pharmacology (  12.2  )].  Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to co-administered medication [see Drug Interactions (  7  )].  Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.6  ,  8.7  )].  



  Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia  



 Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended.



    5.4 Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors



  Accidental mix-ups between NOVOLIN R and other insulin products have been reported. To avoid medication errors between NOVOLIN R and other insulins, instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection.



    5.5 Hypersensitivity and Allergic Reactions



  Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with NOVOLIN R. Generalized allergy to insulin may manifest as a whole body rash (including pruritus), dyspnea, wheezing, hypotension ,  tachycardia, or diaphoresis. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue NOVOLIN R; treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve. NOVOLIN R is contraindicated in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to insulin human injection or its excipients [see Contraindications (  4  )].  



    5.6 Hypokalemia



  All insulins, including NOVOLIN R, cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia if indicated (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentration).



    5.7 Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of PPAR-gamma agonists



  Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including NOVOLIN R, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered.
