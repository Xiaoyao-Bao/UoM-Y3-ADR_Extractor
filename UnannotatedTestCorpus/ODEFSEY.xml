  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug (or a drug given in various combinations with other concomitant therapy) cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug (or drug given in the same or different combination therapy) and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials of ODEFSEY in Virologically-Suppressed Adult Subjects with HIV-1 Infection  



 The safety of ODEFSEY in virologically-suppressed adults is based on Week 48 data from two randomized, double-blinded, active-controlled clinical trials, 1160 and 1216, that enrolled 1505 adult subjects who were virologically-suppressed for at least 6 months. Both trials were designed to compare switching to ODEFSEY to maintaining efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (EFV/FTC/TDF) or emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/RPV/TDF) in Trials 1160 and 1216, respectively. A total of 754 subjects received one tablet of ODEFSEY daily  [see  Clinical Studies (14.1)  ].  



 The most common adverse reactions (all Grades) reported in at least 2% of subjects in the ODEFSEY group across Trials 1216 and 1160 were headache and sleep disturbances (Table 1). Over 98% of the adverse reactions in the ODEFSEY group were of mild to moderate intensity. The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment with ODEFSEY due to adverse events, regardless of severity, was 2% compared to 1% for FTC/RPV/TDF and 2% for EFV/FTC/TDF.

               Renal Laboratory Tests  
 

 In Trial 1216, the median baseline eGFR was104 mL per minute for subjects who switched to ODEFSEY from FTC/RPV/TDF (N=316) and the mean serum creatinine decreased by 0.02 mg per dL from baseline to Week 48.



 In Trial 1160, the median baseline eGFR was 110 mL per minute for subjects who switched to ODEFSEY from EFV/FTC/TDF (N=438), and the mean serum creatinine increased by 0.1 mg per dL from baseline to Week 48.



     Bone Mineral Density Effects  



 Changes in BMD from baseline to Week 48 were assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in Trials 1216 and 1160.



 In Trial 1216, mean bone mineral density (BMD) increased in subjects who switched to ODEFSEY (1.61% lumbar spine, 1.04% total hip) and remained stable or decreased in subjects who remained on FTC/RPV/TDF (0.08% lumbar spine, -0.25% total hip). BMD declines of 5% or greater at the lumbar spine were experienced by 1.7% of ODEFSEY subjects and 3.0% of FTC/RPV/TDF subjects. BMD declines of 7% or greater at the femoral neck were experienced by 0% of ODEFSEY subjects and 1.2% of FTC/RPV/TDF subjects.



 In Trial 1160, mean BMD increased in subjects who switched to ODEFSEY (1.65% lumbar spine, 1.28% total hip) and decreased slightly in subjects who remained on EFV/FTC/TDF (-0.05% lumbar spine, -0.13% total hip). BMD declines of 5% or greater at the lumbar spine were experienced by 2.3% of ODEFSEY subjects and 4.9% of EFV/FTC/TDF subjects. BMD declines of 7% or greater at the femoral neck were experienced by 1.4% of ODEFSEY subjects and 3.3% of EFV/FTC/TDF subjects. The long-term clinical significance of these BMD changes is not known.

                   Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials of RPV-Containing Regimens in Treatment-Naive Adult Subjects with HIV-1 Infection  
 

 In pooled 96-week trials of antiretroviral treatment-naive HIV-1 infected adult subjects, the most common adverse reactions in subjects treated with RPV+FTC/TDF (N=550) (incidence greater than or equal to 2%, Grades 2-4) were headache, depressive disorders, and insomnia. The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment with RPV+FTC/TDF due to adverse reactions, regardless of severity, was 2%. The most common adverse reactions that led to discontinuation in this treatment group were psychiatric disorders (1.6%) and rash (0.2%). Although the safety profile was similar in virologically-suppressed adults with HIV-1 infection who were switched to RPV and other antiretroviral drugs, the frequency of adverse events increased by 20% (N=317).



     Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials of FTC+TAF with EVG+COBI in Treatment-Naive Adult Subjects with HIV-1 Infection  



 In pooled 48-week trials of antiretroviral treatment-naive HIV-1 infected adult subjects, the most common adverse reaction in subjects treated with FTC+TAF with EVG+COBI (N=866) (incidence greater than or equal to 10%, all grades) was nausea (10%). In this treatment group, 0.9% of subjects discontinued FTC+TAF with EVG+COBI due to adverse event  [see  Clinical Studies (14)  ]  . Antiretroviral treatment-naive adult subjects treated with FTC+TAF with EVG+COBI experienced mean increases of 30 mg/dL of total cholesterol, 15 mg/dL of LDL cholesterol, 7 mg/dL of HDL cholesterol and 29 mg/dL of triglycerides after 48 weeks of use.



     Renal Laboratory Tests  



 In two 48-week trials in antiretroviral treatment-naive HIV-1 infected adults treated with FTC+TAF with EVG+COBI (N=866) with a median baseline eGFR of 115 mL per minute, mean serum creatinine increased by 0.1 mg per dL from baseline to Week 48. In a 24-week trial in adults with renal impairment (baseline eGFR 30 to 69 mL per minute) who received FTC+TAF with EVG+COBI (N=248), mean serum creatinine was 1.5 mg per dL at both baseline and Week 24.



     Bone Mineral Density Effects  



 In the pooled analysis of two 48-week trials of antiretroviral treatment-naive HIV-1 infected adult subjects, bone mineral density (BMD) from baseline to Week 48 was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Mean BMD decreased from baseline to Week 48 by -1.30% with FTC+TAF with EVG+COBI at the lumbar spine and -0.66% at the total hip. BMD declines of 5% or greater at the lumbar spine were experienced by 10% of FTC+TAF with EVG+COBI subjects. BMD declines of 7% or greater at the femoral neck were experienced by 7% of FTC+TAF with EVG+COBI subjects. The long-term clinical significance of these BMD changes is not known.



     Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials in Pediatric Subjects with HIV-1 Infection  



 In an open-label 48-week trial of 36 antiretroviral treatment-naive HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects 12 to less than 18 years old (weighing at least 32 kg) treated with 25 mg per day of RPV and other antiretrovirals, the most common adverse reactions were headache (19%), depression (19%), somnolence (14%), nausea (11%), dizziness (8%), abdominal pain (8%), vomiting (6%) and rash (6%).



 In a 24-week, open-label trial of 23 antiretroviral treatment-naive HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects aged 12 to less than 18 years old (weighing at least 35 kg) who received FTC+TAF with EVG+COBI, the safety of this combination was similar to that of adults. Among these pediatric subjects, mean BMD increased from baseline to Week 24, +1.7% at the lumbar spine and +0.8% for the total body less head. Mean changes from baseline BMD Z-scores were -0.10 for lumbar spine and -0.11 for total body less head at Week 24. Two subjects had significant (greater than 4%) lumbar spine BMD loss at Week 24.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing experience in patients receiving RPV-containing regimens. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders  



 Weight increased



   Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders  



 Severe skin and hypersensitivity reactions including DRESS (Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms)



   Renal and Urinary Disorders

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: POST TREATMENT ACUTE EXACERBATION OF HEPATITIS B

    WARNING: POST TREATMENT ACUTE EXACERBATION OF HEPATITIS B  

    Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV and have discontinued products containing emtricitabine (FTC) and/or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), and may occur with discontinuation of ODEFSEY.   



   Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV and discontinue ODEFSEY. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  .  



   EXCERPT:     WARNING: POST TREATMENT ACUTE EXACERBATION OF HEPATITIS B  



   See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.  



   Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV and have discontinued products containing emtricitabine (FTC) and/or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), and may occur with discontinuation of ODEFSEY. Hepatic function should be monitored closely in these patients. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted. (  5.1  )  



 
</Section>
    <Section id="S3" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Skin and Hypersensitivity Reactions: Severe skin and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported during postmarketing experience with RPV-containing regimens, including cases of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS). Immediately discontinue treatment if hypersensitivity or rash with systemic symptoms or elevations in hepatic serum biochemistries develops and closely monitor clinical status, including hepatic serum biochemistries. (  5.2  ) 
 *  Hepatotoxicity: Hepatic adverse events have been reported in patients receiving an RPV-containing regimen. Monitor liver-associated tests before and during treatment with ODEFSEY in patients with underlying hepatic disease or marked elevations in liver-associated tests. Also consider monitoring liver-associated tests in patients without risk factors. (  5.3  ) 
 *  Depressive disorders: Severe depressive disorders have been reported. Immediate medical evaluation is recommended for severe depressive disorders. (  5.4  ) 
 *  New onset or worsening renal impairment: Assessment of serum creatinine, estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein when initiating ODEFSEY and during therapy on a clinically appropriate schedule in all patients. Also assess serum phosphorus in patients with chronic kidney disease. (  5.5  ) 
 *  Concomitant use of ODEFSEY with drugs with a known risk to prolong the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram may increase the risk of Torsade de Pointes. (  5.6  ) 
 *  Lactic acidosis/severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: Discontinue treatment in patients who develop symptoms or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity. (  5.7  ) 
 *  Immune reconstitution syndrome: May necessitate further evaluation and treatment. (  5.8  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Severe Acute Exacerbation of Hepatitis B in Patients Coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV



  Test patients with HIV-1 for the presence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) before or when initiating antiretroviral therapy [see  Dosage and Administration (2.1)  ]  .



 Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B (e.g., liver decompensation and liver failure) have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV and have discontinued products containing FTC and/or TDF, and may occur with discontinuation of ODEFSEY. Patients coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV who discontinue ODEFSEY should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment with ODEFSEY. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted, especially in patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, since post treatment exacerbation of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation and liver failure.



    5.2 Skin and Hypersensitivity Reactions



  Severe skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including cases of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), have been reported during postmarketing experience with RPV-containing regimens. While some skin reactions were accompanied by constitutional symptoms such as fever, other skin reactions were associated with organ dysfunction, including elevations in hepatic serum biochemistries. During Phase 3 clinical trials of RPV, treatment-related rashes with at least Grade 2 severity were reported in 1% of subjects. Overall, most rashes were Grade 1 or 2 and occurred in the first four to six weeks of therapy [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ]  .



 Discontinue ODEFSEY immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin or hypersensitivity reactions develop, including but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, blisters, mucosal involvement, conjunctivitis, facial edema, angioedema, hepatitis, or eosinophilia. Clinical status including laboratory parameters should be monitored and appropriate therapy should be initiated.



    5.3 Hepatotoxicity



  Hepatic adverse events have been reported in patients receiving an RPV-containing regimen. Patients with underlying hepatitis B or C virus infection, or marked elevations in liver-associated tests prior to treatment, may be at increased risk for worsening or development of liver-associated test elevations with use of ODEFSEY. A few cases of hepatic toxicity have been reported in adult patients receiving an RPV-containing regimen who had no preexisting hepatic disease or other identifiable risk factors. Appropriate laboratory testing prior to initiating therapy and monitoring for hepatotoxicity during therapy with ODEFSEY is recommended in patients with underlying hepatic disease such as hepatitis B or C, or in patients with marked elevations in liver-associated tests prior to treatment initiation. Liver-associated test monitoring should also be considered for patients without preexisting hepatic dysfunction or other risk factors.



    5.4 Depressive Disorders



  Depressive disorders (including depressed mood, depression, dysphoria, major depression, mood altered, negative thoughts, suicide attempt, suicidal ideation) have been reported with RPV. Promptly evaluate patients with severe depressive symptoms to assess whether the symptoms are related to ODEFSEY, and to determine whether the risks of continued therapy outweigh the benefits.



 In Phase 3 trials of RPV in adult subjects (N=1368) through 96 weeks, the incidence of depressive disorders (regardless of causality, severity) reported among RPV-treated subjects (n=686) was 9%. Most events were mild or moderate in severity. In RPV-treated subjects, the incidence of Grades 3 and 4 depressive disorders (regardless of causality) was 1%, the incidence of discontinuation due to depressive disorders was 1%, and suicidal ideation and suicide attempt was reported in 4 and 2 subjects, respectively.



 During the Phase 2 trial in RPV-treated pediatric subjects 12 to less than 18 years of age (N=36), the incidence of depressive disorders (regardless of causality, severity) was 19% (7/36) through 48 weeks. Most events were mild or moderate in severity. The incidence of Grades 3 and 4 depressive disorders (regardless of causality) was 6% (2/36). None of the subjects discontinued due to depressive disorders. Suicidal ideation and suicide attempt were reported in 1 subject.



    5.5 New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment



  Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia), has been reported with the use of tenofovir prodrugs in both animal toxicology studies and human trials. In clinical trials of FTC+TAF with EVG+COBI, there have been no cases of Fanconi syndrome or proximal renal tubulopathy (PRT). In clinical trials of FTC+TAF with EVG+COBI in treatment-naive subjects and in virologically-suppressed subjects switched to FTC+TAF with EVG+COBI with eGFRs greater than 50 mL per minute, renal serious adverse events or discontinuations due to renal adverse reactions were encountered in less than 1% of participants treated with FTC+TAF with EVG+COBI. In a study of virologically-suppressed subjects with baseline eGFRs between 30 and 69 mL per minute treated with FTC+TAF with EVG+COBI for a median duration of 43 weeks, FTC+TAF with EVG+COBI was permanently discontinued due to worsening renal function in two of 80 (3%) subjects with a baseline eGFR between 30 and 50 mL per minute [ see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . ODEFSEY is not recommended in patients with estimated creatinine clearance below 30 mL per minute because data in this population are insufficient.



 Patients taking tenofovir prodrugs who have impaired renal function and those taking nephrotoxic agents, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are at increased risk of developing renal-related adverse reactions.



  Prior to or when initiating ODEFSEY, and during treatment with ODEFSEY, on a clinically appropriate schedule, assess serum creatinine, estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose and urine protein in all patients. In patients with chronic kidney disease, also assess serum phosphorus. Discontinue ODEFSEY in patients who develop clinically significant decreases in renal function or evidence of Fanconi syndrome.  



    5.6 Risk of Adverse Reactions or Loss of Virologic Response Due to Drug Interactions



  The concomitant use of ODEFSEY and other drugs may result in potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to [   see  Contraindications (4)  , and  Drug Interactions (7)  ]:  



 *  Loss of therapeutic effect of ODEFSEY and possible development of resistance due to reduced exposure of RPV. 
    In healthy subjects, higher than recommended doses of RPV (75 mg once daily and 300 mg once daily -3 and 12 times the recommended dosages in ODEFSEY, respectively) have been shown to prolong the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram. Consider alternatives to ODEFSEY when coadministered with a drug that is known to have a risk of Torsade de Pointes [see  Drug Interactions (7.2)  and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)  ]  .
 

 See  Table 3  for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations [see  Contraindications (4)  and  Drug Interactions (7)  ].  Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during ODEFSEY therapy and review concomitant medications during ODEFSEY therapy.



    5.7 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis



  Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs, including emtricitabine, a component of ODEFSEY, and tenofovir DF, another prodrug of tenofovir, alone or in combination with other antiretrovirals. Treatment with ODEFSEY should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations).



    5.8 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome



  Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including FTC and RPV, both components of ODEFSEY. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections [such as Mycobacterium avium  infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii  pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis], which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.



 Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.
