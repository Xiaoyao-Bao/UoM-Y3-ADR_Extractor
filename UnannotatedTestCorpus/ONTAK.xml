  6.1 Clinical Studies Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 Safety data are available for 3 clinical studies in which 234 patients received Ontak at 9 mcg/kg (n=80) or 18 mcg/kg (n=154) at the recommended schedule. Of these studies, 1 was placebo-controlled and dose-ranging (Study 1, 100 Ontak-treated patients), one was a dose-comparison of 9 and 18 mcg/kg (Study 2, n=71), and the third was a single-arm study using 18 mcg/kg (n=63); all studies were limited to adult patients with CTCL. The median age of patients across the clinical studies was 60 years (range 23-91 years) and 36% (n=85) were 65 years of age or older; 55% were men and 85% were Caucasian.



 Across all 3 studies, the most common adverse reactions in Ontak-treated patients (&gt;=20%) were pyrexia, nausea, fatigue, rigors, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, peripheral edema, cough, dyspnea and pruritus. The most common serious adverse reactions were capillary leak syndrome (11.1%), infusion reactions (8.1%), and visual changes including loss of visual acuity (4%). Ontak was discontinued in 28.2% (66/234) of patients due to adverse reactions.



 The data described in Table 1 reflect exposure to Ontak in 100 patients administered as a single agent at the recommended dosing schedule in the randomized placebo-controlled trial (Study 1). The median number of Ontak cycles was 7 (range 1-10) for the 9 mcg/kg cohort and 6 (range 1-11) for the 18 mcg/kg cohort. The median age of patients was 59 years (range 23-84 years) and 34% (n=34) were 65 years of age or older; 55% were men and 86% were Caucasian.

            Hepatobiliary Disorders:  Increase in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) from baseline occurred in 84% of subjects treated with Ontak (197/234). In the majority of subjects, these enzyme elevations occurred during either the first or the second cycle; enzyme elevation resolved without medical intervention and did not require discontinuation of Ontak.
 

   6.2 Immunogenicity

  An immune response to denileukin diftitox was assessed using 2 enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELISA). The first assay measured reactivity directed against intact denileukin diftitox calibrated against anti-diphtheria toxin, and the second assay measured reactivity against the IL-2 portion of the protein. An additional  in vitro  cell-based assay that measured the ability of antibodies in serum to protect a human IL-2R-expressing cell line from toxicity by denileukin diftitox, was used to detect the presence of neutralizing antibodies which inhibited functional activity. The immunogenicity data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were considered positive for antibodies to the intact fusion protein denileukin diftitox. These results are highly dependent on the sensitivity and the specificity of the assays. Additionally, the observed incidence of the antibody positivity may be influenced by several factors, including sample handling, concomitant medication, and underlying disease. For these reasons, the comparison of the incidence of antibodies to denileukin diftitox with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.



 In Study 1 [see  Clinical Studies (  14.1  )  ], of 95 patients treated with denileukin diftitox, 66% tested positive for antibodies at baseline probably due to a prior exposure to diphtheria toxin or its vaccine. After 1, 2, and 3 courses of treatment, 94%, 99%, and 100% of patients tested positive, respectively. Mean titers of anti-denileukin diftitox antibodies were similarly increased in the 9 and 18 mcg/kg/day dose groups after 2 courses of treatment. Meanwhile, pharmacokinetic parameters decreased substantially (Cmax~57%, AUC~80%), and clearance increased 2- to 8-fold.



 In Study 2 [see  Clinical Studies (  14.2  )  ], 131 patients were assessed for binding antibodies. Of these, 51 patients (39%) had antibodies at baseline. Seventy-six percent of patients tested positive after 1 course of treatment and 97% after 3 courses of treatment. Neutralizing antibodies were assessed in 60 patients; 45%, 73%, and 97% had evidence of inhibited functional activity in the cellular assay at baseline and after 1 and 3 courses of treatment, respectively.



   6.3 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Ontak. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 Thyroid conditions: hyperthyroidism, thyroiditis, thyrotoxicosis, and hypothyroidism.

   EXCERPT:    *   Infusion reactions: Immediately stop and permanently discontinue Ontak for serious infusion reactions. Monitor patients following infusion. (  5.1  ) 
 *   Capillary leak syndrome: Monitor weight, edema, blood pressure and serum albumin levels. (  5.2  ) 
 *   Loss of Visual Acuity and Color Vision: Monitor visual acuity and color vision. (  5.3  ) 
 *   Laboratory Tests: Monitor serum albumin levels prior to the initiation of each treatment course. Delay administration of Ontak until serum albumin levels are at least 3.0 g/dL. (  5.5  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Infusion Reactions



  Infusion reactions, defined as symptoms occurring within 24 hours of infusion and resolving within 48 hours of the last infusion in that course, were reported in 70.5% (165/234) of Ontak-treated patients across 3 clinical studies utilizing the approved doses and schedule. Serious infusion reactions were reported in 8.1% (19/234) of Ontak-treated patients. There have been post-marketing reports of infusion reactions resulting in death.



 For patients completing at least 4 courses of Ontak treatment in Study 1 [see Clinical Studies (  14.1  )  ], the incidence of infusion reactions was lower in the 3  rd  and 4  th  cycles as compared to the 1  st  and 2  nd  cycles of Ontak.



 Resuscitative equipment should be available during Ontak administration. Immediately stop and permanently discontinue Ontak for serious infusion reactions.



    5.2 Capillary Leak Syndrome



  Capillary leak syndrome was defined as the occurrence of at least 2 of the following 3 symptoms (hypotension, edema, serum albumin &lt;3.0 g/dL) at any time during Ontak therapy. These symptoms were not required to occur simultaneously to be characterized as capillary leak syndrome. As defined, capillary leak syndrome was reported in 32.5% (76/234) of Ontak-treated patients. Among these 76 patients with capillary leak syndrome, one-third required hospitalization or medical intervention to prevent hospitalization. There have been post-marketing reports of capillary leak syndrome resulting in death.



 The onset of symptoms in patients with capillary leak syndrome may be delayed, occurring up to 2 weeks following infusion. Symptoms may persist or worsen after the cessation of Ontak.



 Regularly assess patients for weight gain, new onset or worsening edema, hypotension (including orthostatic changes) and monitor serum albumin levels prior to the initiation of each course of therapy and more often as clinically indicated. Withhold Ontak for serum albumin levels of less than 3.0 g/dL [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.5  )  ].



    5.3 Visual Loss



  Loss of visual acuity, usually with loss of color vision, with or without retinal pigment mottling has been reported following administration of Ontak. Recovery was reported in some of the affected patients; however, most patients reported persistent visual impairment.



    5.4 CD25 Tumor Expression and Evaluation



  Confirm that the patient's malignant cells express CD25 prior to administration of Ontak. A testing service for the assay of CD25 expression in tumor biopsy samples is available. For information on this service call 877-873-4724.



    5.5 Laboratory Monitoring/Hypoalbuminemia



  Monitor serum albumin levels prior to the initiation of each treatment course. Withhold administration of Ontak if serum albumin levels are less than 3.0 g/dL [see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  )  and Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )  ].
