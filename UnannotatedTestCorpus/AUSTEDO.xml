  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



   Patients with Huntington's Disease  



 Study 1 was a randomized, 12-week, placebo-controlled study in patients with chorea associated with Huntington's disease. A total of 45 patients received AUSTEDO, and 45 patients received placebo. Patients ranged in age between 23 and 74 years (mean 54 years); 56% were male, and 92% were Caucasian. The most common adverse reactions occurring in greater than 8% of AUSTEDO-treated patients were somnolence, diarrhea, dry mouth, and fatigue. Adverse reactions occurring in 4% or more of patients treated with AUSTEDO, and with a greater incidence than in patients on placebo, are summarized in Table 2.

         One or more adverse reactions resulted in a reduction of the dose of study medication in 7% of patients in Study 1. The most common adverse reaction resulting in dose reduction in patients receiving AUSTEDO was dizziness (4%).
 

 Agitation led to discontinuation in 2% of patients treated with AUSTEDO in Study 1.



   Patients with Tardive Dyskinesia  



 The data described below reflect 410 tardive dyskinesia patients participating in clinical trials. AUSTEDO was studied primarily in two 12-week, placebo-controlled trials (fixed dose, dose escalation). The population was 18 to 80 years of age, and had tardive dyskinesia and had concurrent diagnoses of mood disorder (33%) or schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder (63%). In these studies, AUSTEDO was administered in doses ranging from 12-48 mg per day. All patients continued on previous stable regimens of antipsychotics; 71% and 14% respective atypical and typical antipsychotic medications at study entry.



 The most common adverse reactions occurring in greater than 3% of AUSTEDO-treated patients and greater than placebo were nasopharyngitis and insomnia. The adverse reactions occurring in &gt;2% or more patients treated with AUSTEDO (12-48 mg per day) and greater than in placebo patients in two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in patients with tardive dyskinesia (Study 1 and Study 2) are summarized in Table 3.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: DEPRESSION AND SUICIDALITY IN PATIENTS WITH HUNTINGTON'S DISEASE

  WARNING: DEPRESSION AND SUICIDALITY IN PATIENTS WITH HUNTINGTON'S DISEASE

      AUSTEDO can increase the risk of depression and suicidal thoughts and behavior (suicidality) in patients with Huntington's disease. Anyone considering the use of AUSTEDO must balance the risks of depression and suicidality with the clinical need for treatment of chorea. Closely monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed of the risk of depression and suicidality and should be instructed to report behaviors of concern promptly to the treating physician.     



     Particular caution should be exercised in treating patients with a history of depression or prior suicide attempts or ideation, which are increased in frequency in Huntington's disease. AUSTEDO is contraindicated in patients who are suicidal, and in patients with untreated or inadequately treated depression   [see Contraindications (  4  ) and Warnings and Precautions (  5.1                )].

   5.1 Depression and Suicidality in Patients with Huntington's Disease



   Patients with Huntington's disease are at increased risk for depression, and suicidal ideation or behaviors (suicidality). AUSTEDO may increase the risk for suicidality in patients with Huntington's disease.  



  In a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, suicidal ideation was reported by 2% of patients treated with AUSTEDO, compared to no patients on placebo; no suicide attempts and no completed suicides were reported. Depression was reported by 4% of patients treated with AUSTEDO.  



  When considering the use of AUSTEDO, the risk of suicidality should be balanced against the need for treatment of chorea. All patients treated with AUSTEDO should be observed for new or worsening depression or suicidality. If depression or suicidality does not resolve, consider discontinuing treatment with AUSTEDO.  



  Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed of the risks of depression, worsening depression, and suicidality associated with AUSTEDO, and should be instructed to report behaviors of concern promptly to the treating physician. Patients with Huntington's disease who express suicidal ideation should be evaluated immediately.  



    5.2 Clinical Worsening and Adverse Events in Patients with Huntington's Disease



   Huntington's disease is a progressive disorder characterized by changes in mood, cognition, chorea, rigidity, and functional capacity over time. VMAT2 inhibitors, including AUSTEDO, may cause a worsening in mood, cognition, rigidity, and functional capacity.  



  Prescribers should periodically re-evaluate the need for AUSTEDO in their patients by assessing the effect on chorea and possible adverse effects, including sedation/somnolence, depression and suicidality, parkinsonism, akathisia, restlessness, and cognitive decline. It may be difficult to distinguish between adverse reactions and progression of the underlying disease; decreasing the dose or stopping the drug may help the clinician to distinguish between the two possibilities. In some patients, the underlying chorea itself may improve over time, decreasing the need for AUSTEDO.  



    5.3 QTc Prolongation



   Tetrabenazine, a closely related VMAT2 inhibitor, causes an increase (about 8 msec) in the corrected QT (QTc) interval.  



  A clinically relevant QT prolongation may occur in some patients treated with AUSTEDO who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers or are co-administered a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor [see Clinical Pharmacology (       12.2   ,    12.3   )].    



  For patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers or are taking a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor, dose reduction may be necessary [see Dosage and Administration (       2.3   ,    2.4   )]     . The use of AUSTEDO in combination with other drugs that are known to prolong QTc may result in clinically significant QT prolongations [see Drug Interactions (       7.2   )].    



  For patients requiring AUSTEDO doses greater than 24 mg per day who are using AUSTEDO with other drugs known to prolong QTc, assess the QTc interval before and after increasing the dose of AUSTEDO or other medications that are known to prolong QTc.  



  AUSTEDO should also be avoided in patients with congenital long QT syndrome and in patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias. Certain circumstances may increase the risk of the occurrence of torsade de pointes and/or sudden death in association with the use of drugs that prolong the QTc interval, including (1) bradycardia; (2) hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia; (3) concomitant use of other drugs that prolong the QTc interval; and (4) presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval.  



    5.4 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)



  A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with drugs that reduce dopaminergic transmission. While NMS has not been observed in patients receiving AUSTEDO, it has been observed in patients receiving tetrabenazine (a closely related VMAT2 inhibitor). Clinicians should be alerted to the signs and symptoms associated with NMS. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure. The diagnosis of NMS can be complicated; other serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal disorders can present with similar signs and symptoms. Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever, and primary central nervous system pathology.



 The management of NMS should include (1) immediate discontinuation of AUSTEDO; (2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring; and (3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for NMS.



 Recurrence of NMS has been reported with resumption of drug therapy. If treatment with AUSTEDO is needed after recovery from NMS, patients should be monitored for signs of recurrence.



    5.5 Akathisia, Agitation, and Restlessness



   AUSTEDO may increase the risk of akathisia, agitation, and restlessness in patients with Huntington's disease and tardive dyskinesia.  



  In a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in Huntington's disease patients, akathisia, agitation, or restlessness was reported by 4% of patients treated with AUSTEDO, compared to 2% of patients on placebo; in patients with tardive dyskinesia, 2% of patients treated with AUSTEDO and 1% of patients on placebo experienced these events.  



  Patients receiving AUSTEDO should be monitored for signs and symptoms of restlessness and agitation, as these may be indicators of developing akathisia. If a patient develops akathisia during treatment with AUSTEDO, the AUSTEDO dose should be reduced; some patients may require discontinuation of therapy.  



    5.6 Parkinsonism in Patients with Huntington's Disease



  AUSTEDO may cause parkinsonism in patients with Huntington's disease.



 Because rigidity can develop as part of the underlying disease process in Huntington's disease, it may be difficult to distinguish between this potential drug-induced adverse reaction and progression of the underlying disease process. Drug-induced parkinsonism has the potential to cause more functional disability than untreated chorea for some patients with Huntington's disease. If a patient develops parkinsonism during treatment with AUSTEDO, the AUSTEDO dose should be reduced; some patients may require discontinuation of therapy.



    5.7 Sedation and Somnolence



   Sedation is a common dose-limiting adverse reaction of AUSTEDO. In a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial examining patients with Huntington's disease, 11% of AUSTEDO-treated patients reported somnolence compared with 4% of patients on placebo and 9% of AUSTEDO-treated patients reported fatigue compared with 4% of placebo-treated patients.  



 Patients should not perform activities requiring mental alertness to maintain the safety of themselves or others, such as operating a motor vehicle or operating hazardous machinery, until they are on a maintenance dose of AUSTEDO and know how the drug affects them.



    5.8 Hyperprolactinemia



  Serum prolactin levels were not evaluated in the AUSTEDO development program. Tetrabenazine, a closely related VMAT2 inhibitor, elevates serum prolactin concentrations in humans. Following administration of 25 mg of tetrabenazine to healthy volunteers, peak plasma prolactin levels increased 4- to 5-fold.



 Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin-dependent in vitro  , a factor of potential importance if AUSTEDO is being considered for a patient with previously detected breast cancer. Although amenorrhea, galactorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence can be caused by elevated serum prolactin concentrations, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin concentrations for most patients is unknown.



 Chronic increase in serum prolactin levels (although not evaluated in the AUSTEDO or tetrabenazine development programs) has been associated with low levels of estrogen and increased risk of osteoporosis. If there is a clinical suspicion of symptomatic hyperprolactinemia, appropriate laboratory testing should be done and consideration should be given to discontinuation of AUSTEDO.



    5.9 Binding to Melanin-Containing Tissues



  Since deutetrabenazine or its metabolites bind to melanin-containing tissues, it could accumulate in these tissues over time. This raises the possibility that AUSTEDO may cause toxicity in these tissues after extended use. Neither ophthalmologic nor microscopic examination of the eye has been conducted in the chronic toxicity studies in a pigmented species such as dogs. Ophthalmologic monitoring in humans was inadequate to exclude the possibility of injury occurring after long-term exposure.



 The clinical relevance of deutetrabenazine's binding to melanin-containing tissues is unknown. Although there are no specific recommendations for periodic ophthalmologic monitoring, prescribers should be aware of the possibility of long-term ophthalmologic effects [see Clinical Pharmacology (  12.2  )].
