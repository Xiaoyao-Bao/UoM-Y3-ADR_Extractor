  The following local adverse reactions are reported infrequently with topical corticosteroids, but may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings. These reactions are listed in an approximate decreasing order of occurrence:



 Burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, hypertrichosis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, maceration of the skin, secondary infection, skin atrophy, striae, and miliaria.



 In controlled clinical studies the incidence of adverse reactions were low (0.8%) for Topicort  (r)  (desoximetasone cream USP) 0.25%, and included burning, folliculitis, and folliculo-pustular lesions. The incidence of adverse reactions were also 0.8% for Topicort  (r)  (desoximetasone cream USP) 0.05% and included pruritus, erythema, vesiculation, and burning sensation. The incidence of adverse reactions for Topicort  (r)  (desoximetasone gel USP), 0.05% was 0.3% with one subject reporting stinging and burning at the site of application.

   General



  Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for clinical glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. This may occur during treatment or upon withdrawal of the topical corticosteroid.



 Because of the potential for systemic absorption, use of topical corticosteroids may require that patients be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression. Factors that predispose a patient using a topical corticosteroid to HPA axis suppression include the use of more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, use over prolonged periods, use under occlusion, use on an altered skin barrier, and use in patients with liver failure.



 An ACTH stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression. If HPA axis suppression is documented, an attempt should be made to gradually withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent steroid. Manifestations of adrenal insufficiency may require supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids.



 Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and unmasking of latent diabetes mellitus can also result from systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids.



 Use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase the total systemic corticosteroid exposure.



 Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from use of topical corticosteroids.



    Local Adverse Reactions with Topical Corticosteroids



  Local adverse reactions may be more likely to occur with occlusive use, prolonged use or use of higher potency corticosteroids. Reactions may include atrophy, striae, telangiectasias, burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, and miliaria. Some local adverse reactions may be irreversible.



    Allergic Contact Dermatitis with Topical Corticosteroids



  Allergic contact dermatitis to any component of topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by a failure to heal rather than a clinical exacerbation. Clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be confirmed by patch testing.



    Concomitant Skin Infections



  Concomitant skin infections should be treated with an appropriate antimicrobial agent. If the infection persists, Topicort  (r)  (desoximetasone cream USP) 0.05%, Topicort  (r)  (desoximetasone cream USP) 0.25%, or Topicort  (r)  (desoximetasone gel USP) 0.05% should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately treated.



    Information for the Patient



  Patients using topical corticosteroids should receive the following information and instructions:



 *  This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is for external use only. Avoid contact with the eyes. 
 *  Patients should be advised not to use this medication for any disorder other than that for which it was prescribed. 
 *  The treated skin area should not be bandaged or otherwise covered or wrapped so as to be occlusive unless directed by the physician. 
 *  Patients should report any signs of local adverse reactions, especially under occlusive dressings. 
 *  Other corticosteroid-containing products should not be used with Topicort  (r)  (desoximetasone cream USP) 0.05%, Topicort  (r)  (desoximetasone cream USP) 0.25%, or Topicort  (r)  (desoximetasone gel USP) 0.05% without first consulting with the physician. 
    As with other corticosteroids, therapy should be discontinued when control is achieved. If no improvement is seen within 4 weeks, contact the physician.
 

    Laboratory Tests



  The following tests may be helpful in evaluating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression:



 *     Urinary free cortisol test 
 *     ACTH stimulation test 
       Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility
 

  Long-term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential or the effect on fertility of topical corticosteroids.



 Desoximetasone was nonmutagenic in the Ames test.



    Pregnancy



   Teratogenic Effects



   Pregnancy Category C



  Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. Some corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals.



 Desoximetasone has been shown to be teratogenic and embryotoxic in mice, rats, and rabbits when given by subcutaneous or dermal routes of administration in doses 3 to 30 times the human dose of Topicort  (r)  (desoximetasone cream USP) 0.25% and 15 to 150 times the human dose of Topicort  (r)  (desoximetasone cream USP) 0.05%, or Topicort  (r)  (desoximetasone gel USP) 0.05%.



 There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women on teratogenic effects from topically applied corticosteroids. Therefore, Topicort  (r)  (desoximetasone cream USP) 0.05%, Topicort  (r)  (desoximetasone cream USP) 0.25%, or Topicort  (r)  (desoximetasone gel USP) 0.05%, should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Drugs of this class should not be used extensively on pregnant patients, in large amounts, or for prolonged periods of time.



    Nursing Mothers



  It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in breast milk. Systemically administered corticosteroids are secreted into breast milk in quantities not likely to have a deleterious effect on the infant. Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when topical corticosteroids are administered to a nursing woman.



    Pediatric Use



   Pediatric patients may demonstrate greater susceptibility to topical corticosteroid-induced HPA axis suppression and Cushing's syndrome than mature patients because of a larger skin surface area to body weight ratio.  



 Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in pediatric patients receiving topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in pediatric patients include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, low plasma cortisol levels, and absence of response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema.



 Administration of topical corticosteroids to pediatric patients should be limited to the least amount compatible with an effective therapeutic regimen. Chronic corticosteroid therapy may interfere with the growth and development of pediatric patients.
