    <Section id="S3" name="precautions">    PRECAUTIONS



   General



  Caution is advised when prescribing this drug to patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, asthma, or prostatic hypertrophy.



    Special Risk Patients



  As with any narcotic agent, Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended-Release Oral Suspension should be used with caution in elderly or debilitated patients and those with severe impairment of hepatic or renal function, hypothyroidism, Addison's disease, prostatic hypertrophy, or urethral stricture. The usual precautions should be observed and the possibility of respiratory depression should be kept in mind.



    Information for Patients



  Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).



    Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants



  Inform patients and caregivers that potentially fatal additive effects may occur if Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended-Release Oral Suspension is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol. Because of this risk, patients should avoid concomitant use of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended-Release Oral Suspension with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol (see  WARNINGS  and  PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions  ).



    Neurological Adverse Reactions



  Advise patients that Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended-Release Oral Suspension may produce marked drowsiness and impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery. Advise patients to avoid driving or operating machinery during treatment with Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended-Release Oral Suspension.



    Dosing Instructions



  Advise patients not to dilute Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended-Release Oral Suspension with other fluids and not to mix with other drugs as this may alter the resin-binding and changes the absorption rate, possibly increasing the toxicity.



 Advise patients that Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended-Release Oral Suspension should be measured with an accurate measuring device. A household teaspoon is not an accurate measuring device and could lead to overdosage. A dosing spoon is provided with the 4 oz (118 mL) packaged product. One side of the spoon is for a 2.5 mL dose. The other side of the spoon is for a 5 mL dose. Instruct the patient to fill to level the side of the spoon for the dose that has been prescribed. The spoon should not be overfilled. Rinse the measuring device or dosing spoon after each use.



 Alternatively, a pharmacist can recommend an appropriate measuring device and can provide instructions for measuring the correct dose.



    Cough Reflex



  Hydrocodone suppresses the cough reflex; as with all narcotics, caution should be exercised when Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended-Release Oral Suspension is used postoperatively, and in patients with pulmonary disease.



    Drug Interactions



  The use of benzodiazepines, opioids, antihistamines, antipsychotics, anti-anxiety agents, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) concomitantly with Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended-Release Oral Suspension may cause an additive CNS depressant effect, profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death and should be avoided (see  WARNINGS  ).



 The use of MAO inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants with hydrocodone preparations may increase the effect of either the antidepressant or hydrocodone.



 The concurrent use of other anticholinergics with hydrocodone may produce paralytic ileus.



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility



  Carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, and reproductive studies have not been conducted with Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended-Release Oral Suspension.



    Pregnancy



   Teratogenic Effects



   Pregnancy Category C



  Hydrocodone has been shown to be teratogenic in hamsters when given in doses 700 times the human dose. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended-Release Oral Suspension should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.



    Nonteratogenic Effects



  Babies born to mothers who have been taking opioids regularly prior to delivery will be physically dependent. The withdrawal signs include irritability and excessive crying, tremors, hyperactive reflexes, increased respiratory rate, increased stools, sneezing, yawning, vomiting, and fever. The intensity of the syndrome does not always correlate with the duration of maternal opioid use or dose.



    Labor and Delivery



  As with all narcotics, administration of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended-Release Oral Suspension to the mother shortly before delivery may result in some degree of respiratory depression in the newborn, especially if higher doses are used.



    Nursing Mothers



  It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended-Release Oral Suspension, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.



    Pediatric Use



  The use of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended-Release Oral Suspension is contraindicated in children less than 6 years of age (see  CONTRAINDICATIONS  and  ADVERSE REACTIONS, Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders  ).



 Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended-Release Oral Suspension should be used with caution in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older (see  WARNINGS, Pediatric Use  ).



    Geriatric Use



  Clinical studies of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended-Release Oral Suspension did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.



 This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

   Risk from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or other CNS Depressants



  Concomitant use of opioids, including Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended-Release Oral Suspension, with benzodiazepines, or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, avoid use of opioid cough medications in patients taking benzodiazepines, other CNS depressants, or alcohol (see  PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions  ).



 Observation studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepins increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. Because of similar pharmacologic properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with concomitant use of opioid cough medications and benzodiazepines, other CNS depressants, or alcohol.



 Advise both patients and caregivers about the risk of respiratory depression and sedation if Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended-Release Oral Suspension is used with benzodiazepines, alcohol, or other CNS depressants (see  PRECAUTIONS - Information for Patients  ).



    Respiratory Depression



  As with all narcotics, Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended-Release Oral Suspension produces dose-related respiratory depression by directly acting on brain stem respiratory centers. Hydrocodone affects the center that controls respiratory rhythm and may produce irregular and periodic breathing. Caution should be exercised when Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended-Release Oral Suspension is used postoperatively and in patients with pulmonary disease, or whenever ventilatory function is depressed. If respiratory depression occurs, it may be antagonized by the use of naloxone hydrochloride and other supportive measures when indicated (see  OVERDOSAGE  ).



    Head Injury and Increased Intracranial Pressure



  The respiratory depressant effects of narcotics and their capacity to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of head injury, other intracranial lesions, or a pre-existing increase in intracranial pressure. Furthermore, narcotics produce adverse reactions, which may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injuries.



    Acute Abdominal Conditions



  The administration of narcotics may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions.



    Obstructive Bowel Disease



  Chronic use of narcotics may result in obstructive bowel disease especially in patients with underlying intestinal motility disorder.



    Pediatric Use



  The use of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended-Release Oral Suspension is contraindicated in children less than 6 years of age (see  CONTRAINDICATIONS  ).



 In pediatric patients, as well as adults, the respiratory center is sensitive to the depressant action of narcotic cough suppressants in a dose-dependent manner. Caution should be exercised when administering Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended-Release Oral Suspension to pediatric patients 6 years of age and older. Overdose or concomitant administration of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended-Release Oral Suspension with other respiratory depressants may increase the risk of respiratory depression in pediatric patients. Benefit to risk ratio should be carefully considered, especially in pediatric patients with respiratory embarrassment (e.g., croup) (see  PRECAUTIONS  ).
