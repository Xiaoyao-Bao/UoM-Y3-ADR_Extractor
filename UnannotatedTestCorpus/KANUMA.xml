  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 In clinical trials, a total of 106 patients received treatment with KANUMA. The data described below reflect exposure to KANUMA in 75 patients who received KANUMA at dosages up to 3 mg/kg once weekly in clinical trials:



 *  Nine patients (5 males, 4 females) who had growth failure or other evidence of rapidly progressive LAL deficiency presenting within the first 6 months of life received KANUMA for up to 165 weeks (median 60 weeks) at escalating doses ranging between 0.35 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg once weekly [see  Clinical Studies (14.1)  ] . The recommended initial dosage for these patients is 1 mg/kg escalating to 3 mg/kg once weekly [see  Dosage and Administration (2.1)  ].  
 *  66 pediatric and adult patients with LAL deficiency aged 4 to 58 years (33 males, 33 females) received KANUMA 1 mg/kg every other week up to 36 weeks. 
    Table 2 summarizes the most common adverse reactions occurring in &gt;30% of patients with rapidly progressive LAL deficiency presenting within the first 6 months of life receiving KANUMA.

     Hyperlipidemia  



 Increases in circulating LDL-cholesterol (LDL-c) and triglycerides above pre-treatment values were observed in 29 of 36 (81%) and 21 of 36 (58%) patients, respectively, at 2 and 4 weeks following initiation of KANUMA  [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)  ]  . The maximum mean percentage increase was 18% for LDL-c at Week 2 and 5% for triglycerides at Week 4.



   6.2 Immunogenicity

  As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. Patients have developed anti-drug antibodies (ADA) to KANUMA. Immunogenicity assay results are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay and may be influenced by several factors such as: assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to KANUMA with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.



     Patients with Rapidly Progressive LAL Deficiency Presenting within the First 6 Months of Life  



 Seven of the 9 infants with rapidly progressive disease had at least one post-treatment ADA assessment, and 4 of these 7 (57%) patients developed ADA during treatment with KANUMA. Two of the 4 ADA-positive patients were determined to be positive for neutralizing antibodies that inhibit  in vitro  enzyme activity and cellular uptake of the enzyme. At the time of initial ADA positivity, 3 patients were receiving a dosage of 1 mg/kg once weekly and 1 patient was receiving a dosage of 3 mg/kg once weekly. Three of the 4 ADA-positive patients had ADA titers monitored from the initiation of treatment, and developed measureable ADA titers within the first 2 months of exposure. One of the 4 ADA-positive patients had persistent ADA titers. ADA titers decreased to undetectable levels in the remaining 3 patients while receiving continued treatment at a dosage of 3 mg/kg once weekly.



 Hypersensitivity reactions occurred in all 4 of the ADA-positive patients, whereas they occurred in only 1 of the 3 ADA-negative patients. None of the patients discontinued treatment. In 1 patient, decreased growth velocity in a setting of neutralizing antibodies to KANUMA was observed.



     Pediatric and Adult Patients with LAL Deficiency  



 Five of 35 (14%) KANUMA-treated pediatric and adult patients who completed the 20-week double-blind period of study treatment developed ADA. All patients were receiving 1 mg/kg once every other week. All 5 ADA-positive patients first developed measurable ADA titers within the first 3 months of exposure. Two of the 5 ADA-positive patients had a measurable ADA titer at only one time point. In the 3 patients with measurable ADA titers at multiple time points, ADA titers decreased to undetectable levels during continued treatment. Two patients developed  in vitro  neutralizing antibodies during the open-label extension phase after 20 weeks and 52 weeks of treatment with KANUMA, respectively. There is no clear association between the development of ADA and decreased efficacy in pediatric and adult patients treated with KANUMA.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *   Hypersensitivity Reactions including Anaphylaxis: Observe patients during and after the infusion. Consider interrupting the infusion or lowering the infusion rate, based on the severity of the reaction. If a severe hypersensitivity reaction occurs, immediately stop the infusion and initiate appropriate treatment. Pre-treatment with antipyretics and/or antihistamines may prevent subsequent reactions in those cases where symptomatic treatment is required. (  5.1  ) 
 *   Hypersensitivity to Eggs or Egg Products: Consider the risks and benefits of treatment in patients with known systemic hypersensitivity reactions to eggs or egg products. (  5.2  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Including Anaphylaxis



  Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported in KANUMA-treated patients. In clinical trials, 3 of 106 (3%) patients treated with KANUMA experienced signs and symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis. These patients experienced reactions during infusion with signs and symptoms including chest discomfort, conjunctival injection, dyspnea, generalized and itchy rash, hyperemia, swelling of eyelids, rhinorrhea, severe respiratory distress, tachycardia, tachypnea, and urticaria. Anaphylaxis has occurred as early as the sixth infusion and as late as 1 year after treatment initiation.



 In clinical trials, 21 of 106 (20%) KANUMA-treated patients, including 9 of 14 (64%) infants and 12 of 92 (13%) pediatric patients, 4 years and older, and adults, experienced signs and symptoms either consistent with or that may be related to a hypersensitivity reaction. Signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions, occurring in two or more patients, included abdominal pain, agitation, fever, chills, diarrhea, eczema, edema, hypertension, irritability, laryngeal edema, nausea, pallor, pruritus, rash, and vomiting. The majority of reactions occurred during or within 4 hours of the completion of the infusion. Patients were not routinely pre-medicated prior to infusion of KANUMA in these clinical trials.



 Due to the potential for anaphylaxis, appropriate medical support should be readily available when KANUMA is administered. If anaphylaxis occurs, immediately discontinue the infusion and initiate appropriate medical treatment. Observe patients closely during and after the infusion. Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis, and instruct them to seek immediate medical care should signs and symptoms occur.



 The management of hypersensitivity reactions should be based on the severity of the reaction and may include temporarily interrupting the infusion, lowering the infusion rate, and/or treatment with antihistamines, antipyretics, and/or corticosteroids. If interrupted, the infusion may be resumed at a slower rate with increases as tolerated. Pre-treatment with antipyretics and/or antihistamines may prevent subsequent reactions in those cases where symptomatic treatment was required. If a severe hypersensitivity reaction occurs, immediately discontinue the infusion and initiate appropriate medical treatment.



 Consider the risks and benefits of re-administering KANUMA following a severe reaction. Monitor patients, with appropriate resuscitation measures available, if the decision is made to re-administer the product.



    5.2 Hypersensitivity to Eggs or Egg Products



  KANUMA is produced in the egg whites of genetically engineered chickens. Patients with a known history of egg allergies were excluded from the clinical trials. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment with KANUMA in patients with known systemic hypersensitivity reactions to eggs or egg products.
