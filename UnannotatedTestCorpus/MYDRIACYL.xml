    Ocular:  Transient stinging, blurred vision, photophobia and superficial punctate keratitis have been reported with the use of tropicamide. Increased intraocular pressure has been reported following the use of mydriatics.



   Non-Ocular:  Dryness of the mouth, tachycardia, headache, allergic reactions, nausea, vomiting, pallor, central nervous system disturbances and muscle rigidity have been reported with the use of tropicamide. Psychotic reactions, behavioral disturbances, and vasomotor or cardiorespiratory collapse in children have been reported with the use of anticholinergic drugs.

   General



  The lacrimal sac should be compressed by digital pressure for two to three minutes after instillation to reduce excessive systemic absorption.



    Information for Patients



  Do not touch dropper tip to any surface, as this may contaminate the solution. Patient should be advised not to drive or engage in potentially hazardous activities while pupils are dilated. Patient may experience sensitivity to light and should protect eyes in bright illumination during dilation. Parents should be warned not to get this preparation in their child's mouth and to wash their own hands and the child's hands following administration.



    Drug Interactions



  Tropicamide may interfere with the antihypertensive action of carbachol, pilocarpine, or ophthalmic cholinesterase inhibitors.



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility



  There have been no long-term studies done using tropicamide in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential.



    Pregnancy



  Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with tropicamide. It is also not known whether tropicamide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Tropicamide should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.



    Nursing Mothers



  It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tropicamide is administered to a nursing woman.



    Pediatric Use



  Tropicamide may rarely cause CNS disturbances which may be dangerous in pediatric patients. Psychotic reactions, behavioral disturbances, and vasomotor or cardiorespiratory collapse in children have been reported with the use of anticholinergic drugs (see WARNINGS  ). Keep this and all medications out of the reach of children.



    Geriatric Use



  No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients.

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings">    WARNINGS



  FOR TOPICAL OPHTHALMIC USE ONLY. NOT FOR INJECTION.



 This preparation may cause CNS disturbances which may be dangerous in pediatric patients. The possibility of psychotic reactions and behavioral disturbances due to hypersensitivity to anticholinergic drugs should be considered.



 Mydriatics may produce a transient elevation of intraocular pressure.



 Remove contact lenses before using.
