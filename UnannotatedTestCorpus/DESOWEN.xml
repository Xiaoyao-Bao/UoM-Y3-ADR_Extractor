    <Section id="S1" name="adverse reactions">    ADVERSE REACTIONS:

  In controlled clinical trials, the total incidence of adverse reactions associated with the use of desonide was approximately 8%. These were: stinging and burning approximately 3%, irritation, contact dermatitis, condition worsened, peeling of skin, itching, intense transient erythema, and dryness/scaliness, each less than 2%.



 The following additional local adverse reactions have been reported infrequently with other topical corticosteroids, and they may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings, especially with higher potency corticosteroids. These reactions are listed in an approximate decreasing order of occurrence: folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, secondary infection, skin atrophy, striae, and miliaria.

    <Section id="S2" name="precautions">    PRECAUTIONS:



   General:



  Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment. Manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria can also be produced in some patients by systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids while on treatment.



 Patients applying a topical steroid to a large surface area or to areas under occlusion should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression. This may be done by using the ACTH stimulation, A.M. plasma cortisol, and urinary free cortisol tests. Patients receiving superpotent corticosteroids should not be treated for more than 2 weeks at a time and only small areas should be treated at any one time due to the increased risk of HPA axis suppression.



 If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent corticosteroid. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency may occur requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. For information on systemic supplementation, see prescribing information for those products.



 Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios. (See PRECAUTIONS - Pediatric use).



 If irritation develops, DesOwen  (r)  Cream or Lotion should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Allergic contact dermatitis with corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by observing failure to heal  rather than noting a clinical exacerbation as with most topical products not containing corticosteroids. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic patch testing.



 If concomitant skin infections are present or develop, an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be used. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, use of DesOwen  (r)  (desonide cream and lotion) Cream or Lotion should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled.



    Information for patients:



  Patients using topical corticosteroids should receive the following information and instructions:



 *   This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is for external use only. Avoid contact with the eyes.
 
    

 item{ This medication should not be used for any disorder other than that for which it was prescribed.
 

 item{ The treated skin area should not be bandaged or otherwise covered or wrapped so as to be occlusive unless directed by the physician.
 

 item{ Patients should report to their physician any signs of local adverse reactions.
 

}}    Laboratory tests:



  The following tests may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression:



 ACTH stimulation test



 A.M. plasma cortisol test



 Urinary free cortisol test



    Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility:



  Long-term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential or the effect on reproduction with the use of DesOwen  (r)  Cream and Lotion.



    Pregnancy:



   



   Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy category C:  



 Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. Some corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with DesOwen  (r)  Cream or Lotion. It is also not known whether DesOwen  (r)  Cream or Lotion can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. DesOwen  (r)  Cream and Lotion should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.



    Nursing mothers:



  Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when DesOwen  (r)  Cream or Lotion is administered to a nursing woman.



    Pediatric use:



  Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, pediatric patients are at a greater risk than adults of HPA axis suppression when they are treated with topical corticosteroids. They are therefore also at greater risk of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment and of Cushing's syndrome while on treatment. Adverse effects including striae have been reported with inappropriate use of topical corticosteroids in infants and children.



 HPA axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include low plasma cortisol levels, and absence of response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema.
