  The safety of Gonal-f  (r)  was examined in four clinical studies that enrolled 691 patients into two studies for ovulation induction (454 patients) and two studies for ART (237 patients).



 Adverse events occurring in more than 10% of patients were headache, ovarian cyst, nausea, and upper respiratory tract infection in the U.S. ovulation induction study and headache in the U.S. ART study. Adverse events (without regard to causality assessment) occurring in at least 2% of patients are listed in Table 13 and Table 14.

         Additional adverse events not listed in Table 14 that occurred in 1 to 2% of Gonal-f  (r)  treated patients in the U.S. Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) study included the following: D&amp;C following delivery or abortion, dysmenorrhea, vaginal hemorrhage, diarrhea, tooth disorder, vomiting, dizziness, paraesthesia, abdomen enlarged, chest pain, fatigue, dyspnea, anorexia, anxiety, somnolence, injection site inflammation, injection site reaction, pruritus, pruritus genital, myalgia, thirst, and palpitation.
 

 Two additional clinical studies (for ovulation induction and ART, respectively) were conducted in Europe. The safety profiles from these two studies were comparable to that of the data presented above.



 Gonal-f  (r)  Multi-Dose was examined in twenty-five healthy volunteers who received 300 IU each of Gonal-f  (r)  from single- dose ampules and multi-dose vials. Overall, both presentations were well tolerated and local tolerability between the two groups was comparable. Injection site inspections revealed very rare local reactions (mild redness in one patient after single-dose injection and mild bruising in two subjects after multi-dose injection). Subjective assessments indicated minimal or mild transient pain in two and five subjects who received Gonal-f  (r)  single-dose and Gonal-f  (r)  multi-dose, respectively.



 The following medical events have been reported subsequent to pregnancies resulting from gonadotropins in controlled clinical studies:



 *  Spontaneous Abortion 
 *  Ectopic Pregnancy 
 *  Premature Labor 
 *  Postpartum Fever 
 *  Congenital Abnormalities 
    Two incidents of congenital cardiac malformations have been reported in children born following pregnancies resulting from treatment with Gonal-f  (r)  and hCG in Gonal-f  (r)  clinical studies 5642 and 5727. In addition, a pregnancy occurring in study 5533 following treatment with Gonal-f  (r)  and hCG was complicated by apparent failure of intrauterine growth and terminated for a suspected syndrome of congenital abnormalities. No specific diagnosis was made. The incidence does not exceed that found in the general population.
 

 The following adverse reactions have been previously reported during menotropin therapy:



 *  Pulmonary and vascular complications (see "  Warnings  "), 
 *  Adnexal torsion (as a complication of ovarian enlargement), 
 *  Mild to moderate ovarian enlargement, 
 *  Hemoperitoneum 
    There have been infrequent reports of ovarian neoplasms, both benign and malignant, in women who have undergone multiple drug regimens for ovulation induction; however, a causal relationship has not been established.
 

   Men

  The safety of Gonal-f  (r)  was examined in 3 clinical studies that enrolled 72 patients for induction of spermatogenesis and fertility of whom 56 patients received Gonal-f  (r)  . One hundred and twenty-three adverse events, including 7 serious events, were reported in 34 of the 56 patients during Gonal-f  (r)  treatment.



 In Study 5844, 21 adverse events, including 4 serious adverse events, were reported by 14 of the 26 patients (53.8%) treated with Gonal-f  (r)  . Events occurring in more than one patient were varicocele (4) and injection site reactions (4). The 4 serious adverse events were testicular surgery for cryptorchidism, which existed prestudy, hemoptysis, an infected pilonidal cyst, and lymphadenopathy associated with an Epstein-Barr viral infection.



 In Study 6410, 3 adverse events were reported in 2 of the 8 patients (24%) treated with Gonal-f  (r)  . One serious adverse event was reported, surgery for gynecomastia which existed at baseline.



 In the interim analysis of Study 6793, 18 of 22 patients (81.8%) reported a total of 99 adverse events during Gonal-f  (r)  treatment. The most common events of possible, probable, or definite relationship to study drug therapy occurring in more than 2 patients were: acne (25 events in 13 patients; 59% of patients); breast pain (4 events in 3 patients; 13.6% of patients); and fatigue, gynecomastia, and injection site pain (each of which was reported as 2 events by 2 patients; 9.1% of patients). Two serious adverse events (hospitalization for drug abuse and depression) were reported by a single patient in the interim analysis.



 A total of 12,026 injections of Gonal-f  (r)  were administered by the 56 patients who received Gonal-f  (r)  in Studies 5844, 6410, and 6793 combined. The injections were well-tolerated, with no or mild reactions (redness, swelling, bruising and itching) reported by patients for 93.3% of injections. Moderate and severe reactions, consisting primarily of pain, were reported for 4.8% of injections, and no self-assessment was available for 1.9% of injections.



   Postmarketing Experience

  In addition to adverse events reported from clinical trials, the following events have been reported during postmarketing use of Gonal-f  (r)  . Because these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, the frequency or a causal relationship to Gonal-f  (r)  , can not be reliably determined.

   General



  Careful attention should be given to the diagnosis of infertility in candidates for Gonal-f  (r)  (follitropin alfa for injection) therapy (see "  Indications and Usage/ Selection of Patients  ").



    Information for Patients



  Prior to therapy with Gonal-f  (r)  , patients should be informed of the duration of treatment and monitoring of their condition that will be required. The risks of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and multiple births in women (see "   WARNINGS    ") and other possible adverse reactions (see "   Adverse Reactions    ") should also be discussed.



 A 'Patient's Information Leaflet' is provided for patients prescribed Gonal-f  (r)  Multi-Dose.



    Laboratory Tests



  In most instances, treatment of women with Gonal-f  (r)  results only in follicular recruitment and development. In the absence of an endogenous LH surge, hCG is given when monitoring of the patient indicates that sufficient follicular development has occurred. This may be estimated by ultrasound alone or in combination with measurement of serum estradiol levels. The combination of both ultrasound and serum estradiol measurement are useful for monitoring the development of follicles, for timing of the ovulatory trigger, as well as for detecting ovarian enlargement and minimizing the risk of the Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome and multiple gestation. It is recommended that the number of growing follicles be confirmed using ultrasonography because plasma estrogens do not give an indication of the size or number of follicles.



 The clinical confirmation of ovulation, with the exception of pregnancy, is obtained by direct and indirect indices of progesterone production. The indices most generally used are as follows:



 *  A rise in basal body temperature; 
 *  Increase in serum progesterone; and 
 *  Menstruation following a shift in basal body temperature. 
    When used in conjunction with the indices of progesterone production, sonographic visualization of the ovaries will assist in determining if ovulation has occurred. Sonographic evidence of ovulation may include the following:
 

 *  Fluid in the cul-de-sac; 
 *  Ovarian stigmata; 
 *  Collapsed follicle; and 
 *  Secretory endometrium. 
    Accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle development and maturation require a physician who is experienced in the interpretation of these tests.
 

    Drug Interactions



  No drug/drug interaction studies have been performed.



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility



  Long- term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of Gonal-f  (r)  . However, follitropin alfa showed no mutagenic activity in a series of tests performed to evaluate its potential genetic toxicity including, bacterial and mammalian cell mutation tests, a chromosomal aberration test and a micronucleus test.



 Impaired fertility has been reported in rats, exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa (&gt;=40 IU/kg/day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity.



    Pregnancy



  See   CONTRAINDICATIONS  .  



    Nursing Mothers



  It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the nursing infant from Gonal-f  (r)  , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.



    Pediatric Use



  Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings">    WARNINGS



  Gonal-f  (r)  (follitropin alfa for injection) should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their management.



 Gonal-f  (r)  is a potent gonadotropic substance capable of causing Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) in women with or without pulmonary or vascular complications. Gonadotropin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health professionals, and requires the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities (see "  Precautions/Laboratory Tests  "). Safe and effective use of Gonal-f  (r)  in women requires monitoring of ovarian response with serum estradiol and vaginal ultrasound on a regular basis. The lowest effective dose should be used.



    Overstimulation of the Ovary During FSH Therapy



   Ovarian Enlargement



  Mild to moderate uncomplicated ovarian enlargement which may be accompanied by abdominal distention and/or abdominal pain occurs in approximately 20% of those treated with urofollitropin and hCG, and generally regresses without treatment within two or three weeks. Careful monitoring of ovarian response can further minimize the risk of overstimulation.



 If the ovaries are abnormally enlarged on the last day of Gonal-f  (r)  therapy, hCG should not be administered in this course of therapy. This will reduce the chances of development of Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome.



    Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS)



  OHSS is a medical event distinct from uncomplicated ovarian enlargement. Severe OHSS may progress rapidly (within 24 hours to several days) to become a serious medical event. It is characterized by an apparent dramatic increase in vascular permeability which can result in a rapid accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity, thorax, and potentially, the pericardium. The early warning signs of development of OHSS are severe pelvic pain, nausea, vomiting, and weight gain. The following symptomatology has been seen with cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal distension, gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnea, and oliguria. Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolemia, hemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, hemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, hydrothorax, acute pulmonary distress, and thromboembolic events (see "  Pulmonary and Vascular Complications  "). Transient liver function test abnormalities suggestive of hepatic dysfunction, which may be accompanied by morphologic changes on liver biopsy, have been reported in association with Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS). OHSS occurred in 9 of 228 (3.9%) Gonal-f  (r)  treated women during ovulation induction clinical trials and of this number, 1 of 228 (0.4%) was classified as severe. In ART clinical studies, OHSS occurred in 0 of 116 (0.0%) Gonal-f  (r)  treated women. OHSS may be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. OHSS develops rapidly; therefore, patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG administration. Most often, OHSS occurs after treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment. Usually, OHSS resolves spontaneously with the onset of menses. If there is evidence that OHSS may be developing prior to hCG administration (see "  Precautions/Laboratory Tests  "), the hCG must  be withheld.



 If severe OHSS occurs, treatment must  be stopped and the patient should be hospitalized.



 A physician experienced in the management of this syndrome, or who is experienced in the management of fluid and electrolyte imbalances should be consulted.



    Pulmonary and Vascular Complications



  Serious pulmonary conditions (e.g., atelectasis, acute respiratory distress syndrome and exacerbation of asthma) have been reported. In addition, thromboembolic events both in association with, and separate from Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome have been reported with gonadotropins including Gonal-f  (r)  . Intravascular thrombosis and embolism can result in reduced blood flow to critical organs or the extremities. Sequelae of such events have included venous thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary infarction, cerebral vascular occlusion (stroke), and arterial occlusion resulting in loss of limb. In rare cases, pulmonary complications and/or thromboembolic events have resulted in death.



    Multiple Births



  Reports of multiple births have been associated with Gonal-f  (r)  treatment. In ovulation induction clinical trials, 12.3% of live births were multiple births in women receiving Gonal-f  (r)  and 14.5% of live births were multiple births in women receiving urofollitropin. In IVF/ET clinical trials, 44.0% of live births were multiple births in women receiving Gonal-f  (r)  and 41.0% of live births were multiple births in women receiving urofollitropin and is dependent on the number of embryos transferred. The patient should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment.
