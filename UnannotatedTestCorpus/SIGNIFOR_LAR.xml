  6.1     Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



   Drug-Naive Patients with Acromegaly  



 The data described in Table 1 are derived from an active-controlled trial in patients with acromegaly naive to previous drug therapy  [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]  . The data reflect exposure of 178 patients with acromegaly to SIGNIFOR LAR for a mean duration of 43 weeks. In the overall study population, 52% were female and the average age of patients was 45 years.



 Table 1 presents common adverse reactions associated with SIGNIFOR LAR. These adverse reactions were not present at baseline or, if present, worsened from baseline and occurred in at least 5% of patients treated with SIGNIFOR LAR.

   Pancreatic Enzyme Elevation and Pancreatitis  



 Asymptomatic elevations in lipase and alpha amylase were observed in 30% and 20% of patients receiving SIGNIFOR LAR in the drug naive study in acromegaly, and in 1% and 3% of patients receiving SIGNIFOR LAR in the study of acromegaly patients previously treated. In the drug-naive study, 2 acromegaly patients receiving SIGNIFOR LAR developed pancreatitis. In the Cushing's disease study, increased lipase was observed in 4% of patients, and 1 patient developed pancreatitis. Pancreatitis is a potential adverse reaction associated with the use of SIGNIFOR LAR due to the association between cholelithiasis and acute pancreatitis.

   EXCERPT:    *   Hyperglycemia and Diabetes: Sometimes severe. Monitor glucose levels periodically during therapy. Monitor glucose levels more frequently in the months that follow initiation or discontinuation of SIGNIFOR LAR therapy and following SIGNIFOR LAR dose adjustment. Use antidiabetic treatment if indicated per standard of care. (  2.1  ,  5.1  ) 
 *   Bradycardia and QT Prolongation: Use with caution in at-risk patients; Evaluate ECG and electrolytes prior to dosing and periodically while on treatment. (  2.1  ,  5.2  ,  7.1  ) 
 *   Liver Test Elevations: Evaluate liver enzyme tests prior to and during treatment. (  2.1  ,  5.3  ) 
 *   Cholelithiasis: Monitor periodically. (  5.4  ) 
 *   Pituitary Hormone Deficiency(ies): Monitor for occurrence periodically and treat if clinically indicated. (  5.5  ) 
    
 

   5.1     Hyperglycemia and Diabetes



   SIGNIFOR LAR can cause increases in blood glucose levels which are sometimes severe. In the study of patients with acromegaly, 5 patients naive to drug therapy exposed to SIGNIFOR LAR (2 of whom were normoglycemic at baseline) were hospitalized for blood glucose in the range of 359-506 mg/dL and none in the active comparator group. Two additional patients who had received active comparator in the main trial and were switched to SIGNIFOR LAR in the extension trial, were hospitalized for elevated glucose levels while on SIGNIFOR LAR treatment during the extension; 1 of those patients developed diabetic ketoacidosis. In the Cushing's disease study, two patients were hospitalized for elevated blood glucose. Patients with poor baseline glycemic control are at higher risk of developing severe hyperglycemia [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]  .  



  In clinical studies for acromegaly and Cushing's disease, treatment with SIGNIFOR LAR caused an increase in the incidence of diabetes and prediabetes. A majority of patients, including those with normal glucose tolerance, prediabetes and diabetes, experienced increased glucose levels within the first 3 months of treatment with SIGNIFOR LAR [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]  . In the drug-naive acromegaly study, the prevalence of diabetes increased from 30% at baseline to 60% at Month 12. In the study evaluating acromegaly patients previously treated with somatostatin analogs, the prevalence of diabetes increased from 71% at baseline to 87% at Month 6 in patients treated with SIGNIFOR LAR 40 mg, and from 60% to 84% in patients treated with SIGNIFOR LAR 60 mg. In the Cushing's disease study, the prevalence of diabetes increased from 40% at baseline to 56% at Month 12.  



  Fasting plasma glucose and hemoglobin A1c should be assessed prior to starting treatment with SIGNIFOR LAR. In patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, anti-diabetic treatment should be optimized per standard of care before SIGNIFOR LAR treatment is started. Blood glucose monitoring should be done weekly for the first 3 months after initiating SIGNIFOR LAR and the first 4 to 6 weeks after dose increases. Periodic monitoring should continue thereafter, as clinically appropriate.  



 Patients who develop significant hyperglycemia on SIGNIFOR LAR may require initiation of antidiabetic therapy or adjustment in their current antidiabetic therapy per standard of care. The optimal treatment for the management of SIGNIFOR LAR-induced hyperglycemia is not known. If hyperglycemia cannot be controlled despite medical management, the dose of SIGNIFOR LAR should be reduced or SIGNIFOR LAR should be discontinued.



 After treatment discontinuation, fasting plasma glucose and hemoglobin A1c should be assessed if indicated. Patients on antidiabetic therapy discontinuing SIGNIFOR LAR may require more frequent blood glucose monitoring and antidiabetic drug therapy dose adjustment to mitigate the risk of hypoglycemia.



    5.2     Bradycardia and QT Prolongation



   Bradycardia  



 Bradycardia has been reported with the use of SIGNIFOR LAR [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]  . Patients with cardiac disease and/or risk factors for bradycardia, such as history of clinically significant bradycardia, high-grade heart block, or concomitant use of drugs associated with bradycardia, should be monitored. Adjustments in the dose of drugs known to slow the heart rate (e.g., beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers) and correction of electrolyte disturbances may be necessary when initiating or during the course of SIGNIFOR LAR treatment.



  QT Prolongation  



 In cardiac electrophysiology studies (i.e., thorough QT studies) with pasireotide via subcutaneous route, QT prolongation occurred at therapeutic and supra-therapeutic doses [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]  .



 In the clinical studies, a corrected QT interval (i.e., QTcF) of greater than 480 ms was reported in six patients and an increase in the QTcF from baseline of greater than 60 ms was reported for seven patients on SIGNIFOR LAR. No patient on SIGNIFOR LAR had a QTcF value of greater than 500 ms [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].  



 SIGNIFOR LAR should be used with caution in patients who are at significant risk of developing prolongation of the QT interval, such as those listed below:



 *  with congenital long QT prolongation 
 *  with uncontrolled or significant cardiac disease including recent myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, unstable angina or clinically significant bradycardia 
 *  on antiarrhythmic therapy or other substances that are known to lead to QT prolongation 
 *  with hypokalemia and/or hypomagnesemia 
    A baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) is recommended prior to initiating therapy with SIGNIFOR LAR. Monitoring for an effect on the QT interval at the time of maximum drug concentration (21 days after injection) should be obtained in patients at risk. Hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia must be corrected prior to initiating SIGNIFOR LAR and should be monitored periodically during therapy.
 

    5.3     Liver Test Elevations



  Increases in liver enzymes have been observed with SIGNIFOR LAR. In all Phase 3 acromegaly studies and across all doses, alanine aminostranferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevations greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were observed in 4% of acromegaly patients and ALT or AST elevations greater than 5 times the ULN were observed in 1% of acromegaly patients treated with SIGNIFOR LAR.



 In the Phase 3 Cushing's Disease study and across all doses, alanine aminostranferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were observed in 14% of Cushing's Disease patients and ALT or AST elevations greater than five times the ULN were observed in 5% of Cushing's Disease patients treated with SIGNIFOR LAR.



 Assessment of liver function is recommended prior to treatment with SIGNIFOR LAR , and after the first 2 to 3 weeks, then monthly for 3 months. Thereafter, liver function should be monitored as clinically indicated. Patients who develop increased transaminase levels should be monitored until values return to pretreatment levels. Treatment with SIGNIFOR LAR should be discontinued if signs or symptoms suggestive of clinically significant liver impairment develop. Following discontinuation of treatment with SIGNIFOR LAR, patients should be monitored until resolution. Treatment should not be restarted, if the liver function abnormalities are suspected to be related to SIGNIFOR LAR.



    5.4     Cholelithiasis



   Cholelithiasis was reported in 33% of drug-naive and 10% of inadequately controlled (40 mg dose) acromegaly patients treated with SIGNIFOR LAR in clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions (6)]  . Cholelithiasis was reported in 33% of Cushing's disease patients treated with SIGNIFOR LAR. Patients should be monitored periodically.  



    5.5     Pituitary Hormone Deficiency(ies)



  Suppression of anterior pituitary hormones may occur on SIGNIFOR LAR. Monitoring pituitary function (e.g., thyroid, adrenal, gonadal) prior to initiation of therapy with SIGNIFOR LAR, as well as periodically during treatment, as clinically appropriate, is recommended. Patients should be monitored for and instructed on the signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency during therapy. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, it should be confirmed and treated per standard of care with exogenous glucocorticoids at replacement doses.
