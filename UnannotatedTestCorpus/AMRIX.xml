    Most Common Adverse Reactions in the AMRIX Clinical Trials  



 Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 The data described below reflect exposure to AMRIX in 253 patients in 2 clinical trials. AMRIX was studied in two double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, active-controlled trials of identical design    [see Clinical Studies (14)]    . The study population was composed of patients with muscle spasms associated with acute painful musculoskeletal conditions. Patients received 15 mg or 30 mg of AMRIX taken orally once daily, cyclobenzaprine immediate-release (IR) 10 mg three times a day, or placebo for 14 days.



 The most common adverse reactions (incidence &gt;=3% in any treatment group and greater than placebo) were dry mouth, dizziness, fatigue, constipation, nausea, dyspepsia, and somnolence (see Table 1).

   Additional Adverse Reactions from Clinical Studies and Postmarketing Experience  



 The following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical studies or postmarketing experience with AMRIX, cyclobenzaprine IR, or tricyclic drugs. Because some of these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 In a postmarketing surveillance program of cyclobenzaprine IR, the adverse reactions reported most frequently were drowsiness, dry mouth, and dizziness and adverse reactions reported in 1% to 3% of the patients were: fatigue/tiredness, asthenia, nausea, constipation, dyspepsia, unpleasant taste, blurred vision, headache, nervousness, and confusion.



 The following adverse reactions have been reported in postmarketing experience (AMRIX or cyclobenzaprine IR), in clinical studies of cyclobenzaprine IR (incidence &lt;1%), or in postmarketing experience with other tricyclic drugs:

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Serotonin syndrome has been reported with cyclobenzaprine when used in combination with other serotonergic drugs (  5.1  ) 
 *  Cyclobenzaprine is structurally related to tricyclic antidepressants which have been reported to produce adverse cardiovascular effects or CNS depressant effects (  5.2  ) 
 *  Use in the elderly is not recommended (  5.3  ) 
 *  Use in patients with hepatic impairment is not recommended (  5.4  ) 
 *  Use with caution in patients with a history of urinary retention, angle-closure glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure and in patients taking anticholinergic medications (  5.5  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Serotonin Syndrome



  The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome has been reported with cyclobenzaprine when used in combination with other drugs, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), tramadol, bupropion, meperidine, verapamil, or MAO inhibitors. The concomitant use of AMRIX with MAO inhibitors is contraindicated   [see Contraindications (4)]  .  Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., confusion, agitation, hallucinations), autonomic instability (e.g., diaphoresis, tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular abnormalities (e.g., tremor, ataxia, hyperreflexia, clonus, muscle rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Treatment with AMRIX and any concomitant serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately if the above reactions occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated. If concomitant treatment with AMRIX and other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, careful observation is advised, particularly during treatment initiation or dose increases.



    5.2 Tricyclic Antidepressant-like Effects



  Cyclobenzaprine is structurally related to the tricyclic antidepressants, e.g., amitriptyline and imipramine. Tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to produce arrhythmias, sinus tachycardia, prolongation of the conduction time leading to myocardial infarction and stroke   [see Contraindications (4)]    . AMRIX may enhance the effects of alcohol, barbiturates, and other CNS depressants.



 Some of the more serious central nervous system (CNS) reactions noted with the tricyclic antidepressants have occurred in short-term studies of cyclobenzaprine for indications other than muscle spasm associated with acute musculoskeletal conditions, and usually at doses somewhat greater than those recommended for skeletal muscle spasm. If clinically significant CNS symptoms develop, consider discontinuation of AMRIX.



    5.3 Use in the Elderly



  As a result of a 40% increase in cyclobenzaprine plasma levels and a 56% increase in plasma half-life following administration of AMRIX in elderly subjects as compared to young adults, use of AMRIX is not recommended in the elderly  [  see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ].  



    5.4 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment



  As a result of two-fold higher cyclobenzaprine plasma levels in subjects with mild hepatic impairment, as compared to healthy subjects, following administration of immediate-release cyclobenzaprine and because there is limited dosing flexibility with AMRIX, use of AMRIX is not recommended in patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment  [  see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ].  



    5.5 Atropine-like Action



  Because of its atropine-like action, AMRIX should be used with caution in patients with a history of urinary retention, angle-closure glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and in patients taking anticholinergic medication.
