  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed during the clinical trials performed with one somatropin product cannot always be directly compared to the rates observed during the clinical trials performed with another somatropin product, and may not reflect the adverse reaction rates observed in practice.



   Pediatric Patients  



   Growth Failure due to Inadequate Secretion of Endogenous Growth Hormone  



 In one randomized, open label, clinical study the most frequent adverse reactions were headache, pharyngitis, otitis media and fever. There were no clinically significant differences between the three doses assessed in the study (0.025, 0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg/day).



   Short Stature Associated with Noonan Syndrome  



 NORDITROPIN    was studied in 21 pediatric patients, 3 years to 14 years of age at doses of 0.033 mg/kg/day and 0.066 mg/kg/day. After the two-year study, patients continued NORDITROPIN    treatment until final height was achieved; randomized dose groups were not maintained. Adverse reactions were later collected retrospectively from 18 pediatric patients; total follow-up was 11 years. An additional 6 pediatric patients were not randomized, but followed the protocol and are included in this assessment of adverse reactions.



 The most frequent adverse reactions were upper respiratory infection, gastroenteritis, ear infection, and influenza. Cardiac disorders was the system organ class with the second most adverse reactions reported. Scoliosis was reported in 1 and 4 pediatric patients receiving doses of 0.033 mg/kg/day and 0.066 mg/kg/day respectively. The following additional adverse reactions also occurred once: insulin resistance and panic reaction for the 0.033 mg/kg/day dose group; injection site pruritus, bone development abnormal, depression, and self-injurious ideation in the 0.066 mg/kg/day dose group. Headache occurred in 2 cases in the 0.066 mg/kg/day dose group.



   Short Stature Associated with Turner Syndrome  



 In two clinical studies in pediatric patients that were treated until final height with various doses of NORDITROPIN, the most frequently reported adverse reactions were influenza-like illness, otitis media, upper respiratory tract infection, otitis externa, gastroenteritis, eczema and, impaired fasting glucose. Adverse reactions in study 1 were most frequent in the highest dose groups. Three patients in study 1 had excessive growth of hands and/or feet in the high dose groups. Two patients in study 1 had a serious adverse reaction of exacerbation of preexisting scoliosis in the 0.045 mg/kg/day group.



   Small for Gestational Age (SGA) with No Catch-up Growth by Age 2-4 Years  



 In a study, 53 pediatric patients were treated with 2 doses of NORDITROPIN    (0.033 or 0.067 mg/kg/day) to final height for up to 13 years (mean duration of treatment 7.9 and 9.5 years for girls and boys, respectively). The most frequently reported adverse reactions were influenza-like illness, upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, gastroenteritis, abdominal pain, otitis media, pharyngitis, arthralgia, headache, gynecomastia, and increased sweating. One pediatric patient treated with 0.067 mg/kg/day for 4 years was reported with disproportionate growth of the lower jaw, and another patient treated with 0.067 mg/kg/day developed a melanocytic nevus. 4 pediatric patients treated with 0.067 mg/kg/day and 2 pediatric patients treated with 0.033 mg/kg/day of NORDITROPIN had increased fasting blood glucose levels after 1 year of treatment. In addition, small increases in mean fasting blood glucose and insulin levels after 1 and 2 years of NORDITROPIN treatment appeared to be dose-dependent.



 In a second study, 98 Japanese pediatric patients were treated with 2 doses of NORDITROPIN    (0.033 or 0.067 mg/kg/day) for 2 years or were untreated for 1 year. Adverse reactions were otitis media, arthralgia and impaired glucose tolerance. Arthralgia and transiently impaired glucose tolerance were reported in the 0.067 mg/kg/day treatment group.



   Idiopathic Short Stature  



 In two open-label clinical studies with another somatropin product in pediatric patients, the most common adverse reactions were upper respiratory tract infections, influenza, tonsillitis, nasopharyngitis, gastroenteritis, headaches, increased appetite, pyrexia, fracture, altered mood, and arthralgia.



   Growth Failure Due to Prader-Willi Syndrome  



 In two clinical studies in pediatric patients with PWS carried out with another somatropin product, the following adverse reactions were reported: edema, aggressiveness, arthralgia, benign intracranial hypertension, hair loss, headache, and myalgia.

           6.2 Immunogenicity
   As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to NORDITROPIN    with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. In the case of growth hormone, antibodies with binding capacities lower than 2 mg/mL have not been associated with growth attenuation. In a very small number of patients treated with somatropin, when binding capacity was greater than 2 mg/mL, interference with the growth response was observed.



 In clinical trials, GH deficient pediatric patients receiving NORDITROPIN    for up to 12 months were tested for induction of antibodies, and 0/358 patients developed antibodies with binding capacities above 2 mg/L. Amongst these patients, 165 had previously been treated with other somatropin formulations, and 193 were previously untreated naive patients. Eighteen of 76 children (~24%) treated with NORDITROPIN    for short stature born SGA developed anti-rhGH antibodies.



   6.3 Post-Marketing Experience

  Because these adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Immune system disorders  - Serious systemic hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and angioedema



   Skin  - Increase in size or number of cutaneous nevi



   Endocrine disorders  - Hypothyroidism



   Metabolism and nutrition disorders  - Hyperglycemia



   Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders  -    Slipped capital femoral epiphysis    - Legg-Calve-Perthes disease



   Investigations  - Increase in blood alkaline phosphatase level - Decrease in serum thyroxin (T4) levels



   Gastrointestinal  - Pancreatitis



   Neoplasm  - Leukemia has been reported in a small number of GH deficient children treated with somatropin, somatrem (methionylated rhGH) and GH of pituitary origin

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *     Increased Risk of Neoplasms : Second neoplasms have occurred in childhood cancer survivors. Monitor patients with preexisting tumors for progression or recurrence. (  5.3  ) 
 *     Glucose Intolerance and Diabetes Mellitus : NORDITROPIN may decrease insulin sensitivity, particularly at higher doses. Monitor glucose levels periodically in all patients receiving NORDITROPIN, especially in patients with existing diabetes mellitus or at risk for development. (  5.4  ) 
 *     Intracranial Hypertension (IH) : Has been reported usually within 8 weeks of initiation. Perform fundoscopic examinations prior to initiation and periodically thereafter. If papilledema occurs, stop treatment. (  5.5  ) 
 *     Severe Hypersensitivity : Serious hypersensitivity reactions may occur. In the event of an allergic reaction, seek prompt medical attention. (  5.6  ) 
 *     Fluid Retention : May occur in adults and may be dose dependent. (  5.7  ) 
 *     Hypoadrenalism : Monitor patients for reduced serum cortisol levels and/or need for glucocorticoid dose increases in those with known hypoadrenalism. (  5.8  ) 
 *     Hypothyroidism : Monitor thyroid function periodically as hypothyroidism may occur or worsen after initiation of somatropin. (  5.9  ) 
 *     Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis in Pediatric Patients : May occur; evaluate patients with onset of a limp or hip/knee pain. (  5.10  ) 
 *     Progression of Preexisting Scoliosis in Pediatric Patients : Monitor patients with scoliosis for progression. (  5.11  ) 
 *     Pancreatitis : Has been reported; consider pancreatitis in patients with abdominal pain, especially pediatric patients. (  5.12  ) 
    
 

    5.1 Increased Mortality in Patients with Acute Critical Illness  



  Increased mortality in patients with acute critical illness due to complications following open heart surgery, abdominal surgery or multiple accidental trauma, or those with acute respiratory failure has been reported after treatment with pharmacologic amounts of somatropin [see  Contraindications (4)  ]  . Two placebo-controlled clinical trials in non-growth hormone deficient adult patients (n=522) with these conditions in intensive care units revealed a significant increase in mortality (42% vs. 19%) among somatropin-treated patients (doses 5.3-8 mg/day) compared to those receiving placebo. The safety of continuing NORDITROPIN   treatment in patients receiving replacement doses for approved indications who concurrently develop these illnesses has not been established. NORDITROPIN is not indicated for the treatment of non-GH deficient adults.  



     5.2 Sudden Death in Pediatric Patients with Prader-Willi Syndrome  



  There have been reports of sudden death after initiating therapy with somatropin in pediatric patients with Prader-Willi syndrome who had one or more of the following risk factors: severe obesity, history of upper airway obstruction or sleep apnea, or unidentified respiratory infection. Male patients with one or more of these factors may be at greater risk than females. Patients with Prader-Willi syndrome should be evaluated for signs of upper airway obstruction and sleep apnea before initiation of treatment with somatropin. If, during treatment with NORDITROPIN, patients show signs of upper airway obstruction (including onset of or increased snoring) and/or new onset sleep apnea, treatment should be interrupted. All patients with Prader-Willi syndrome treated with NORDITROPIN   should also have effective weight control and be monitored for signs of respiratory infection, which should be diagnosed as early as possible and treated aggressively [see  Contraindications (4)  ]  .



    5.3 Increased Risk of Neoplasms



   Active Malignancy  



  There is an increased risk of malignancy progression with somatropin treatment in patients with active malignancy [See  Contraindications (4)  ]  . Any preexisting malignancy should be inactive and its treatment complete prior to instituting therapy with NORDITROPIN. Discontinue NORDITROPIN if there is evidence of recurrent activity.  



  Risk of Second Neoplasm in Pediatric Patients  



  There is an increased risk of a second neoplasm in pediatric cancer survivors who were treated with radiation to the brain/head and who developed subsequent GH deficiency and were treated with somatropin. Intracranial tumors, in particular meningiomas, were the most common of these second neoplasms. In adults, it is unknown whether there is any relationship between somatropin replacement therapy and CNS tumor recurrence. Monitor all patients receiving NORDITROPIN who have a history of GH deficiency secondary to an intracranial neoplasm for progression or recurrence of the tumor.  



  New Malignancy During Treatment  



  Because pediatric patients with certain rare genetic causes of short stature have an increased risk of developing malignancies, thoroughly consider the risks and benefits of starting NORDITROPIN in these patients. If NORDITROPIN is initiated, carefully monitor patients for development of neoplasms.  



  Monitor all patients receiving NORDITROPIN carefully for increased growth, or potential malignant changes, of preexisting nevi. Advise patients/caregivers to report marked changes in behavior, onset of headaches, vision disturbances and/or changes in skin pigmentation or changes in the appearance of pre-existing nevi.  



    5.4 Glucose Intolerance and Diabetes Mellitus



   Treatment with somatropin may decrease insulin sensitivity, particularly at higher doses. New onset type 2 diabetes mellitus has been reported in patients taking somatropin. Previously undiagnosed impaired glucose tolerance and overt diabetes mellitus may be unmasked. Monitor glucose levels periodically in all patients receiving NORDITROPIN, especially in those with risk factors for diabetes mellitus, such as obesity, Turner syndrome, or a family history of diabetes mellitus. Patients with preexisting type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance should be monitored closely. The doses of antidiabetic agents may require adjustment when NORDITROPIN is initiated.  



    5.5 Intracranial Hypertension



  Intracranial hypertension (IH) with papilledema, visual changes, headache, nausea, and/or vomiting has been reported in a small number of patients treated with somatropin products. Symptoms usually occurred within the first eight (8) weeks after the initiation of somatropin therapy. In all reported cases, IH-associated signs and symptoms rapidly resolved after cessation of therapy or a reduction of the somatropin dose. Funduscopic examination should be performed routinely before initiating treatment with NORDITROPIN to exclude preexisting papilledema, and periodically thereafter.  If papilledema is observed by funduscopy during somatropin treatment, treatment should be stopped. If somatropin-induced IH is diagnosed, treatment with NORDITROPIN   can be restarted at a lower dose after IH-associated signs and symptoms have resolved. Patients with Turner syndrome may be at increased risk for the development of IH.



     5.6 Severe Hypersensitivity  



  Serious systemic hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and angioedema have been reported with postmarketing use of somatropin products. Patients and caregivers should be informed that such reactions are possible and that prompt medical attention should be sought if an allergic reaction occurs [see  Contraindications (4)  ].  



    5.7 Fluid Retention



  Fluid retention during somatropin replacement therapy in adults may frequently occur. Clinical manifestations of fluid retention (e.g. edema, arthralgia, myalgia, nerve compression syndromes including carpal tunnel syndrome/paraesthesias) are usually transient and dose dependent.



    5.8 Hypoadrenalism



  Patients receiving somatropin therapy who have or are at risk for pituitary hormone deficiency(s) may be at risk for reduced serum cortisol levels and/or unmasking of central (secondary) hypoadrenalism. In addition, patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses following initiation of NORDITROPIN   treatment. Monitor patients for reduced serum cortisol levels and/or need for glucocorticoid dose increases in those with known hypoadrenalism [see  Drug Interactions (7)       ].  



    5.9 Hypothyroidism



   Undiagnosed/untreated hypothyroidism may prevent an optimal response to NORDITROPIN, in particular, the growth response in pediatric patients. Patients with Turner syndrome have an inherently increased risk of developing autoimmune thyroid disease and primary hypothyroidism.  In patients with GH deficiency, central (secondary) hypothyroidism may first become evident or worsen during somatropin treatment. Therefore, patients should have periodic thyroid function tests and thyroid hormone replacement therapy should be initiated or appropriately adjusted when indicated.



     5.10 Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis in Pediatric Patients  



   Slipped capital femoral epiphysis may occur more frequently in patients with endocrine disorders (including GH deficiency and Turner syndrome) or in patients undergoing rapid growth. Evaluate pediatric patients with the onset of a limp or complaints of hip or knee pain.  



     5.11 Progression of Preexisting Scoliosis in Pediatric Patients  



   Somatropin increases the growth rate, and progression of existing scoliosis can occur in patients who experience rapid growth. Somatropin has not been shown to increase the occurrence of scoliosis. Monitor patients with a history of scoliosis for progression of scoliosis.  



     5.12 Pancreatitis  



   Cases of pancreatitis have been reported in pediatric patients and adults receiving somatropin products. There may be a greater risk in pediatric patients compared with adults. Published literature indicates that females who have Turner syndrome may be at greater risk than other pediatric patients receiving somatropin products. Pancreatitis should be considered in patients who develop persistent severe abdominal pain.  



     5.13 Lipoatrophy  



   When somatropin products are administered subcutaneously at the same site over a long period of time, tissue atrophy may result. Rotate injection sites when administering NORDITROPIN to reduce this risk [see  Administration and Use Instructions (2.1)  ]  .  



     5.14 Laboratory Tests  



   Serum levels of inorganic phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and IGF-I may increase after NORDITROPIN treatment.
