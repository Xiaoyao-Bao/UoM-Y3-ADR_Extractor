  Diazepam rectal gel adverse event data were collected from double-blind, placebo-controlled studies and open-label studies. The majority of adverse events were mild to moderate in severity and transient in nature.



 Two patients who received Diazepam rectal gel died seven to 15 weeks following treatment; neither of these deaths was deemed related to Diazepam rectal gel.



 The most frequent adverse event reported to be related to Diazepam rectal gel in the two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies was somnolence (23%). Less frequent adverse events were dizziness, headache, pain, abdominal pain, nervousness, vasodilatation, diarrhea, ataxia, euphoria, incoordination, asthma, rhinitis, and rash, which occurred in approximately 2-5% of patients.



 Approximately 1.4% of the 573 patients who received Diazepam rectal gel in clinical trials of epilepsy discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. The adverse event most frequently associated with discontinuation (occurring in three patients) was somnolence. Other adverse events most commonly associated with discontinuation and occurring in two patients were hypoventilation and rash. Adverse events occurring in one patient were asthenia, hyperkinesia, incoordination, vasodilatation and urticaria. These events were judged to be related to diazepam rectal gel.



 In the two domestic double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies, the proportion of patients who discontinued treatment because of adverse events was 2% for the group treated with Diazepam rectal gel, versus 2% for the placebo group. In the Diazepam rectal gel group, the adverse events considered the primary reason for discontinuation were different in the two patients who discontinued treatment; one discontinued due to rash and one discontinued due to lethargy. The primary reason for discontinuation in the patients treated with placebo was lack of effect.



   Adverse Event Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials

  Table 1 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in &gt; 1% of patients enrolled in parallel-group, placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common in the Diazepam rectal gel group. Adverse events were usually mild or moderate in intensity.



 The prescriber should be aware that these figures, obtained when Diazepam rectal gel was added to concurrent antiepileptic drug therapy, cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice when patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those prevailing during clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be directly compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, or investigators. An inspection of these frequencies, however, does provide the prescribing physician with one basis to estimate the relative contribution of drug and non-drug factors to the adverse event incidences in the population studied.

          Other events reported by 1% or more of patients treated in controlled trials but equally or more frequent in the placebo group than in the Diazepam rectal gel group were abdominal pain, pain, nervousness, and rhinitis. Other events reported by fewer than 1% of patients were infection, anorexia, vomiting, anemia, lymphadenopathy, grand mal convulsion, hyperkinesia, cough increased, pruritus, sweating, mydriasis, and urinary tract infection.
 

 The pattern of adverse events was similar for different age, race and gender groups.



   Other Adverse Events Observed During All Clinical Trials:

  Diazepam rectal gel has been administered to 573 patients with epilepsy during all clinical trials, only some of which were placebo-controlled. During these trials, all adverse events were recorded by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals having adverse events, similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using modified COSTART dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the listing below. All of the events listed below occurred in at least 1% of the 573 individuals exposed to Diazepam rectal gel.



 All reported events are included except those already listed above, events unlikely to be drug-related, and those too general to be informative. Events are included without regard to determination of a causal relationship to diazepam.



   BODY AS A WHOLE:  Asthenia



   CARDIOVASCULAR:  Hypotension, vasodilatation



   NERVOUS:  Agitation, confusion, convulsion, dysarthria, emotional lability, speech disorder, thinking abnormal, vertigo



   RESPIRATORY:  Hiccup



 The following infrequent adverse events were not seen with Diazepam rectal gel but have been reported previously with diazepam use: depression, slurred speech, syncope, constipation, changes in libido, urinary retention, bradycardia, cardiovascular collapse, nystagmus, urticaria, neutropenia and jaundice.



 Paradoxical reactions such as acute hyperexcited states, anxiety, hallucinations, increased muscle spasticity, insomnia, rage, sleep disturbances and stimulation have been reported with diazepam; should these occur, use of Diazepam rectal gel should be discontinued.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS 

  WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS 

    *   Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS sections). 
   *  Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. 
 *  Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. 
 *  Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.

    <Section id="S3" name="precautions">    PRECAUTIONS



   Information to Be Communicated by the Prescriber to Patients and Caregivers



   Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids:  



 Inform patients and caregivers that potentially fatal additive effects may occur if Diastat or Diastat AcuDial is used with opioids and not to use such drugs concomitantly unless supervised by a health care provider (see  WARNINGS  and  PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions  ).



  Administration: Prescribers are strongly advised to take all reasonable steps to ensure that caregivers  fully understand their role and obligations vis a vis the administration of Diazepam rectal gel toindividuals in their care. Prescribers should routinely discuss the steps in the Patient/Caregiver PackageInsert (see Patient/Caregiver Insert printed at the end of the product labeling and also included in the product carton). The successful and safe use of Diazepam rectal gel depends in large measure on thecompetence and performance of the caregiver.
 

  Prescribers should advise caregivers that they expect to be informed immediately if a patient develops any  new findings which are not typical of the patient's characteristic seizure episode.
 

    Caution in Renally Impaired Patients



  Metabolites of Diazepam rectal gel are excreted by the kidneys; to avoid their excess accumulation, caution should be exercised in the administration of the drug to patients with impaired renal function.



    Caution in Hepatically Impaired Patients



  Concomitant liver disease is known to decrease the clearance of diazepam (see   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Special Populations, Hepatic Impairment    ). Therefore, Diazepam rectal gel should be used with caution in patients with liver disease.



    Use in Pediatrics



  The controlled trials demonstrating the effectiveness of Diazepam rectal gel included children two years of age and older. Clinical studies have not been conducted to establish the efficacy and safety of Diazepam rectal gel in children under two years of age.



    Use in Patients with Compromised Respiratory Function



  Diazepam rectal gel should be used with caution in patients with compromised respiratory function related to a concurrent disease process (e.g., asthma, pneumonia) or neurologic damage.



    Use in Elderly



  In elderly patients Diazepam rectal gel should be used with caution due to an increase in halflife with a corresponding decrease in the clearance of free diazepam. It is also recommended that the dosage be decreased to reduce the likelihood of ataxia or oversedation.



  Interference With Cognitive and Motor Performance:  Because benzodiazepines have the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that Diazepam rectal gel therapy does not affect them adversely.



  Pregnancy:  Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with Diazepam rectal gel (see   WARNINGS    section).



  Nursing:  Because diazepam and its metabolites may be present in human breast milk for prolonged periods of time after acute use of Diazepam rectal gel, patients should be advised not to breast-feed for an appropriate period of time after receiving treatment with Diazepam rectal gel.



    Concomitant Medication



  Although Diazepam rectal gel is indicated for use solely on an intermittent basis, the potential or a synergistic CNS-depressant effect when used simultaneously with alcohol or other CNS-depressants must be considered by the prescribing physician, and appropriate recommendations made to the patient and/or caregiver.



    Drug Interactions



  There have been no clinical studies or reports in literature to evaluate the interaction of rectally



 administered diazepam with other drugs. As with all drugs, the potential for interaction by a variety of



 mechanisms is a possibility.



  Effect of Concomitant Use of Benzodiazepines and Opioids:  The concomitant use of benzodiazepines and



 opioids increases the risk of respiratory depression because of actions at different receptor sites in the



 CNS that control respiration. Benzodiazepines interact at GABAA sites, and opioids interact primarily at



 mu receptors. When benzodiazepines and opioids are combined, the potential for benzodiazepines to



 significantly worsen opioid-related respiratory depression exists. Limit dosage and duration of



 concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids, and follow patients closely for respiratory depression



 and sedation.



  Other Psychotropic Agents or Other CNS Depressants:  If Diazepam rectal gel is to be combined with other psychotropic agents or other CNS depressants, careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of the agents to be employed particularly with known compounds which may potentiate the action of diazepam, such as phenothiazines, narcotics, barbiturates, MAO inhibitors and other antidepressants.



  Cimetidine:  The clearance of diazepam and certain other benzodiazepines can be delayed in association



 with cimetidine administration. The clinical significance of this is unclear.



  Valproate:  Valproate may potentiate the CNS-depressant effects of diazepam.



  Effect of Other Drugs on Diazepam Metabolism:   In vitro  studies using human liver preparations suggest that CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 are the principal isozymes involved in the initial oxidative metabolism of diazepam. Therefore, potential interactions may occur when diazepam is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 activity. Potential inhibitors of CYP2C19 (e.g., cimetidine, quinidine, and tranylcypromine) and CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, troleandomycin, and clotrimazole) could decrease the rate of diazepam elimination, while inducers of CYP2C19 (e.g., rifampin) and CYP3A4 (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, dexamethasone and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of diazepam.



  Effect of Diazepam on the Metabolism of Other Drugs:  There are no reports as to which isozymes could be inhibited or induced by diazepam. But, based on the fact that diazepam is a substrate for CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, it is possible that diazepam may interfere with the metabolism of drugs which are substrates for CYP2C19, (e.g. omeprazole, propranolol, and imipramine) and CYP3A4 (e.g. cyclosporine, paclitaxel, terfenadine, theophylline, and warfarin) leading to a potential drug-drug interaction.



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility



  The carcinogenic potential of rectal diazepam has not been evaluated. In studies in which mice and rats were administered diazepam in the diet at a dose of 75 mg/kg/day (approximately six and 12 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD=1 mg/kg/day] on a mg/m  2  basis) for 80 and 104 weeks, respectively, an increased incidence of liver tumors was observed in males of both species.



 The data currently available are inadequate to determine the mutagenic potential of diazepam.



 Reproduction studies in rats showed decreases in the number of pregnancies and in the number of surviving offspring following administration of an oral dose of 100 mg/kg/day (approximately 16 times the MRHD on a mg/m  2  basis) prior to and during mating and throughout gestation and lactation. No adverse effects on fertility or offspring viability were noted at a dose of 80 mg/kg/day (approximately 13 times the MRHD on a mg/m  2  basis).



    Pregnancy



   Category D (see  WARNINGS  section)  



    Labor and Delivery



  In humans, measurable amounts of diazepam have been found in maternal and cord blood, indicating placental transfer of the drug. Until additional information is available, Diazepam rectal gel is not recommended for obstetrical use.



    Nursing Mothers



  Because diazepam and its metabolites may be present in human breast milk for prolonged periods of time after acute use of Diazepam rectal gel, patients should be advised not to breast-feed for an appropriate period of time after receiving treatment with Diazepam rectal gel.

    <Section id="S4" name="warnings">    WARNINGS



   General



   Diazepam rectal gel should only be administered by caregivers who in the opinion of the prescribing physician 1) are able to distinguish the distinct cluster of seizures (and/or the events presumed to herald their onset) from the patient's ordinary seizure activity, 2) have been instructed and judged to be competent to administer the treatment rectally, 3) understand explicitly which seizure manifestations may or may not be treated with diazepam rectal gel, and 4) are able to monitor the clinical response and recognize when that response is such that immediate professional medical evaluation is required.  



    Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids



  Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including Diastat and Diastat AcuDial, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of benzodiazepines and opioids for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.



 Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. If a decision is made to prescribe Diastat or Diastat AcuDial concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use, and follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when Diastat or Diastat AcuDial is used with opioids (see  PRECAUTIONS   section  ).



    CNS Depression



  Because diazepam rectal gel produces CNS depression, patients receiving this drug who are otherwise capable and qualified to do so should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring mental alertness, such as operating machinery, driving a motor vehicle, or riding a bicycle until they have completely returned to their level of baseline functioning.



 Although diazepam rectal gel is indicated for use solely on an intermittent basis, the potential for a synergistic CNS-depressant effect when used simultaneously with alcohol or other CNS depressants must be considered by the prescribing physician, and appropriate recommendations made to the patient and/or caregiver.



 Prolonged CNS depression has been observed in neonates treated with diazepam. Therefore, diazepam rectal gel is not recommended for use in children under six months of age.



    Pregnancy Risks



  No clinical studies have been conducted with diazepam rectal gel in pregnant women. Data from several sources raise concerns about the use of diazepam during pregnancy.



  Animal Findings:  Diazepam has been shown to be teratogenic in mice and hamsters when given orally at single doses of 100 mg/kg or greater (approximately eight times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD=1 mg/kg/day] or greater on a mg/m  2  basis). Cleft palate and exencephaly are the most common and consistently reported malformations produced in these species by administration of high, maternally-toxic doses of diazepam during organogenesis. Rodent studies have indicated that prenatal exposure to diazepam doses similar to those used clinically can produce longterm changes in cellular immune responses, brain neurochemistry, and behavior.



  General Concerns and Considerations About Anticonvulsants:  Reports suggest an association between the use of anticonvulsant drugs by women with epilepsy and an elevated incidence of birth defects in children born to these women. Data are more extensive with respect to phenytoin and phenobarbital, but a smaller number of systematic or anecdotal reports suggest a possible similar association with the use of all known anticonvulsant drugs.



 The reports suggesting an elevated incidence of birth defects in children of drug treated epileptic women cannot be regarded as adequate to prove a definite cause and effect relationship. There are intrinsic methodologic problems in obtaining adequate data on drug teratogenicity in humans; the possibility also exists that other factors, e.g., genetic factors or the epileptic condition itself, may be more important than drug therapy in leading to birth defects. The great majority of mothers on anticonvulsant medication deliver normal infants. It is important to note that anticonvulsant drugs should not be discontinued in patients in whom the drug is administered to prevent seizures because of the strong possibility of precipitating status epilepticus  with attendant hypoxia and threat to life. In individual cases where the severity and frequency of the seizure disorder are such that the removal of medication does not pose a serious threat to the patient, discontinuation of the drug may be considered prior to and during pregnancy, although it cannot be said with any confidence that even mild seizures do not pose some hazards to the developing embryo or fetus.



  General Concerns About Benzodiazepines:  An increased risk of congenital malformations associated with the use of benzodiazepine drugs has been suggested in several studies.



 There may also be non-teratogenic risks associated with the use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy. There have been reports of neonatal flaccidity, respiratory and feeding difficulties, and hypothermia in children born to mothers who have been receiving benzodiazepines late in pregnancy. In addition, children born to mothers receiving benzodiazepines on a regular basis late in pregnancy may be at some risk of experiencing withdrawal symptoms during the postnatal period.



  Advice Regarding the Use of Diazepam rectal gel in Women of Childbearing Potential:  In general, the use of Diazepam rectal gel in women of childbearing potential, and more specifically during known pregnancy, should be considered only when the clinical situation warrants the risk to the fetus.



 The specific considerations addressed above regarding the use of anticonvulsants in epileptic women of childbearing potential should be weighed in treating or counseling these women.



 Because of experience with other members of the benzodiazepine class, Diazepam rectal gel is assumed to be capable of causing an increased risk of congenital abnormalities when administered to a pregnant woman during the first trimester. The possibility that a woman of childbearing potential may be pregnant at the time of institution of therapy should be considered. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Patients should also be advised that if they become pregnant during therapy or intend to become pregnant they should communicate with their physician about the desirability of discontinuing the drug.



    Withdrawal Symptoms



  Withdrawal symptoms of the barbiturate type have occurred after the discontinuation of regular use of benzodiazepines (see   DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE    section).



    Chronic Use



  Diazepam rectal gel is not recommended for chronic, daily use as an anticonvulsant because of the potential for development of tolerance to diazepam. Chronic daily use of diazepam may increase the frequency and/or severity of tonic clonic seizures, requiring an increase in the dosage of standard anticonvulsant medication. In such cases, abrupt withdrawal of chronic diazepam may also be associated with a temporary increase in the frequency and/or severity of seizures.



    Use in Patients with Petit Mal Status



  Tonic status epilepticus  has been precipitated in patients treated with IV diazepam for petit mal status or petit mal variant status.
