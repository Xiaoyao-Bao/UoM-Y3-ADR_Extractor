  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     Acromegaly  



 The data described below reflect exposure to SOMATULINE DEPOT in 416 acromegalic patients in seven studies. One study was a fixed-dose pharmacokinetic study. The other six studies were open-label or extension studies, one had a placebo-controlled, run-in period, and another had an active control. The population was mainly Caucasian (329/353, 93%) with a median age of 53 years of age (range 19 to 84 years). Fifty-four subjects (13%) were age 66 to 74 and 18 subjects (4.3%) were 75 years of age and older.



 Patients were evenly matched for sex (205 males and 211 females). The median average monthly dose was 91.2 mg (e.g., 90 mg injected via the deep subcutaneous route every 4 weeks) over 385 days with a median cumulative dose of 1290 mg. Of the patients reporting acromegaly, severity at baseline (N=265), serum GH levels were less than 10 ng/mL for 69% (183/265) of the patients and 10 ng/mL or greater for 31% (82/265) of the patients.



 The most commonly reported adverse reactions reported by greater than 5% of patients who received SOMATULINE DEPOT (N=416) in the overall pooled safety studies in acromegaly patients were gastrointestinal disorders (diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, constipation, flatulence, vomiting, loose stools), cholelithiasis, and injection site reactions.



 Tables 1 and 2 present adverse reaction data from clinical studies with SOMATULINE DEPOT in acromegalic patients. The tables include data from a single clinical study and pooled data from seven clinical studies.



     Adverse Reactions in Parallel Fixed-Dose Phase of Study 1  



 The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse reactions for SOMATULINE DEPOT 60, 90, and 120 mg by dose as reported during the first 4 months (fixed-dose phase) of Study 1  [see  Clinical Studies (14.1)  ]  are provided in Table 1.

           In addition to the adverse reactions listed in Table 2, the following reactions were also seen:
 

 *  Sinus bradycardia occurred in 7% (12) of patients in the pooled Study 1 and 2 and in 3% (13) of patients in the overall pooled studies. 
 *  Hypertension occurred in 7% (11) of patients in the pooled Study 1 and 2 and in 5% (20) of patients in the overall pooled studies. 
 *  Anemia occurred in 7% (12) of patients in the pooled Study 1 and 2 and in 3% (14) of patients in the overall pooled studies. 
        Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions  
 

 In the pooled clinical studies of SOMATULINE DEPOT therapy, a variety of gastrointestinal (GI) reactions occurred, the majority of which were mild to moderate in severity. One percent of acromegalic patients treated with SOMATULINE DEPOT in the pooled clinical studies discontinued treatment because of gastrointestinal reactions.



 Pancreatitis was reported in less than 1% of patients.



     Gallbladder Adverse Reactions  



 In clinical studies involving 416 acromegalic patients treated with SOMATULINE DEPOT, cholelithiasis and gallbladder sludge were reported in 20% of the patients. Among 167 acromegalic patients treated with SOMATULINE DEPOT who underwent routine evaluation with gallbladder ultrasound, 17% had gallstones at baseline. New cholelithiasis was reported in 12% of patients. Cholelithiasis may be related to dose or duration of exposure  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  .



     Injection Site Reactions  



 In the pooled clinical studies, injection site pain (4%) and injection site mass (2%) were the most frequently reported local adverse drug reactions that occurred with the administration of SOMATULINE DEPOT. In a specific analysis, 20 of 413 patients (5%) presented indurations at the injection site. Injection site adverse reactions were more commonly reported soon after the start of treatment and were less commonly reported as treatment continued. Such adverse reactions were usually mild or moderate but did lead to withdrawal from clinical studies in two subjects.



     Glucose Metabolism Adverse Reactions  



 In the clinical studies in acromegalic patients treated with SOMATULINE DEPOT, adverse reactions of dysglycemia (hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, diabetes) were reported by 14% (47/332) of patients and were considered related to study drug in 7% (24/332) of patients  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]  .



     Cardiac Adverse Reactions  



 In the pooled clinical studies, sinus bradycardia (3%) was the most frequently observed heart rate and rhythm disorder. All other cardiac adverse drug reactions were observed in less than 1% of patients. The relationship of these events to SOMATULINE DEPOT could not be established because many of these patients had underlying cardiac disease  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  .



 A comparative echocardiography study of lanreotide and another somatostatin analog demonstrated no difference in the development of new or worsening valvular regurgitation between the 2 treatments over 1 year. The occurrence of clinically significant mitral regurgitation (i.e., moderate or severe in intensity) or of clinically significant aortic regurgitation (i.e., at least mild in intensity) was low in both groups of patients throughout the study.



     Other Adverse Reactions  



 For the most commonly occurring adverse reactions in the pooled analysis, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and cholelithiasis, there was no apparent trend for increasing incidence with age. GI disorders and renal and urinary disorders were more common in patients with documented hepatic impairment; however, the incidence of cholelithiasis was similar between groups.



     Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors  



 The safety of SOMATULINE DEPOT 120 mg for the treatment of patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) was evaluated in Study 3, a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients in Study 3 were randomized to receive SOMATULINE DEPOT (N=101) or placebo (N=103) administered by deep subcutaneous injection once every 4 weeks. The data below reflect exposure to SOMATULINE DEPOT in 101 patients with GEP-NETs, including 87 patients exposed for at least 6 months and 72 patients exposed for at least 1 year (median duration of exposure 22 months). Patients treated with SOMATULINE DEPOT had a median age of 64 years (range 30 to 83 years), 53% were men and 96% were Caucasian. Eighty-one percent of patients (83/101) in the SOMATULINE DEPOT arm and 82% of patients (82/103) in the placebo arm did not have disease progression within 6 months of enrollment and had not received prior therapy for GEP-NETs. The rates of discontinuation due to treatment-emergent adverse reactions were 5% (5/101 patients) in the SOMATULINE DEPOT arm and 3% (3/103 patients) in the placebo arm.



 Table 3 compares the adverse reactions reported with an incidence of 5% and greater in patients receiving SOMATULINE DEPOT 120 mg administered every 4 weeks and reported more commonly than placebo.

               Carcinoid Syndrome  
 

 The safety of SOMATULINE DEPOT 120 mg in patients with histopathologically confirmed neuroendocrine tumors and a history of carcinoid syndrome (flushing and/or diarrhea) was evaluated in Study 4, a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients were randomized to receive SOMATULINE DEPOT (N=59) or placebo (N=56) administered by deep subcutaneous injection once every 4 weeks. Patients in both arms of Study 4 had access to subcutaneous octreotide as rescue medication for symptom control.



 Adverse reactions reported in Study 4 were generally similar to those reported in Study 3 for the GEP-NETs population shown in Table 3 above. Adverse reactions occurring in Study 4 in 5% and greater of SOMATULINE DEPOT-treated patients and occurring at least 5% more than in placebo-treated patients were headache (12% vs 5%, respectively), dizziness (7% vs 0%, respectively), and muscle spasm (5% vs 0%, respectively) by week 16.



   6.2 Immunogenicity

  As with all peptides, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to lanreotide in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading.



 Laboratory investigations of acromegalic patients treated with SOMATULINE DEPOT in clinical studies show that the percentage of patients with putative antibodies at any time point after treatment is low (less than 1% to 4% of patients in specific studies whose antibodies were tested). The antibodies did not appear to affect the efficacy or safety of SOMATULINE DEPOT.



 In Study 3, development of anti-lanreotide antibodies was assessed using a radioimmunoprecipitation assay. In patients with GEP NETs receiving SOMATULINE DEPOT, the incidence of anti-lanreotide antibodies was 4% (3 of 82) at 24 weeks, 10% (7 of 67) at 48 weeks, 11% (6 of 57) at 72 weeks, and 10% (8 of 84) at 96 weeks. Assessment for neutralizing antibodies was not conducted. In Study 4, less than 2% (2 of 108) of the patients treated with SOMATULINE DEPOT developed anti-lanreotide antibodies.



   6.3 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of SOMATULINE DEPOT. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Hepatobiliary:  Steatorrhea, cholecystitis, pancreatitis  Body as a Whole:  angioedema and anaphylaxis

   EXCERPT:    *   Cholelithiasis and Gallbladder Sludge : Gallstones may occur; consider periodic monitoring. (  5.1  ) 
 *   Hyperglycemia and Hypoglycemia : Glucose monitoring is recommended and antidiabetic treatment adjusted accordingly. (  5.2  ,  7.1  ) 
 *   Cardiovascular Abnormalities : Decrease in heart rate may occur. Use with caution in at-risk patients. (  5.3  ) 
 *   Thyroid Function Abnormalities : Decreases in thyroid function may occur; perform tests where clinically indicated. (  5.4  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Cholelithiasis and Gallbladder Sludge



  SOMATULINE DEPOT may reduce gallbladder motility and lead to gallstone formation; therefore, patients may need to be monitored periodically [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ,  Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)  ]  .



    5.2 Hyperglycemia and Hypoglycemia



  Pharmacological studies in animals and humans show that lanreotide, like somatostatin and other somatostatin analogs, inhibits the secretion of insulin and glucagon. Hence, patients treated with SOMATULINE DEPOT may experience hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. Blood glucose levels should be monitored when lanreotide treatment is initiated, or when the dose is altered, and antidiabetic treatment should be adjusted accordingly [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



    5.3 Cardiovascular Abnormalities



  The most common overall cardiac adverse reactions observed in three pooled SOMATULINE DEPOT cardiac studies in patients with acromegaly were sinus bradycardia (12/217, 5.5%), bradycardia (6/217, 2.8%), and hypertension (12/217, 5.5%) [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  



 In 81 patients with baseline heart rates of 60 beats per minute (bpm) or greater treated with SOMATULINE DEPOT in Study 3, the incidence of heart rate less than 60 bpm was 23% (19/81) as compared to 16% (15/94) of placebo treated patients; 10 patients (12%) had documented heart rates less than 60 bpm on more than one visit. The incidence of documented episodes of heart rate less than 50 bpm as well as the incidence of bradycardia reported as an adverse event was 1% in each treatment group. Initiate appropriate medical management in patients who develop symptomatic bradycardia.



 In patients without underlying cardiac disease, SOMATULINE DEPOT may lead to a decrease in heart rate without necessarily reaching the threshold of bradycardia. In patients suffering from cardiac disorders prior to SOMATULINE DEPOT treatment, sinus bradycardia may occur. Care should be taken when initiating treatment with SOMATULINE DEPOT in patients with bradycardia.



    5.4 Thyroid Function Abnormalities



  Slight decreases in thyroid function have been seen during treatment with lanreotide in acromegalic patients, though clinical hypothyroidism is rare (less than 1%). Thyroid function tests are recommended where clinically indicated.



    5.5 Monitoring: Laboratory Tests



   Acromegaly  : Serum GH and IGF-1 levels are useful markers of the disease and the effectiveness of treatment [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  .
