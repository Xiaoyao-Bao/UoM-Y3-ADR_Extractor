  (SEE  PRECAUTIONS  )



 The safety of FORTOVASE was studied in more than 500 patients who received the drug either alone or in combination with other antiretroviral agents. The majority of treatment-related adverse events were of mild intensity. The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events among patients receiving FORTOVASE in combination with other antiretroviral agents were diarrhea, nausea, abdominal discomfort, and dyspepsia.



 Clinical adverse events of at least moderate intensity, which occurred in &gt;=2% of patients in studies NV15182 (an open-label, single-arm safety study) and NV15355 (an open-label randomized study comparing FORTOVASE and INVIRASE) are summarized in Table 7. The median duration of treatment in studies NV15182 and NV15355 were 52 and 18 weeks, respectively. In NV15182, more than 300 patients were on treatment for approximately 1 year.



 FORTOVASE did not appear to alter the pattern, frequency or severity of known major toxicities associated with the use of nucleoside analogues. Physicians should refer to the complete product information for other antiretroviral agents as appropriate for drug-associated adverse reactions to these other agents.



 Rare occurrences of the following serious adverse experiences have been reported during clinical trials of FORTOVASE and/or INVIRASE and were considered at least possibly related to use of study drugs: confusion, ataxia and weakness; seizures; headache; acute myeloblastic leukemia; hemolytic anemia; thrombocytopenia; thrombocytopenia and intracranial hemorrhage leading to death; attempted suicide; Stevens-Johnson syndrome; bullous skin eruption and polyarthritis; severe cutaneous reaction associated with increased liver function tests; isolated elevation of transaminases; exacerbation of chronic liver disease with Grade 4 elevated liver function tests, jaundice, ascites, and right and left upper quadrant abdominal pain; pancreatitis leading to death; intestinal obstruction; portal hypertension; thrombophlebitis; peripheral vasoconstriction; drug fever; nephrolithiasis; and acute renal insufficiency.

   Laboratory Abnormalities

  In the MaxCmin 1 study, Grade 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia (2.0% of patients) and anemia (2.0%) were observed with FORTOVASE in combination with ritonavir. At 48 weeks, other lab abnormalities included increased ALT, increased AST, increased GGT, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, increased TSH, neutropenia, raised amylase, and increased LDH.



 Table 9 summarizes the percentage of patients with marked laboratory abnormalities in study NV15182 and NV15355 (median duration of treatment was 52 and 18 weeks, respectively). In study NV15182, by 48 weeks &lt;1% of patients discontinued treatment due to laboratory abnormalities.



 In the safety study (NV15182), 27% to 33% of subjects experienced &gt;=1 grade shifts in ALT and AST during the 48-week study period. In 46% of such events, there was a single abnormal transaminase level with no evidence of persistently elevated enzyme values during the course of study. Only 3% to 4% of patients had &gt;=3 grade shifts in transaminase levels and less than 0.5% of patients had to discontinue the study for increased liver function test values.

    General



  FORTOVASE (saquinavir) soft gelatin capsules and INVIRASE (saquinavir mesylate) capsules are not bioequivalent and cannot be used interchangeably when used as the sole protease inhibitor. Only FORTOVASE should be used for the initiation of therapy that includes saquinavir as a sole protease inhibitor (see  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  ) since FORTOVASE soft gelatin capsules provide greater bioavailability and efficacy than INVIRASE capsules.



 If a serious or severe toxicity occurs during treatment with FORTOVASE, FORTOVASE should be interrupted until the etiology of the event is identified or the toxicity resolves. At that time, resumption of treatment with full-dose FORTOVASE may be considered. For antiretroviral agents used in combination with FORTOVASE, physicians should refer to the complete product information for these drugs for dose adjustment recommendations and for information regarding drug-associated adverse reactions.



    Hepatic Effects



  The use of FORTOVASE by patients with hepatic impairment has not been studied. In the absence of such studies, caution should be exercised, as increases in saquinavir levels and/or increases in liver enzymes may occur. In patients with underlying hepatitis B or C, cirrhosis, chronic alcoholism and/or other underlying liver abnormalities there have been reports of worsening liver disease.



    Renal Effects



  Renal clearance is only a minor elimination pathway; the principal route of metabolism and excretion for saquinavir is by the liver. Therefore, no dose adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment. However, patients with severe renal impairment have not been studied and caution should be exercised when prescribing saquinavir in this population.



    Hemophilia



  There have been reports of spontaneous bleeding in patients with hemophilia A and B treated with protease inhibitors. In some patients additional factor VIII was required. In the majority of reported cases treatment with protease inhibitors was continued or restarted. A causal relationship between protease-inhibitor therapy and these episodes has not been established.



    Hyperlipidemia



  Elevated cholesterol and/or triglyceride levels have been observed in some patients taking saquinavir in combination with ritonavir. Marked elevation in triglyceride levels is a risk factor for development of pancreatitis. Cholesterol and triglyceride levels should be monitored prior to initiating combination dosing regimen of FORTOVASE or INVIRASE with ritonavir, and at periodic intervals while on such therapy. In these patients, lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate.



    Fat Redistribution



  Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), facial wasting, peripheral wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. A causal relationship between protease inhibitor therapy and these events has not been established and the long-term consequences are currently unknown.



    Resistance/Cross-resistance



  Varying degrees of cross-resistance among protease inhibitors have been observed. Continued administration of FORTOVASE therapy following loss of viral suppression may increase the likelihood of cross-resistance to other protease inhibitors (see  MICROBIOLOGY  ).



    Information For Patients



  A statement to patients and health care providers is included on the product's bottle label: ALERT: Find out about medicines that should NOT be taken with FORTOVASE  . A Patient Package Insert (PPI) for FORTOVASE is available for patient information.



 Patients should be informed that any change from INVIRASE to FORTOVASE or FORTOVASE to INVIRASE coadministered with ritonavir should be made only under the supervision of a physician.



 FORTOVASE may interact with some drugs; therefore, patients should be advised to report to their doctor the use of any other prescription, nonprescription medication, or herbal products, particularly St. John's wort.



 Patients should be informed that FORTOVASE is not a cure for HIV infection and that they may continue to acquire illnesses associated with advanced HIV infection, including opportunistic infections. Patients should be advised that FORTOVASE should be used only in combination with other active antiretroviral medications.



 Patients should be informed that redistribution or accumulation of body fat may occur in patients receiving protease inhibitors and that the cause and long-term health effects of these conditions are not known at this time.



 Patients should be told that the long-term effects of FORTOVASE are unknown at this time. They should be informed that FORTOVASE therapy has not been shown to reduce the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or blood contamination.



 Patients should be advised that FORTOVASE should be taken within 2 hours after a full meal. When FORTOVASE is coadministered with ritonavir a light meal is sufficient (see  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics  ). Patients should be advised of the importance of taking their medication every day, as prescribed, to achieve maximum benefit. Patients should not alter the dose or discontinue therapy without consulting their physician. If a dose is missed, patients should take the next dose as soon as possible. However, the patient should not double the next dose.



 Patients should be informed that refrigerated (36 degrees  to 46 degrees F, 2 degrees  to 8 degrees C) capsules of FORTOVASE remain stable until the expiration date printed on the label. Once brought to room temperature [at or below 77 degrees F (25 degrees C)], capsules should be used within 3 months.



    Laboratory Tests



  Clinical chemistry tests, viral load, and CD4 count should be performed prior to initiating FORTOVASE therapy and at appropriate intervals thereafter. Elevated nonfasting triglyceride levels have been observed in patients in saquinavir trials. Triglyceride levels should be periodically monitored during therapy. For comprehensive information concerning laboratory test alterations associated with use of other antiretroviral therapies, physicians should refer to the complete product information for these drugs.



    Drug Interactions



   Several drug interaction studies have been completed with both INVIRASE and FORTOVASE. Observations from drug interaction studies with FORTOVASE may not be predictive for INVIRASE.  If ritonavir is coadministered, prescribers should also refer to the prescribing information for ritonavir regarding drug interactions associated with this agent.



 The metabolism of saquinavir is mediated by cytochrome P450, with the specific isoenzyme CYP3A4 responsible for 90% of the hepatic metabolism. Additionally, saquinavir is a substrate for P-Glycoprotein (Pgp). Therefore, drugs that affect CYP3A4 and/or Pgp, may modify the pharmacokinetics of saquinavir. Similarly, saquinavir might also modify the pharmacokinetics of other drugs that are substrates for CYP3A4 or Pgp.



 Drugs that are contraindicated specifically due to the expected magnitude of interaction and potential for serious adverse events are listed in Table 4 under CONTRAINDICATIONS. Additional drugs that are not recommended for coadministration with FORTOVASE are included in Table 5. These recommendations are based on either drug interaction studies or predicted interactions due to the expected magnitude of interaction and potential for serious events or loss of efficacy.



 Drug interactions that have been established based on drug interaction studies are listed with the pharmacokinetic results in Table 2, which summarizes the effect of saquinavir, administered as FORTOVASE, on the geometric mean AUC and Cmaxof coadministered drugs and Table 3, which summarizes the effect of coadministered drugs on the geometric mean AUC and Cmaxof saquinavir. Clinical dose recommendations can be found in Table 6. The magnitude of interactions may be different when FORTOVASE is given with ritonavir.

            Drugs That Are Mainly Metabolized by CYP3A4
 

  Although specific studies have not been performed, coadministration with drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, calcium channel blockers, dapsone, disopyramide, quinine, amiodarone, quinidine, warfarin, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, ergot derivatives, pimozide, carbamazepine, fentanyl, alfentanyl, alprazolam, nefazodone and triazolam) may have elevated plasma concentrations when coadministered with saquinavir; therefore, these combinations should be used with caution. If FORTOVASE is coadministered with ritonavir, the ritonavir label should be reviewed for additional drugs that should not be coadministered.



    Inducers of CYP3A4



  Coadministration with compounds that are potent inducers of CYP3A4 (eg, phenobarbital, phenytoin, dexamethasone, carbamazepine) may result in decreased plasma levels of saquinavir.



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment Of Fertility



  



    Carcinogenesis



  Carcinogenicity studies found no indication of carcinogenic activity in rats and mice administered saquinavir for approximately 2 years. The plasma exposures (AUC values) in the respective species were up to approximately 60% of (using rat) and equivalent to (using mouse) those obtained in humans at the recommended clinical dose (FORTOVASE 1200 mg tid).



    Mutagenesis



  Mutagenicity and genotoxicity studies, with and without metabolic activation where appropriate, have shown that saquinavir has no mutagenic activity in vitro in either bacterial (Ames test) or mammalian cells (Chinese hamster lung V79/HPRT test). Saquinavir does not induce chromosomal damage in vivo in the mouse micronucleus assay or in vitro in human peripheral blood lymphocytes and does not induce primary DNA damage in vitro in the unscheduled DNA synthesis test.



    Impairment of Fertility



  Fertility and reproductive performance were not affected in rats at plasma exposures (AUC values) approximately 50% of those achieved in humans at the recommended dose.



    Pregnancy



  



    Teratogenic Effects



  Category B. Reproduction studies conducted with saquinavir in rats have shown no embryotoxicity or teratogenicity at plasma exposures (AUC values) approximately 50% of those achieved in humans at the recommended dose or in rabbits at plasma exposures approximately 40% of those achieved at the recommended clinical dose of FORTOVASE. Distribution studies in these species showed that placental transfer of saquinavir is low (less than 5% of maternal plasma concentrations).



 Studies in rats indicated that exposure to saquinavir from late pregnancy through lactation at plasma concentrations (AUC values) approximately 50% of those achieved in humans at the recommended dose of FORTOVASE had no effect on the survival, growth and development of offspring to weaning. Clinical experience in pregnant women is limited. Saquinavir should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.



    Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry



  To monitor maternal-fetal outcomes of pregnant women exposed to antiretroviral medications, including FORTOVASE, an Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry has been established. Physicians are encouraged to register patients by calling 1-800-258-4263.



    Nursing Mothers



   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV-infected mothers not breast-feed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV  . It is not known whether saquinavir is excreted in human milk. Because of both the potential for HIV transmission and the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, mothers should be instructed not to breast-feed if they are receiving antiretroviral medications, including FORTOVASE  .



    Pediatric Use



  FORTOVASE should not be administered as a sole protease inhibitor to pediatric patients &lt;=16 years of age due to the risk of reduced saquinavir plasma concentrations compared to adults.



 Safety and effectiveness of saquinavir when coadministered with ritonavir to pediatric patients is under investigation.



    Geriatric Use



  Clinical studies of FORTOVASE did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, caution should be taken when dosing FORTOVASE in elderly patients due to the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.
</Section>
    <Section id="S3" name="warnings">    WARNINGS



   ALERT: Find out about medicines that should not be taken with FORTOVASE  . This statement is included on the product's bottle label.



    Interaction with HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors



  Concomitant use of FORTOVASE with lovastatin or simvastatin is not recommended. Caution should be exercised if HIV protease inhibitors, including FORTOVASE, are used concurrently with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are also metabolized by the CYP3A4 pathway (eg, atorvastatin). Since increased concentrations of statins can, in rare cases, cause severe adverse events such as myopathy including rhabdomyolysis, this risk may be increased when HIV protease inhibitors, including saquinavir, are used in combination with these drugs.



    Interaction with St. John's Wort (hypericum perforatum)



  Concomitant use of FORTOVASE and St. Johns wort (hypericum perforatum) or products containing St. John's wort is not recommended. Coadministration of protease inhibitors, including FORTOVASE, with St. John's wort is expected to substantially decrease protease inhibitor concentrations and may result in sub-optimal levels of FORTOVASE and lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to FORTOVASE or to the class of protease inhibitors.



    Interaction with Garlic Capsules



  Garlic capsules should not be used while taking saquinavir as the sole protease inhibitor due to the risk of decreased saquinavir plasma concentrations. No data are available for the coadministration of FORTOVASE/ritonavir or INVIRASE/ritonavir and garlic capsules.



    Diabetes Mellitus and Hyperglycemia



  New onset diabetes mellitus, exacerbation of pre-existing diabetes mellitus and hyperglycemia have been reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV-infected patients receiving protease-inhibitor therapy. Some patients required either initiation or dose adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents for the treatment of these events. In some cases diabetic ketoacidosis has occurred. In those patients who discontinued protease-inhibitor therapy, hyperglycemia persisted in some cases. Because these events have been reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made and a causal relationship between protease-inhibitor therapy and these events has not been established.
