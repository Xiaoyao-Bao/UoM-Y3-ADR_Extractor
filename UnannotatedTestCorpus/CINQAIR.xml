  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 Overall, 2195 subjects received at least 1 dose of CINQAIR. The data described below reflect exposure to CINQAIR in 1611 patients with asthma, including 1120 exposed for up to 16 weeks, 1006 exposed for 6 months, 759 exposed for 1 year, and 249 exposed for longer than 2 years. The above referenced safety exposure for CINQAIR is derived from placebo-controlled studies ranging from 15 to 52 weeks in duration (CINQAIR 0.3 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg [n=1131] and placebo [n=730]) and 480 new CINQAIR 3 mg/kg exposures (previously on placebo) from a single open-label extension study (n=1051). While a lower dose of CINQAIR 0.3 mg/kg (n=103) was included in a clinical trial, 3 mg/kg is the only recommended dose  [see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  )]  . Of the 1611 patients, 1596 received the 3 mg/kg dose, 1028 of which were in the placebo-controlled studies. In the placebo-controlled asthma studies, the population studied was 12 to 76 years of age, 62% female, and 73% white. While subjects aged 12 to 17 years were included in these trials, CINQAIR is not approved for use in this age group  [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.4  )]  .



 Serious adverse reactions that occurred in placebo-controlled studies in more than 1 subject and in a greater percentage of subjects treated with CINQAIR (n=1131) than placebo (n=730) included anaphylaxis (3 subjects vs. 0 subjects, respectively). The 3 subjects who experienced anaphylaxis were discontinued from the clinical studies  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )]  . Malignancy also occurred more commonly in patients treated with CINQAIR than placebo (0.6% and 0.3%, respectively)  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  )]  .



 Adverse reactions that occurred at greater than or equal to 2% incidence and more commonly than in the placebo group included 1 event: oropharyngeal pain (2.6% vs. 2.2%).



   CPK elevations and muscle-related adverse reactions  



 Elevated baseline creatine phosphokinase (CPK) was more frequent in patients randomized to CINQAIR (14%) versus placebo (9%). Transient CPK elevations in patients with normal baseline CPK values were observed more frequently with CINQAIR (20%) versus placebo (18%) during routine laboratory assessments. CPK elevations &gt;10 x ULN, regardless of baseline CPK value, were 0.8% in the CINQAIR group compared to 0.4% in the placebo group. CPK elevations &gt;10 x ULN were asymptomatic and did not lead to treatment discontinuation.



 Myalgia was reported in 1% (10/1028) of patients in the CINQAIR 3 mg/kg group compared to 0.5% (4/730) of patients in the placebo group. On the day of infusion, musculoskeletal adverse reactions were reported in 2.2% and 1.5% of patients treated with CINQAIR 3 mg/kg and placebo, respectively. These reactions included (but were not limited to) musculoskeletal chest pain, neck pain, muscle spasms, extremity pain, muscle fatigue, and musculoskeletal pain.



   6.2 Immunogenicity

  As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. In placebo-controlled studies, a treatment-emergent anti-reslizumab antibody response developed in 53/983 (5.4%) of CINQAIR-treated patients (3 mg/kg). In the long-term, open-label study, treatment-emergent anti-reslizumab antibodies were detected in 49/1014 (4.8%) of CINQAIR-treated (3 mg/kg) asthma patients over 36 months. The antibody responses were of low titer and often transient. Neutralizing antibodies and product-specific IgE antibodies were not evaluated. There was no detectable impact of the antibodies on the clinical pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, clinical efficacy, and safety of CINQAIR  [see Clinical Pharmacology (  12.2  )]  .



 The data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were positive for antibodies to reslizumab in specific assays. The observed incidence of antibody response is highly dependent on several factors, including assay sensitivity and specificity, assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medication, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to reslizumab with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: ANAPHYLAXIS

  WARNING: ANAPHYLAXIS

    Anaphylaxis has been observed with CINQAIR infusion in 0.3% of patients in placebo-controlled clinical studies. Anaphylaxis was reported as early as the second dose of CINQAIR   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  ), Adverse Reactions (  6  )]  .    



   Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening.  Patients should be observed for an appropriate period of time after CINQAIR administration by a healthcare professional prepared to manage anaphylaxis. Discontinue CINQAIR immediately if the patient experiences signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis   [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  ),     Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )]  .  



   EXCERPT:     WARNING: ANAPHYLAXIS  



     See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.    



 *  Anaphylaxis occurred with CINQAIR infusion in 0.3% of patients in placebo-controlled studies (5.1) 
 *  Patients should be observed for an appropriate period of time after CINQAIR infusion; healthcare professionals should be prepared to manage anaphylaxis that can be life-threatening (5.1) 
 *  Discontinue CINQAIR immediately if the patient experiences anaphylaxis (5.1)

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Malignancy: Malignancies were observed in clinical studies. (  5.3  ) 
 *  Reduction in Corticosteroid Dosage: Do not discontinue systemic or inhaled corticosteroids abruptly upon initiation of therapy with CINQAIR. Decrease corticosteroids gradually, if appropriate. (  5.4  ) 
 *  Parasitic (Helminth) Infection: Treat patients with pre-existing helminth infections before therapy with CINQAIR. If patients become infected while receiving CINQAIR and do not respond to anti-helminth treatment, discontinue CINQAIR until the parasitic infection resolves. (  5.5  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Anaphylaxis



  Anaphylaxis to CINQAIR was reported in 0.3% of asthma patients in placebo-controlled clinical studies [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . These events were observed during or within 20 minutes after completion of the CINQAIR infusion and reported as early as the second dose of CINQAIR. Manifestations included dyspnea, decreased oxygen saturation, wheezing, vomiting, and skin and mucosal involvement, including urticaria. In all 3 cases, CINQAIR was discontinued.



 Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening. CINQAIR should be administered in a healthcare setting by a healthcare professional prepared to manage anaphylaxis. Patients should be observed for an appropriate period of time after CINQAIR administration. If severe systemic reactions, including anaphylaxis, occur, stop administration of CINQAIR immediately and provide appropriate medical treatment. Prior to discharge, inform patients of the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis and instruct them to seek immediate medical care if symptoms occur. Discontinue CINQAIR use permanently if the patient experiences signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis [see Contraindications (  4  )].  



    5.2 Acute Asthma Symptoms or Deteriorating Disease



  CINQAIR should not be used to treat acute asthma symptoms or acute exacerbations. Do not use CINQAIR to treat acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus. Patients should seek medical advice if their asthma remains uncontrolled or worsens after initiation of treatment with CINQAIR.



    5.3 Malignancy



  In placebo-controlled clinical studies, 6/1028 (0.6%) patients receiving 3 mg/kg CINQAIR had at least 1 malignant neoplasm reported compared to 2/730 (0.3%) patients in the placebo group. The observed malignancies in CINQAIR-treated patients were diverse in nature and without clustering of any particular tissue type. The majority of malignancies were diagnosed within less than six months of exposure to CINQAIR.



    5.4 Reduction of Corticosteroid Dosage



  No clinical studies have been conducted to assess reduction of maintenance corticosteroid dosages following administration of CINQAIR. Do not discontinue systemic or inhaled corticosteroids abruptly upon initiation of therapy with CINQAIR. Reductions in corticosteroid dose, if appropriate, should be gradual and performed under the supervision of a physician. Reduction in corticosteroid dose may be associated with systemic withdrawal symptoms and/or unmask conditions previously suppressed by systemic corticosteroid therapy.



    5.5 Parasitic (Helminth) Infection



  Eosinophils may be involved in the immunological response to some helminth infections. Patients with known parasitic infections were excluded from participation in clinical studies. It is unknown if CINQAIR will influence the immune response against parasitic infections. Treat patients with pre-existing helminth infections before initiating CINQAIR. If patients become infected while receiving treatment with CINQAIR and do not respond to anti-helminth treatment, discontinue treatment with CINQAIR until infection resolves.
