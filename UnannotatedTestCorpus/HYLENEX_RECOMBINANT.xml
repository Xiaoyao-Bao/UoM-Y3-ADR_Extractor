  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of hyaluronidase products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 The most frequently reported adverse experiences have been mild local injection site reactions such as erythema and pain. Hyaluronidase has been reported to enhance the adverse events associated with co-administered drug products. Edema has been reported most frequently in association with subcutaneous fluid administration. Allergic reactions (urticaria or angioedema) have been reported in less than 0.1% of patients receiving hyaluronidase. Anaphylactic-like reactions following retrobulbar block or intravenous injections have occurred, rarely.



    EXCERPT:    *    The most frequently reported adverse reactions have been mild local injection site reactions (  6  ) 
 *    Allergic and anaphylactic-like reactions have been reported, rarely (  6  ) 
    To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Baxter Healthcare Corporation at 1-866-888-2472 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.

   EXCERPT:    *    Spread of Localized Infection (  5.1  ) 
 *    Ocular Damage (  5.2  ) 
 *    Enzyme Inactivation with Intravenous Administration (  5.3  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Spread of Localized Infection



  Hyaluronidase should not be injected into or around an infected or acutely inflamed area because of the danger of spreading a localized infection.



 Hyaluronidase should not be used to reduce the swelling of bites or stings.



    5.2 Ocular Damage



  Hyaluronidase should not be applied directly to the cornea. It is not for topical use.



    5.3 Enzyme Inactivation with Intravenous Administration



  HYLENEX recombinant should not be administered intravenously. Its effects relative to dispersion and absorption of other drugs are not produced when it is administered intravenously because the enzyme is rapidly inactivated.
