  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 In controlled and uncontrolled studies, the most common adverse reactions were nausea, constipation, vomiting, headache, and somnolence. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation (&gt;=1% in any of the treatment phases) were nausea, constipation, vomiting, somnolence, headache, fatigue, and dizziness.



 In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study in subjects with moderate-to-severe chronic low back pain, 410 subjects received TROXYCA ER. This study utilized an enriched enrollment with a randomized withdrawal design in which subjects were titrated to effect on open-label TROXYCA ER for up to 42 days. Once their pain was controlled, 280 subjects were randomized to and received active treatment with TROXYCA ER (146 subjects) or were tapered off TROXYCA ER using a double-dummy design and treated with placebo (134 subjects) for 12 weeks.



 Adverse reactions reported in &gt;=2% of subjects receiving TROXYCA ER in either the titration phase or maintenance phase of the placebo-controlled study are presented in Table 2.

          6.2 Postmarketing Experience
   The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of oxycodone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Serotonin syndrome  : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs.



   Adrenal insufficiency  : Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use.

    Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse  



   TROXYCA ER exposes patients and other users to the risks of opioid addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess each patient's risk prior to prescribing TROXYCA ER, and monitor all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors and conditions   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  .  



       Life  -  threatening Respiratory Depression    



   Serious, life  -  threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of TROXYCA ER. Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of TROXYCA ER or following a dose increase. Instruct patients to swallow TROXYCA ER capsules whole or to sprinkle the contents of the capsule on applesauce and swallow immediately without chewing. Crushing, chewing, or dissolving TROXYCA ER can cause rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]  .  



     Accidental Ingestion  



   Accidental ingestion of even one dose of TROXYCA ER, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of oxycodone   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]  .  



     Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome  



   Prolonged use of TROXYCA ER during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life  -  threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  .  



     Cytochrome P450 3A4 Interaction  



   The concomitant use of TROXYCA ER with all cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may result in an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. In addition, discontinuation of a concomitantly used cytochrome P450 3A4 inducer may result in an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations. Monitor patients receiving TROXYCA ER and any CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.4)  ,   Drug Interactions (7)  ,   Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  .  



       Risks From Concomitant Use With Benzodiazepines Or Other CNS Depressants    



     Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.5)  ,   Drug Interactions (7)  ]  .    



 *  Reserve concomitant prescribing of TROXYCA ER and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. 
 *  Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required.

   5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse



  TROXYCA ER contains oxycodone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, TROXYCA ER exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see  Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)  ]  . As extended-release products such as TROXYCA ER deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of oxycodone present [see  Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)  ]  .



 Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed TROXYCA ER and in those who obtain the drug illicitly. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused.



 Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing TROXYCA ER, and monitor all patients receiving TROXYCA ER for the development of these behaviors or conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol addiction or abuse) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as TROXYCA ER, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of TROXYCA ER along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse.



 Abuse or misuse of TROXYCA ER by cutting, breaking, chewing, crushing, or dissolving the pellets in TROXYCA ER and then swallowing, snorting or injecting will result in the uncontrolled delivery of the oxycodone and can result in overdose and death [see  Overdosage (10)  ]  . Misuse or abuse of TROXYCA ER by these methods may also release sufficient naltrexone to precipitate withdrawal in opioid-dependent individuals [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.12)  ]  .



 Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing TROXYCA ER. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see  Patient Counseling Information (17)  ]  . Contact the local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.



    5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression



  Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see  Overdosage (10)  ]  . Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.



 While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of TROXYCA ER, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24-72 hours of initiating therapy with and following dosage increases of TROXYCA ER.



 To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of TROXYCA ER are essential [see  Dosage and Administration (2)  ]  . Overestimating the TROXYCA ER dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in fatal overdose with the first dose.



 Accidental ingestion of even one dose of TROXYCA ER, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of oxycodone.



    5.3 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome



  Prolonged use of TROXYCA ER during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ,  Patient Counseling Information (17)  ]  .



    5.4 Risks of Concomitant Use or Discontinuation of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers



  Concomitant use of TROXYCA ER with a CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may increase plasma concentrations of oxycodone and prolong opioid adverse reactions, which may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]  , particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of TROXYCA ER is achieved .  Similarly, discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inducer, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, in TROXYCA ER-treated patients may increase oxycodone plasma concentrations and prolong opioid adverse reactions. When using TROXYCA ER with CYP3A4 inhibitors or discontinuing CYP3A4 inducers in TROXYCA ER-treated patients, monitor patients closely at frequent intervals and consider dosage reduction of TROXYCA ER until stable drug effects are achieved [see  Drug Interactions (7)  ].  



 Concomitant use of TROXYCA ER with CYP3A4 inducers or discontinuation of an CYP3A4 inhibitor could decrease oxycodone plasma concentrations, decrease opioid efficacy or, possibly, lead to a withdrawal syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. When using TROXYCA ER with CYP3A4 inducers or discontinuing CYP3A4 inhibitors, monitor patients closely at frequent intervals and consider increasing the opioid dosage if needed to maintain adequate analgesia or if symptoms of opioid withdrawal occur [see  Drug Interactions (7)  ]  .



    5.5 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants



   Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of TROXYCA ER with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.  



  Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see  Drug Interactions (7)  ]  .  



  If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.  



  Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when TROXYCA ER is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [see  Drug Interactions (7)  and  Patient Counseling Information (17)  ]  .  



    5.6 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients



  The use of TROXYCA ER in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated.



  Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease  : TROXYCA ER-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of TROXYCA ER [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ].  



  Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients  : Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ].  



 Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating TROXYCA ER and when TROXYCA ER is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2  ,  5.5)  ]  . Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients.



    5.7 Adrenal Insufficiency



  Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.



    5.8 Severe Hypotension



  TROXYCA ER may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see  Drug Interactions (7)  ]  . Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of TROXYCA ER. In patients with circulatory shock, TROXYCA ER may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of TROXYCA ER in patients with circulatory shock.



    5.9 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness



  In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), TROXYCA ER may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with TROXYCA ER.



 Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of TROXYCA ER in patients with impaired consciousness or coma.



    5.10 Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions



  TROXYCA ER is contraindicated in patients with gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus.



 The oxycodone in TROXYCA ER may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms.



    5.11 Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders



  The oxycodone in TROXYCA ER may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders and may increase the risk of seizures in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during TROXYCA ER therapy.



    5.12 Withdrawal



  Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with a full opioid agonist analgesic, including TROXYCA ER. In these patients, mixed agonists/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms.



 Consuming TROXYCA ER that has been altered by crushing, chewing, or dissolving the pellets can release sufficient naltrexone to precipitate withdrawal in opioid-dependent individuals. Symptoms of withdrawal usually appear within five minutes of ingestion of naltrexone, can last for up to 48 hours, and can include mental status changes, restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Significant fluid losses from vomiting and diarrhea can require intravenous fluid administration.



 When discontinuing TROXYCA ER, gradually taper the dosage [see  Dosage and Administration (2.4)  ]  . Do not abruptly discontinue TROXYCA ER [see  Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)  ]  .



    5.13 Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery



  TROXYCA ER may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of TROXYCA ER and know how they will react to the medication [see  Patient Counseling Information (17)  ]  .



    5.14 Laboratory Tests and Monitoring



  Naltrexone does not interfere with thin-layer, gas-liquid, or high pressure liquid chromatographic methods which may be used for the separation and detection of morphine, methadone, oxycodone, or quinine in the urine. Naltrexone may or may not interfere with enzymatic methods for the detection of opioids depending on the sensitivity and specificity of the test. Consult the test manufacturer for details.



 Not every urine drug test for "opioids" or "opiates" detects oxycodone reliably, especially those designed for in-office use. Further, many laboratories will report urine drug concentrations below a specified "cut-off" value as "negative". Therefore, if urine testing for oxycodone is considered in the clinical management of an individual patient, ensure that the sensitivity and specificity of the assay is appropriate, and consider the limitations of the testing used when interpreting results.
