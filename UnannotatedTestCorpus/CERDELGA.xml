  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The most common adverse reactions to CERDELGA (occurring in &gt;=10% of the 126 GD1 patients treated with CERDELGA across Trials 1 and 2 were fatigue, headache, nausea, diarrhea, back pain, pain in extremities, and upper abdominal pain.



 The adverse reaction profile of CERDELGA is based on two controlled studies, Trials 1 and 2  [see  Clinical Studies (14.1  ,  14.2)  ]  . Table 3 presents the profile from the 9-month double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 40 treatment-naive patients (Trial 1). Patients were between the ages of 16 and 63 on the date of the first dose of study drug, and included 20 males and 20 females.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



  EXCERPT:    ECG Changes and Potential for Cardiac Arrhythmias  : Not recommended in patients with pre-existing cardiac disease, long QT syndrome, and concomitant use of Class IA and Class III antiarrhythmics. (  5.1  )



 



   5.1 ECG Changes and Potential for Cardiac Arrhythmias



   CERDELGA is predicted to cause increases in ECG intervals (PR, QTc, and QRS) at substantially elevated eliglustat plasma concentrations and may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.  



 *   Use of CERDELGA is contraindicated, to be avoided, or requires dosage adjustment in patients taking CYP2D6 or CYP3A inhibitors, depending CYP2D6 metabolizer status, type of inhibitor, or degree of hepatic impairment [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ,  Contraindications (4)  ,  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ].   
     Use of CERDELGA in patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions has not been studied during clinical trials. Avoid use of CERDELGA in patients with:  
 

 *   pre-existing cardiac disease (congestive heart failure, recent acute myocardial infarction, bradycardia, heart block, ventricular arrhythmia)  
 *   long QT syndrome  
 *   in combination with Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)  ] .
