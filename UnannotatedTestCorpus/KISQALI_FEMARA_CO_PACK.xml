  The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:



 *  QT Interval Prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]  
 *  Hepatobiliary Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]  
 *  Neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]  
      EXCERPT:   Most common adverse reactions (incidence &gt;= 20%) are neutropenia, nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, leukopenia, alopecia, vomiting, constipation, headache and back pain. (  6  )

  6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The safety data reported below are based on Study 1 (MONALEESA-2), a clinical study of 668 postmenopausal women receiving KISQALI plus letrozole or placebo plus letrozole. The median duration of exposure to KISQALI plus letrozole was 13 months with 58% of patients exposed for &gt;= 12 months.



 Dose reductions due to adverse reactions (ARs) occurred in 45% of patients receiving KISQALI plus letrozole and in 3% of patients receiving placebo plus letrozole. Permanent discontinuations due to ARs were reported in 7% of patients receiving KISQALI plus letrozole and 2% in patients receiving placebo plus letrozole. The most common ARs leading to treatment discontinuation of both KISQALI and letrozole in patients receiving KISQALI plus letrozole were ALT increased (4%), AST increased (3%), and vomiting (2%). Antiemetics and antidiarrhea medications were used to manage symptoms as clinically indicated.



 On-treatment deaths, regardless of causality, were reported in three cases (0.9%) of KISQALI plus letrozole treated patients vs. one case (0.3%) of placebo plus letrozole treated patients. Causes of death on KISQALI plus letrozole included one case each of the following: progressive disease, death (cause unknown), and sudden death (in the setting of Grade 3 hypokalemia and Grade 2 QT prolongation).



 The most common ARs (reported at a frequency &gt;= 20%) were neutropenia, nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, leukopenia, alopecia, vomiting, constipation, headache and back pain.



 The most common Grade 3/4 ARs (reported at a frequency &gt; 2%) were neutropenia, leukopenia, abnormal liver function tests, lymphopenia, and vomiting.



 ARs and laboratory abnormalities occurring in patients in Study 1 are listed in Table 6 and Table 7, respectively.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



     EXCERPT:    *   QT Interval Prolongation: Monitor electrocardiograms (ECGs) and electrolytes prior to initiation of treatment with KISQALI. Repeat ECGs at approximately Day 14 of the first cycle and at the beginning of the second cycle, and as clinically indicated. Monitor electrolytes at the beginning of each cycle for 6 cycles, and as clinically indicated. (  2.2,     5.1  ) 
 *   Hepatobiliary Toxicity: Increases in serum transaminase levels have been observed. Perform Liver Function Tests (LFTs) before initiating treatment with KISQALI FEMARA CO-PACK. Monitor LFTs every 2 weeks for the first 2 cycles, at the beginning of each subsequent 4 cycles, and as clinically indicated. (  2.2,     5.2  ) 
 *   Neutropenia: Perform Complete Blood Count (CBC) before initiating therapy with KISQALI FEMARA CO-PACK. Monitor CBC every 2 weeks for the first 2 cycles, at the beginning of each subsequent 4 cycles, and as clinically indicated. (  2.2,     5.3  ) 
 *   Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Advise women of child-bearing potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception during therapy. (  5.4  ,  8.1  ,  8.3  ) 
    
 

   5.1 QT Interval Prolongation



  KISQALI has been shown to prolong the QT interval in a concentration-dependent manner, with estimated mean increase in QTc interval exceeding 20 ms (22.9 ms (90% CI: 21.6, 24.1)) at the mean steady-state Cmaxfollowing administration at 600 mg once daily dose [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]  . In Study 1 (MONALEESA-2), one patient (0.3%) had &gt; 500 msec post-baseline QTcF value (average of triplicate), and nine patients out of 329 patients (3%) had a &gt; 60 msec increase from baseline in QTcF intervals (average of triplicate). These ECG changes occurred within the first four weeks of treatment and were reversible with dose interruption. There were no reported cases of Torsades de Pointes. Syncope occurred in 9 patients (2.7%) in the KISQALI plus letrozole arm versus 3 (0.9%) in placebo plus letrozole arm. On the KISQALI plus letrozole treatment arm, there was one (0.3%) sudden death in a patient with Grade 3 hypokalemia and Grade 2 QT prolongation [see Adverse Reactions (6)]  .



 Assess ECG prior to initiation of treatment. Initiate treatment with KISQALI FEMARA CO-PACK only in patients with QTcF values less than 450 msec. Repeat ECG at approximately Day 14 of the first cycle and the beginning of the second cycle, and as clinically indicated.



 Monitor serum electrolytes (including potassium, calcium, phosphorous and magnesium) prior to the initiation of treatment, at the beginning of the first 6 cycles, and as clinically indicated. Correct any abnormality before starting KISQALI FEMARA CO-PACK therapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].  



  Avoid the use of KISQALI FEMARA CO-PACK in patients who already have or who are at significant risk of developing QTc prolongation, including patients with:  
 

 *  long QT syndrome 
 *  uncontrolled or significant cardiac disease including recent myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, unstable angina and bradyarrhythmias 
 *  electrolyte abnormalities 
    Avoid using KISQALI FEMARA CO-PACK with drugs known to prolong QTc interval and/or strong CYP3A inhibitors as this may lead to prolongation of the QTcF interval [see Drug Interactions (7.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]  .
 

 Based on the observed QT prolongation during treatment, KISQALI may require dose interruption, reduction or discontinuation as described in Table 4     [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Drug Interactions (7.4)].  



    5.2 Hepatobiliary Toxicity



  In Study 1, increases in transaminases were observed. Grade 3 or 4 increases in ALT (10% versus 1%) and AST (7% versus 2%) were reported in the KISQALI FEMARA CO-PACK and placebo arms respectively.



 Among the patients who had Grade &gt;= 3 ALT/AST elevation, the median time-to-onset was 57 days for the KISQALI FEMARA CO-PACK treatment group. The median time to resolution to Grade &lt;= 2 was 24 days in the KISQALI plus letrozole treatment group.



 Concurrent elevations in ALT or AST greater than three times the ULN and total bilirubin greater than two times the ULN, with normal alkaline phosphatase, in the absence of cholestasis occurred in 4 (1%) patients in Study 1 and all patients recovered after discontinuation of KISQALI.



 Perform LFTs before initiating therapy with KISQALI FEMARA CO-PACK. Monitor LFTs every 2 weeks for first 2 cycles, at the beginning of each subsequent 4 cycles, and as clinically indicated [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].  



 Based on the severity of the transaminase elevations, KISQALI may require dose interruption, reduction, or discontinuation as described in Table 3 (Dose Modification and Management for Hepatobiliary toxicity) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]  . Recommendations for patients who have elevated AST/ALT Grade &gt;= 3 at baseline have not been established.



    5.3 Neutropenia



  In Study 1, neutropenia was the most frequently reported adverse reaction (75%) and a Grade 3/4 decrease in neutrophil count (based on laboratory findings) was reported in 60% of patients receiving KISQALI FEMARA CO-PACK. Among the patients who had Grade 2, 3, or 4 neutropenia, the median time to Grade &gt; 2 neutropenia was 16 days. The median time to resolution of Grade &gt;= 3 (to normalization or Grade &lt; 3) was 15 days in the KISQALI FEMARA CO-PACK treatment group. Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.5% of patients receiving KISQALI FEMARA CO-PACK. Treatment discontinuation due to neutropenia was 0.9%.



 Perform CBC before initiating therapy with KISQALI FEMARA CO-PACK. Monitor CBC every 2 weeks for the first 2 cycles, at the beginning of each subsequent 4 cycles, and as clinically indicated.



 Based on the severity of the neutropenia, KISQALI may require dose interruption, reduction or discontinuation as described in Table 2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]  .



    5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  Based on findings from animal studies and the mechanisms of action, KISQALI FEMARA CO-PACK can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.



 In animal reproduction studies, administration of ribociclib to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis caused embryo-fetal toxicities at maternal exposures that were 0.6 and 1.5 times the human clinical exposure, respectively, based on area under the curve (AUC).



 Letrozole caused embryo-fetal toxicities in rats and rabbits at maternal exposures that were below the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) on a mg/m  2  basis.



 Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise women of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during therapy with KISQALI FEMARA CO-PACK and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]  .
