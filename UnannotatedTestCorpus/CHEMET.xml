  Clinical experience with CHEMET has been limited. Consequently, the full spectrum and incidence of adverse reactions including the possibility of hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reactions have not been determined. The most common events attributable to CHEMET, i.e., gastrointestinal symptoms or increases in serum transaminases, have been observed in about 10% of patients (see  PRECAUTIONS  ). Rashes, some necessitating discontinuation of therapy, have been reported in about 4% of patients. If rash occurs, other causes (e.g. measles) should be considered before ascribing the reaction to CHEMET. Rechallenge with CHEMET may be considered if lead levels are high enough to warrant retreatment. Allergic reactions including urticaria and angioedema have been reported on repeated administration of the drug (see  PRECAUTIONS  ). Mild to moderate neutropenia has been observed in some patients receiving CHEMET (see  WARNINGS  ). Table I presents adverse events reported with the administration of CHEMET for the treatment of lead and other heavy metal intoxication.

  The extent of clinical experience with CHEMET is limited. Therefore, patients should be carefully observed during treatment.



    General:  Elevated blood lead levels and associated symptoms may return rapidly after discontinuation of CHEMET because of redistribution of lead from bone stores to soft tissues and blood. After therapy, patients should be monitored for rebound of blood lead levels, by measuring blood lead levels at least once weekly until stable. However, the severity of lead intoxication (as measured by the initial blood lead level and the rate and degree of rebound of blood lead) should be used as a guide for more frequent blood lead monitoring.



 All patients undergoing treatment should be adequately hydrated. Caution should be exercised in using CHEMET therapy in patients with compromised renal function. Limited data suggests that CHEMET is dialyzable, but that the lead chelates are not.



 Transient mild elevations of serum transaminases have been observed in 6-10% of patients during the course of CHEMET therapy. Serum transaminases should be monitored before the start of therapy and at least weekly during therapy. Patients with a history of liver disease should be monitored closely. No data are available regarding the metabolism of CHEMET in patients with liver disease.



 Clinical experience with repeated courses is limited. The safety of uninterrupted dosing longer than three weeks has not been established and it is not recommended.



 The possibility of allergic or other mucocutaneous reactions to the drug must be borne in mind on readministration (as well as during initial courses). Patients requiring repeated courses of CHEMET should be monitored during each treatment course. One patient experienced recurrent mucocutaneous vesicular eruptions of increasing severity affecting the oral mucosa, the external urethral meatus and the perianal area on the third, fourth and fifth courses of the drug. The reaction resolved between courses and upon discontinuation of therapy.



    Information for Patients:  Patients should be instructed to maintain adequate fluid intake. If rash occurs, patients should consult their physician. Patients should be instructed to promptly report any indication of infection, which may be a sign of neutropenia (see  WARNINGS  and  ADVERSE REACTIONS  ).



 In young pediatric patients unable to swallow capsules, the contents of the capsule can be administered in a small amount of food (see  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  ).



    Drug Interaction:  CHEMET is not known to interact with other drugs including iron supplements; interactions have not been systematically studied. Concomitant administration of CHEMET with other chelation therapy, such as CaNa2EDTA is not recommended.



     Drug/Laboratory Tests Interaction:  CHEMET may interfere with serum and urinary laboratory tests. In vitro  studies have shown CHEMET to cause false positive results for ketones in urine using nitroprusside reagents such as Ketostix (Ketostix is a registered trademark of Bayer Diagnostics.) and falsely decreased measurements of serum uric acid and CPK.
 

    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility:  CHEMET has not been tested for carcinogenic potential in long-term animal studies. Succimer up to a dose of 510 mg/kg/day in males and 100 mg/kg/day in females did not show any adverse effect on fertility and reproductive performance. It was not mutagenic in the Ames bacterial assay and in the mammalian cell forward gene mutation assay.



    Pregnancy:  Succimer has been shown to be teratogenic and fetotoxic in pregnant mice when given subcutaneously in a dose range of 410 to 1640 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis. In a developmental study in rats, succimer produced maternal toxicity and deaths at the dose of 720 mg/kg/day or more during organogenesis.



 The dose of 510 mg/kg/day was the highest tolerable dose in pregnant rats. Impaired development of reflexes was noted in pups of 720 mg/kg/day group dam. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. CHEMET should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.



    Nursing Mothers:  It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs and heavy metals are excreted in human milk, nursing mothers requiring CHEMET therapy should be discouraged from nursing their infants.



    Pediatric Use:  Refer to the  INDICATIONS  and  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  sections. Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients less than 12 months of age have not been established.

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings">    WARNINGS



  Keep out of reach of pediatric patients. CHEMET is not a substitute for effective abatement of lead exposure.



 Mild to moderate neutropenia has been observed in some patients receiving CHEMET. While a causal relationship to CHEMET has not been definitely established, neutropenia has been reported with other drugs in the same chemical class. A complete blood count with white blood cell differential  and direct platelet counts  should be obtained prior to and weekly during treatment with CHEMET. Therapy should either be withheld or discontinued if the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is below 1200/mcL and the patient followed closely to document recovery of the ANC to above 1500/mcL or to the patient's baseline neutrophil count. There is limited experience with reexposure in patients who have developed neutropenia. Therefore, such patients should be rechallenged only if the benefit of CHEMET therapy clearly outweighs the potential risk of another episode of neutropenia and then only with careful patient monitoring.



 Patients treated with CHEMET should be instructed to promptly report any signs of infection. If infection is suspected, the above laboratory tests should be conducted immediately.
