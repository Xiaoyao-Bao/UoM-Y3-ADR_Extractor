  6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

 Safety evaluation of TARCEVA is based on more than 1200 cancer patients who received TARCEVA as monotherapy, more than 300 patients who received TARCEVA 100 or 150 mg plus gemcitabine, and 1228 patients who received TARCEVA concurrently with other chemotherapies. The most common adverse reactions with TARCEVA are rash and diarrhea usually with onset during the first month of treatment. The incidences of rash and diarrhea from clinical studies of TARCEVA for the treatment of NSCLC and pancreatic cancer were 70% for rash and 42% for diarrhea.

   Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer  

   First-Line Treatment of Patients with EGFR Mutations  

 The most frequent (&gt;= 30%) adverse reactions in TARCEVA-treated patients were diarrhea, asthenia, rash, cough, dyspnea, and decreased appetite. In TARCEVA-treated patients the median time to onset of rash was 15 days and the median time to onset of diarrhea was 32 days.

 The most frequent Grade 3-4 adverse reactions in TARCEVA-treated patients were rash and diarrhea.

 Dose interruptions or reductions due to adverse reactions occurred in 37% of TARCEVA-treated patients, and 14.3% of TARCEVA-treated patients discontinued therapy due to adverse reactions. In TARCEVA-treated patients, the most frequently reported adverse reactions leading to dose modification were rash (13%), diarrhea (10%), and asthenia (3.6%).

 Common adverse reactions in Study 1, occurring in at least 10% of patients who received TARCEVA or chemotherapy and an increase in &gt;= 5% in the TARCEVA-treated group, are graded by National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 (NCI-CTCAE v3.0) Grade in  Table 1  . The median duration of TARCEVA treatment was 9.6 months in Study 1.

   Maintenance Treatment  

 Adverse reactions, regardless of causality, that occurred in at least 3% of patients treated with single-agent TARCEVA at 150 mg and at least 3% more often than in the placebo group in the randomized maintenance trial (Study 3) are summarized by NCI-CTCAE v3.0 Grade in  Table 2  .

 The most common adverse reactions in patients receiving single-agent TARCEVA 150 mg were rash and diarrhea. Grade 3-4 rash and diarrhea occurred in 9% and 2%, respectively, in TARCEVA-treated patients. Rash and diarrhea resulted in study discontinuation in 1% and 0.5% of TARCEVA-treated patients, respectively. Dose reduction or interruption for rash and diarrhea was needed in 5% and 3% of patients, respectively. In TARCEVA-treated patients the median time to onset of rash was 10 days, and the median time to onset of diarrhea was 15 days.

Grade 2 [&gt; 2.5 - 5.0 x upper limit of normal (ULN)] ALT elevations occurred in 4% and &lt; 1% of TARCEVA and placebo treated patients, respectively. Grade 3 (&gt; 5.0 - 20.0 x ULN) elevations were not observed in TARCEVA-treated patients. TARCEVA dosing should be interrupted or discontinued if changes in liver function are severe  [see  Dosage and Administration  (  2.4  )]  .
 

   Pancreatic Cancer - TARCEVA Administered Concurrently with Gemcitabine  

 This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of TARCEVA (150 mg or 100 mg daily) or placebo plus gemcitabine (1000 mg/m  2    by intravenous infusion) in patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic pancreatic cancer (Study 5). The safety population comprised 282 patients in the erlotinib group (259 in the 100 mg cohort and 23 in the 150 mg cohort) and 280 patients in the placebo group (256 in the 100 mg cohort and 24 in the 150 mg cohort).

 Adverse reactions that occurred in at least 10% of patients treated with TARCEVA 100 mg plus gemcitabine in the randomized trial of patients with pancreatic cancer (Study 5) were graded according to NCI-CTC v2.0 in  Table 4  .

 The most common adverse reactions in pancreatic cancer patients receiving TARCEVA 100 mg plus gemcitabine were fatigue, rash, nausea, anorexia and diarrhea. In the TARCEVA plus gemcitabine arm, Grade 3-4 rash and diarrhea were each reported in 5% of patients. The median time to onset of rash and diarrhea was 10 days and 15 days, respectively. Rash and diarrhea each resulted in dose reductions in 2% of patients, and resulted in study discontinuation in up to 1% of patients receiving TARCEVA plus gemcitabine. Severe adverse reactions (&gt;= Grade 3 NCI-CTC) in the TARCEVA plus gemcitabine group with incidences &lt; 5% included syncope, arrhythmias, ileus, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia including microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with thrombocytopenia, myocardial infarction/ischemia, cerebrovascular accidents including cerebral hemorrhage, and renal insufficiency  [see  Warnings and Precautions  (  5  )]  .

 The 150 mg cohort was associated with a higher rate of certain class-specific adverse reactions including rash and required more frequent dose reduction or interruption.

 Cases of gastrointestinal bleeding (including fatalities) have been reported, some associated with concomitant warfarin or NSAID administration  [see  Warnings and Precautions  (  5.9  ) and  Drug Interactions  (  7  )]  . These adverse reactions were reported as peptic ulcer bleeding (gastritis, gastroduodenal ulcers), hematemesis, hematochezia, melena and hemorrhage from possible colitis.

   6.2 Post-Marketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of TARCEVA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

   Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders:  myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, in combination with statin therapy

   Eye Disorders:  ocular inflammation including uveitis

   5.1 Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)

  Cases of serious ILD, including fatal cases, can occur with TARCEVA treatment. The overall incidence of ILD in approximately 32,000 TARCEVA-treated patients in uncontrolled studies and studies with concurrent chemotherapy was approximately 1.1%. In patients with ILD, the onset of symptoms was between 5 days to more than 9 months (median 39 days) after initiating TARCEVA therapy.

 Withhold TARCEVA for acute onset of new or progressive unexplained pulmonary symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, and fever pending diagnostic evaluation. If ILD is confirmed, permanently discontinue TARCEVA [see  Dosage and Administration  (  2.4  )]  .

    5.2 Renal Failure

  Hepatorenal syndrome, severe acute renal failure including fatal cases, and renal insufficiency can occur with TARCEVA treatment. Renal failure may arise from exacerbation of underlying baseline hepatic impairment or severe dehydration. The pooled incidence of severe renal impairment in the 3 monotherapy lung cancer studies was 0.5% in the TARCEVA arms and 0.8% in the control arms. The incidence of renal impairment in the pancreatic cancer study was 1.4% in the TARCEVA plus gemcitabine arm and 0.4% in the control arm. Withhold TARCEVA in patients developing severe renal impairment until renal toxicity is resolved. Perform periodic monitoring of renal function and serum electrolytes during TARCEVA treatment [see  Adverse Reactions  (  6.1  ) and  Dosage and Administration  (  2.4  )]  .

    5.3 Hepatotoxicity with or without Hepatic Impairment

  Hepatic failure and hepatorenal syndrome, including fatal cases, can occur with TARCEVA treatment in patients with normal hepatic function; the risk of hepatic toxicity is increased in patients with baseline hepatic impairment. In clinical studies where patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment were excluded, the pooled incidence of hepatic failure in the 3 monotherapy lung cancer studies was 0.4% in the TARCEVA arms and 0% in the control arms. The incidence of hepatic failure in the pancreatic cancer study was 0.4% in the TARCEVA plus gemcitabine arm and 0.4% in the control arm. In a pharmacokinetic study in 15 patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) associated with significant liver tumor burden, 10 of these 15 patients died within 30 days of the last TARCEVA dose. One patient died from hepatorenal syndrome, 1 patient died from rapidly progressing liver failure and the remaining 8 patients died from progressive disease. Six out of the 10 patients who died had baseline total bilirubin &gt; 3 x ULN.

 Perform periodic liver testing (transaminases, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase) during treatment with TARCEVA. Increased frequency of monitoring of liver function is required for patients with pre-existing hepatic impairment or biliary obstruction. Withhold TARCEVA in patients without pre-existing hepatic impairment for total bilirubin levels greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal or transaminases greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal. Withhold TARCEVA in patients with pre-existing hepatic impairment or biliary obstruction for doubling of bilirubin or tripling of transaminases values over baseline. Discontinue TARCEVA in patients whose abnormal liver tests meeting the above criteria do not improve significantly or resolve within three weeks [see  Dosage and Administration  (  2.4  ) and  Clinical Pharmacology  (  12.3  )].  

    5.4 Gastrointestinal Perforation

  Gastrointestinal perforation, including fatal cases, can occur with TARCEVA treatment. Patients receiving concomitant anti-angiogenic agents, corticosteroids, NSAIDs, or taxane-based chemotherapy, or who have prior history of peptic ulceration or diverticular disease may be at increased risk of perforation [see  Adverse Reactions  (  6.1  ,  6.2  )]  . The pooled incidence of gastrointestinal perforation in the 3 monotherapy lung cancer studies was 0.2% in the TARCEVA arms and 0.1% in the control arms. The incidence of gastrointestinal perforation in the pancreatic cancer study was 0.4% in the TARCEVA plus gemcitabine arm and 0% in the control arm. Permanently discontinue TARCEVA in patients who develop gastrointestinal perforation [see  Dosage and Administration  (  2.4  )]  .

    5.5 Bullous and Exfoliative Skin Disorders

  Bullous, blistering and exfoliative skin conditions, including cases suggestive of Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, which in some cases were fatal, can occur with TARCEVA treatment [see  Adverse Reactions  (  6.1  ,  6.2  )]  . The pooled incidence of bullous and exfoliative skin disorders in the 3 monotherapy lung cancer studies was 1.2% in the TARCEVA arms and 0% in the control arms. The incidence of bullous and exfoliative skin disorders in the pancreatic cancer study was 0.4% in the TARCEVA plus gemcitabine arm and 0% in the control arm. Discontinue TARCEVA treatment if the patient develops severe bullous, blistering or exfoliating conditions [see  Dosage and Administration  (  2.4  )]  .

     5.6 Cerebrovascular Accident  

   In the pancreatic carcinoma trial, seven patients in the TARCEVA/gemcitabine group developed cerebrovascular accidents (incidence: 2.5%). One of these was hemorrhagic and was the only fatal event. In comparison, in the placebo/gemcitabine group there were no cerebrovascular accidents. The pooled incidence of cerebrovascular accident in the 3 monotherapy lung cancer studies was 0.6% in the TARCEVA arms and not higher than that observed in the control arms.  

    5.7 Microangiopathic Hemolytic Anemia with Thrombocytopenia

  The pooled incidence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with thrombocytopenia in the 3 monotherapy lung cancer studies was 0% in the TARCEVA arms and 0.1% in the control arms. The incidence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with thrombocytopenia in the pancreatic cancer study was 1.4% in the TARCEVA plus gemcitabine arm and 0% in the control arm.

    5.8 Ocular Disorders

  Decreased tear production, abnormal eyelash growth, keratoconjunctivitis sicca or keratitis can occur with TARCEVA treatment and can lead to corneal perforation or ulceration [see  Adverse Reactions  (  6.1  ) and (  6.2  )]  . The pooled incidence of ocular disorders in the 3 monotherapy lung cancer studies was 17.8% in the TARCEVA arms and 4% in the control arms. The incidence of ocular disorders in the pancreatic cancer study was 12.8% in the TARCEVA plus gemcitabine arm and 11.4% in the control arm. Interrupt or discontinue TARCEVA therapy if patients present with acute or worsening ocular disorders such as eye pain [see  Dosage and Administration  (  2.4  )]  .

    5.9 Hemorrhage in Patients Taking Warfarin

  Severe and fatal hemorrhage associated with International Normalized Ratio (INR) elevations can occur when TARCEVA and warfarin are administered concurrently. Regularly monitor prothrombin time and INR during TARCEVA treatment in patients taking warfarin or other coumarin-derivative anticoagulants [see  Adverse Reactions  (  6.1  ) and  Drug Interactions  (  7  )]  .

     5.10 Embryo-fetal Toxicity  

   Based on animal data and its mechanism of action, TARCEVA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. When given during organogenesis, erlotinib administration resulted in embryo-fetal lethality and abortion in rabbits at exposures approximately 3 times the exposure at the recommended human daily dose of 150 mg. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.  

  Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during therapy and for one month after the last dose of TARCEVA [see  Use in Specific Populations  (  8.1  ) and (        8.3        ),  Clinical Pharmacology  (  12.1  )]  .
