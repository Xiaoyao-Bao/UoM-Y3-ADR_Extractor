  6.1 Clinical Studies Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 In a controlled clinical study, 304 patients were treated with Testim 50 mg or 100 mg or placebo gel for up to 90 days. Two hundred five (205) patients received Testim 50 mg or 100 mg daily and 99 patients received placebo.  Subjects could be counted in both Testim treatment groups if they received both 50 mg and 100 mg at different points in the study and experienced an adverse reaction at both dose levels. Adverse reactions reported by &gt;=1% of the Testim patients and greater than placebo are listed in Table 1.

  Spontaneous PenileErection   1%   0%   0%   
  Taste Disorder   1%   1%   0%   
          The following adverse reactions occurred in fewer than 1% of patients but were greater in Testim groups compared to the placebo group: activated partial thromboplastin time prolonged, blood creatinine increased, prothrombin time prolonged, appetite increased, sensitive nipples, and acne.
 

 In this clinical trial of Testim, six patients had adverse reactions that led to their discontinuation. These events included:  depression with suicidal ideation, urinary tract infection, mood swings and hypertension. No Testim patients discontinued due to skin reaction.  In one foreign Phase 3 trial, one subject discontinued due to a skin-related adverse reaction.



 In the pivotal U.S. and European Phase 3 trials combined, at the 50 mg dosage strength, the percentage of subjects reporting clinically notable increases in hematocrit or hemoglobin were similar to placebo. However, in the 100 mg dose group, 2.3% and 2.8% of patients had a clinically notable increase in hemoglobin (&gt;= 19 g/dL) or hematocrit (&gt;= 58%), respectively, compared to 1.0% and 1.5% of patients in the placebo group, respectively.



 In the combined US and European open label extension studies, approximately 140 patients received Testim for at least 6 months. The results from these studies are consistent with those reported for the US controlled clinical trial.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of testosterone gel products.  Because the reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



     Secondary Exposure to Testosterone in Children    



 Cases of secondary exposure to testosterone resulting in virilization of children have been reported in postmarketing surveillance of testosterone gel products.  Signs and symptoms of these reported cases have included enlargement of the clitoris (with surgical intervention) or of the penis, development of pubic hair, increased erections and libido, aggressive behavior, and advanced bone age.  In most cases with a reported outcome, these signs and symptoms were reported to have regressed with removal of the testosterone gel exposure.  In a few cases, however, enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age-appropriate normal size, and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age.  In some of the cases, direct contact with the sites of application on the skin of men using testosterone gel was reported.  In at least one reported case, the reporter considered the possibility of secondary exposure from items such as the testosterone gel user's shirts and/or other fabrics, such as towels and sheets  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )]  .

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings and precautions">    5  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Monitor patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH. (  5.1  ) 
 *  Avoid unintentional exposure of women or children to Testim. Secondary exposure to testosterone can produce signs of virilization. Testim should be discontinued until the cause of virilization is identified. (  5.2  ) 
 *  Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), have been reported in patients using testosterone products. Evaluate patients with signs or symptoms consistent with DVT or PE. (  5.4  ) 
 *  Some postmarketing studies have shown an increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke associated with use of testosterone replacement therapy. (  5.5  ) 
 *  Exogenous administration of androgens may lead to azoospermia. (  5.8  ) 
 *  Edema, with or without congestive heart failure, may be a complication in patients with preexisting cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease. (  5.10  ,  6.2  ) 
 *  Sleep apnea may occur in those with risk factors. (  5.12  ) 
 *  Monitor prostate specific antigen (PSA), hematocrit, and lipid concentrations periodically. (  5.1  ,  5.3  ,  5.13   ) 
 *  Testim is flammable until dry. (  5.16   ) 
    
 

   5.1 Worsening of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) and Potential Risk of Prostate Cancer



    *  Patients with BPH treated with androgens are at an increased risk for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH. Monitor patients with BPH for worsening signs and symptoms. 
 *  Patients treated with androgens may be at increased risk for prostate cancer. Evaluate patients for prostate cancer prior to initiating and during treatment with androgens [see Contraindications (  4  )] . 
       5.2 Potential for Secondary Exposure to Testosterone
 

  Cases of secondary exposure resulting in virilization of children have been reported in postmarketing surveillance. Signs and symptoms have included enlargement of the penis or clitoris, development of pubic hair, increased erections and libido, aggressive behavior, and advanced bone age. In most cases, these signs and symptoms regressed with removal of the exposure to testosterone gel. In a few cases, however, enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age-appropriate normal size, and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age. The risk of transfer was increased in some of these cases by not adhering to precautions for the appropriate use of the topical testosterone product. Children and women should avoid contact with unwashed or unclothed application sites in men using Testim [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  ), Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  ) and Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )]  .



 Inappropriate changes in genital size or development of pubic hair or libido in children, or changes in body hair distribution, significant increase in acne, or other signs of virilization in adult women should be brought to the attention of a physician and the possibility of secondary exposure to testosterone gel should also be brought to the attention of a physician. Testosterone gel should be promptly discontinued until the cause of virilization has been identified.



    5.3 Polycythemia



  Increases in hematocrit, reflective of increases in red blood cell mass, may require lowering or discontinuation of testosterone. Check hematocrit prior to initiating treatment. It would also be appropriate to re-evaluate the hematocrit 3 to 6 months after starting treatment, and then annually. If hematocrit becomes elevated, stop therapy until hematocrit decreases to an acceptable concentration. An increase in red blood cell mass may increase the risk of thromboembolic events.



    5.4 Venous Thromboembolism



  There have been postmarketing reports of venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients using testosterone products, such as Testim. Evaluate patients who report symptoms of pain, edema, warmth and erythema in the lower extremity for DVT and those who present with acute shortness of breath for PE. If a venous thromboembolic event is suspected, discontinue treatment with Testim and initiate appropriate workup and management [see Adverse Reactions (  6.2  )]  .



    5.5 Cardiovascular Risk



  Long term clinical safety trials have not been conducted to assess the cardiovascular outcomes of testosterone replacement therapy in men. To date, epidemiologic studies and randomized controlled trials have been inconclusive for determining the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), such as non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and cardiovascular death, with the use of testosterone compared to non-use. Some studies, but not all, have reported an increased risk of MACE in association with use of testosterone replacement therapy in men. Patients should be informed of this possible risk when deciding whether to use or to continue to use Testim.



    5.6 Abuse of Testosterone and Monitoring of Serum Testosterone Concentrations



  Testosterone has been subject to abuse, typically at doses higher than recommended for the approved indication and in combination with other anabolic androgenic steroids. Anabolic androgenic steroid abuse can lead to serious cardiovascular and psychiatric adverse reactions  [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (  9  )].  



 If testosterone abuse is suspected, check serum testosterone concentrations to ensure they are within therapeutic range. However, testosterone levels may be in the normal or subnormal range in men abusing synthetic testosterone derivatives. Counsel patients concerning the serious adverse reactions associated with abuse of testosterone and anabolic androgenic steroids. Conversely, consider the possibility of testosterone and anabolic androgenic steroid abuse in suspected patients who present with serious cardiovascular or psychiatric adverse events.



    5.7 Use in Women



  Due to lack of controlled evaluations in women and potential virilizing effects, Testim is not indicated for use in women [see Contraindications (  4  ) and Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  ,  8.3  )]  .



    5.8 Potential for Adverse Effects on Spermatogenesis



  With large doses of exogenous androgens, including Testim, spermatogenesis may be suppressed through feedback inhibition of pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) which could possibly lead to adverse effects on semen parameters including sperm count.



    5.9 Hepatic Adverse Effects



  Prolonged use of high doses of orally active 17-alpha-alkyl androgens (e.g., methyltestosterone) has been associated with serious hepatic adverse effects (peliosis hepatis, hepatic neoplasms, cholestatic hepatitis, and jaundice).  Peliosis hepatis can be a life-threatening or fatal complication.  Long-term therapy with intramuscular testosterone enanthate, which elevates blood levels for prolonged periods, has produced multiple hepatic adenomas.  Testim is not known to cause these adverse effects.  Nonetheless, patients should be instructed to report any signs or symptoms of hepatic dysfunction (e.g., jaundice).  If these occur, promptly discontinue Testim while the cause is evaluated.



    5.10 Edema



  Androgens, including Testim, may promote retention of sodium and water. Edema, with or without congestive heart failure, may be a serious complication in patients with preexisting cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease.  In addition to discontinuation of the drug, diuretic therapy may be required.



    5.11 Gynecomastia



  Gynecomastia occasionally develops and occasionally persists in patients being treated for hypogonadism [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  .



    5.12 Sleep Apnea



  The treatment of hypogonadal men with testosterone may potentiate sleep apnea in some patients, especially those with risk factors such as obesity or chronic lung diseases.



    5.13 Lipids



  Changes in the serum lipid profile may occur. Monitor the lipid profile periodically, particularly after starting testosterone therapy and after dose increases.



    5.14 Hypercalcemia



  Androgens, including Testim, should be used with caution in cancer patients at risk of hypercalcemia (and associated hypercalciuria). Regular monitoring of serum calcium concentrations is recommended in these patients.



    5.15 Decreased Thyroxine-binding Globulin



  Androgens, including Testim, may decrease concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulins, resulting in decreased total T4 serum concentrations and increased resin uptake of T3 and T4. Free thyroid hormone concentrations remain unchanged, however, and there is no clinical evidence of thyroid dysfunction.



    5.16 Flammability



   Alcohol-based products, including Testim, are flammable; therefore, patients should be advised to avoid fire, flame or smoking until the Testim has dried.
