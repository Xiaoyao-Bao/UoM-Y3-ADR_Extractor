  Due to oral doxycycline's virtually complete absorption, side effects to the lower bowel, particularly diarrhea, have been infrequent. The following adverse reactions have been observed in patients receiving tetracyclines:



 Gastrointestinal: Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, glossitis, dysphagia, enterocolitis, and inflammatory lesions (with monilial overgrowth) in the anogenital region. Hepatotoxicity has been reported rarely. These reactions have been caused by both the oral and parenteral administration of tetracyclines. Rare instances of esophagitis and esophageal ulcerations have been reported in patients receiving capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline class. Most of these patients took medications immediately before going to bed (see   DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  ).



 Skin: Maculopapular and erythematous rashes. Exfoliative dermatitis has been reported but is uncommon. Photosensitivity is discussed above (see   WARNINGS  ).



 Renal toxicity: Rise in BUN has been reported and is apparently dose-related (see   WARNINGS  ).



 Hypersensitivity reactions: Urticaria, angioneurotic edema, anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid purpura, serum sickness, pericarditis, and exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus.



 Blood: Hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and eosinophilia have been reported.



 Other: Bulging fontanels in infants and benign intracranial hypertension in adults (See   PRECAUTIONS-General  :).



 When given over prolonged periods, tetracyclines have been reported to produce brown-black microscopic discoloration of thyroid glands. No abnormalities of thyroid function are known to occur.

    <Section id="S2" name="precautions">     PRECAUTIONS  



    General:  



  As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.



 Bulging fontanels in infants and benign intracranial hypertension in adults have been reported in individuals receiving tetracyclines. These conditions disappeared when the drug was discontinued.



 Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy, when indicated.



 Doxycycline offers substantial but not complete suppression of the asexual blood stages of  Plasmodium  



 strains.



 Doxycycline does not suppress  P.       falciparum's      sexual blood stage gametocytes. Subjects completing this prophylactic regimen may still transmit the infection to mosquitoes outside endemic areas.



 Prescribing DORYX in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.



     Information for Patients:  



  Patients taking doxycycline for malaria prophylaxis should be advised:



 that no present-day antimalarial agent, including doxycycline, guarantees protection against malaria. to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes by using personal protective measures that help avoid contact with mosquitoes, especially from dusk to dawn (e.g., staying in well-screened areas, using mosquito nets, covering the body with clothing, and using an effective insect repellant).



 that doxycycline prophylaxis:



 should begin 1-2 days before travel to the malarious area,



 should be continued daily while in the malarious area and after leaving the malarious area, should be continued for 4 further weeks to avoid development of malaria after returning from an endemic area,



 should not exceed 4 months.



 All patients taking doxycycline should be advised:



 to avoid excessive sunlight or artificial ultraviolet light while receiving doxycycline and to discontinue therapy if phototoxicity (e.g., skin eruptions, etc.) occurs. Sunscreen or sunblock should be considered (See   WARNINGS  ).



 to drink fluids liberally along with doxycycline to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration (See   ADVERSE REACTIONS  ).



 that the absorption of tetracyclines is reduced when taken with foods, especially those that contain calcium. However, the absorption of doxycycline is not markedly influenced by simultaneous ingestion of food or milk. (See Drug interactions).



 that the absorption of tetracyclines is reduced when taking bismuth subsalicylate (See Drug interactions).



 that the use of doxycycline might increase the incidence of vaginal candidiasis.



 Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.



 Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including DORYX should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When DORYX is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and



 (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by DORYX or other antibacterial drugs in the future.



     Laboratory tests  



  In venereal disease when coexistent syphilis is suspected, dark-field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least 4 months.



 In long-term therapy, periodic laboratory evaluation of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal and hepatic studies should be performed.



     Drug interactions  



  Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage.



 Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracyclines in conjunction with penicillin.



 Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations.



 Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by bismuth subsalicylate.



 Barbiturates, carbamazepine, and phenytoin decrease the half-life of doxycycline.



 The concurrent use of tetracycline and Penthrane  (r)       (methoxyflurane) has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity.



 Concurrent use of tetracycline may render oral contraceptives less effective.



     Drug/Laboratory Test Interaction  



  False elevations of urinary catecholamines may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test.



     Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  



  Long-term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential of doxycycline have not been conducted. However, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with the related antibiotics, oxytetracycline (adrenal and pituitary tumors) and minocycline (thyroid tumors).



 Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of doxycycline have not been conducted, positive results in  in       vitro      mammalian cell assays have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline, oxytetracycline).



 Doxycycline administered orally at dosage levels as high as 250 mg/kg/day had no apparent effect on the fertility of female rats. Effect on male fertility has not been studied.



     Pregnancy  



  Teratogenic Effects. Pregnancy Category D:



 There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of doxycycline in pregnant women. The vast majority of reported experience with doxycycline during human pregnancy is short-term, first trimester exposure. There are no human data available to assess the effects of long-term therapy of doxycycline in pregnant women such as that proposed for the treatment of anthrax exposure. An expert review of published data on experiences with doxycycline use during pregnancy by TERIS - the Teratogen Information System - concluded that therapeutic doses during pregnancy are unlikely to pose a substantial teratogenic risk (the quantity and quality of data were assessed as limited to fair), but the data are insufficient to state that there is no risk  3  .



 A case-control study (18,515 mothers of infants with congenital anomalies and 32,804 mothers of infants with no congenital anomalies) shows a weak but marginally statistically significant association with total malformations and use of doxycycline anytime during pregnancy. Sixty-three (0.19%) of the controls and 56 (0.30%) of the cases were treated with doxycycline. This association was not seen when the analysis was confined to maternal treatment during the period of organogenesis (i.e., in the second and third months of gestation) with the exception of a marginal relationship with neural tube defect based on only two exposed cases  4  .



 A small prospective study of 81 pregnancies describes 43 pregnant women treated for 10 days with doxycycline during early first trimester. All mothers reported their exposed infants were normal at 1 year of age  5  .



 Nonteratogenic effects:



  (See WARNINGS).



     Labor and Delivery  



  The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown.



     Nursing Mothers  



  Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk, however, the extent of absorption of tetracyclines including doxycycline, by the breastfed infant is not known. Short-term use by lactating women is not necessarily contraindicated; however, the effects of prolonged exposure to doxycycline in breast milk are unknown  6  . Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from doxycycline, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. (See WARNINGS.)



     Pediatric use  



  See WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.



     Geriatric use  



  Clinical studies with DORYX did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of the decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings">     WARNINGS  



  THE USE OF DRUGS OF THE TETRACYCLINE CLASS DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT (LAST HALF OF PREGNANCY, INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD TO THE AGE OF 8 YEARS) MAY CAUSE PERMANENT DISCOLORATION OF THE TEETH (YELLOW-GRAY-BROWN). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drugs but it has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. TETRACYCLINE DRUGS, THEREFORE, SHOULD NOT BE USED IN THIS AGE GROUP, EXCEPT FOR ANTHRAX, INCLUDING INHALATIONAL ANTHRAX (POST-EXPOSURE), UNLESS OTHER DRUGS ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE EFFECTIVE OR ARE CONTRAINDICATED.



  Clostridium       difficile      associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including DORYX  (r)       Capsules, 75 mg and 100 mg, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of  C.       difficile.  



  C.       difficile      produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of  C.       difficile      cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.



 If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against  C.       difficile      may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of  C.       difficile  , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.



 All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in prematures given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued.



 Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development).



 Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs, the patient should be apprised of potential hazard to the fetus.



 The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. Studies to date indicate that this does not occur with the use of doxycycline in patients with impaired renal function.



 Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema.
