  6.1 Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     Adverse Reactions in Adults Patients with CKD  

  The frequency of adverse reactions associated with the use of Venofer has been documented in six clinical trials involving 231 patients with HDD-CKD, 139 patients with NDD-CKD and 75 patients with PDD-CKD. Adverse reactions reported by &gt;= 2% of treated patients in the six clinical trials for which the rate for Venofer exceeds the rate for comparator are listed by indication in Table 1. Patients with HDD-CKD received 100 mg doses at 10 consecutive dialysis sessions until a cumulative dose of 1000 mg was administered. Patients with NDD-CKD received either 5 doses of 200 mg over 2 weeks or 2 doses of 500 mg separated by fourteen days, and patients with PDD-CKD received 2 doses of 300 mg followed by a dose of 400 mg over a period of 4 weeks.

            One hundred thirty (11%) of the 1,151 patients evaluated in the 4 U.S. trials in HDD-CKD patients (studies A, B and the two post marketing studies) had prior other intravenous iron therapy and were reported to be intolerant (defined as precluding further use of that iron product). When these patients were treated with Venofer there were no occurrences of adverse reactions that precluded further use of Venofer  [see Warning and Precautions (  5  )].  
 

     Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients with CKD (ages 2 years and older)  

  In a randomized, open-label, dose-ranging trial for iron maintenance treatment with Venofer in pediatric patients with CKD on stable erythropoietin therapy  [see Clinical Studies (  14.7  )]  , at least one adverse reaction was experienced by 57% (27/47) of the patients receiving Venofer 0.5 mg/kg, 53% (25/47) of the patients receiving Venofer 1 mg/kg, and 55% (26/47) of the patients receiving Venofer 2 mg/kg.



 A total of 5 (11%) subjects in the Venofer 0.5 mg/kg group, 10 (21%) patients in the Venofer 1 mg/kg group, and 10 (21%) patients in the Venofer 2 mg/kg group experienced at least 1 serious adverse reaction during the study. The most common adverse reactions (&gt; 2% of patients) in all patients were headache (6%), respiratory tract viral infection (4%), peritonitis (4%), vomiting (4%), pyrexia (4%), dizziness (4%), cough (4%), nausea (3%), arteriovenous fistula thrombosis (2%), hypotension (2%), and hypertension (2.1%).



   6.2 Adverse Reactions from Post-Marketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Venofer.  Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 In the post-marketing safety studies in 1,051 treated patients with HDD-CKD, the adverse reactions reported by &gt; 1% were: cardiac failure congestive, sepsis and dysgeusia.

}} Symptoms associated with Venofer total dosage or infusing too rapidly included hypotension, dyspnea, headache, vomiting, nausea, dizziness, joint aches, paresthesia, abdominal and muscle pain, edema, and cardiovascular collapse. These adverse reactions have occurred up to 30 minutes after the administration of Venofer injection. Reactions have occurred following the first dose or subsequent doses of Venofer. Symptoms may respond to intravenous fluids, hydrocortisone, and/or antihistamines. Slowing the infusion rate may alleviate symptoms.



 Injection site discoloration has been reported following extravasation. Assure stable intravenous access to avoid extravasation.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Hypersensitivity Reactions: Observe for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity during and after administration for at least 30 minutes and until clinically stable following completion of each administration. Only administer when personnel and therapies are immediately available for the treatment of serious hypersensitivity reactions. (  5.1  ) 
 *  Hypotension: May cause hypotension. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension during and following each administration. (  5.2  ) 
 *  Iron Overload: Regularly monitor hematologic responses during therapy. Do not administer to patients with iron overload. (  5.3  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions



  Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic-type reactions, some of which have been life-threatening and fatal, have been reported in patients receiving Venofer. Patients may present with shock, clinically significant hypotension, loss of consciousness, and/or collapse. If hypersensitivity reactions or signs of intolerance occur during administration, stop Venofer immediately. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity during and after Venofer administration for at least 30 minutes and until clinically stable following completion of the infusion. Only administer Venofer when personnel and therapies are immediately available for the treatment of serious hypersensitivity reactions. Most reactions associated with intravenous iron preparations occur within 30 minutes of the completion of the infusion [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  and  6.2  )].  



    5.2 Hypotension



  Venofer may cause clinically significant hypotension. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension following each administration of Venofer. Hypotension following administration of Venofer may be related to the rate of administration and/or total dose administered [see Dosage and Administration (  2  ), Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  ), and Adverse Reactions (  6.2  )].  



    5.3 Iron Overload



  Excessive therapy with parenteral iron can lead to excess storage of iron with the possibility of iatrogenic hemosiderosis. All adult and pediatric patients receiving Venofer require periodic monitoring of hematologic and iron parameters (hemoglobin, hematocrit, serum ferritin and transferrin saturation). Do not administer Venofer to patients with evidence of iron overload. Transferrin saturation (TSAT) values increase rapidly after intravenous administration of iron sucrose; do not perform serum iron measurements for at least 48 hours after intravenous dosing [see Dosage and Administration (  2  ) and Overdosage (  10  )].
