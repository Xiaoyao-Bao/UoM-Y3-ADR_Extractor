  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 SPORANOX  (r)  has been associated with rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death. Some of these cases had neither pre-existing liver disease nor a serious underlying medical condition. If clinical signs or symptoms develop that are consistent with liver disease, treatment should be discontinued and liver function testing performed. The risks and benefits of SPORANOX  (r)  use should be reassessed. (See  WARNINGS: Hepatic Effects  and  PRECAUTIONS: Hepatotoxicity  and  Information for Patients  .)



   Adverse Events in the Treatment of Systemic Fungal Infections

  Adverse event data were derived from 602 patients treated for systemic fungal disease in U.S. clinical trials who were immunocompromised or receiving multiple concomitant medications. Treatment was discontinued in 10.5% of patients due to adverse events. The median duration before discontinuation of therapy was 81 days (range: 2 to 776 days). The table lists adverse events reported by at least 1% of patients.

    BOXED WARNING  

  Congestive Heart Failure, Cardiac Effects and Drug Interactions

    SPORANOX  (r)   (itraconazole) Capsules should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis in patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction such as congestive heart failure (CHF) or a history of CHF  . If signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure occur during administration of SPORANOX  (r)   Capsules, discontinue administration. When itraconazole was administered intravenously to dogs and healthy human volunteers, negative inotropic effects were seen. (See   CONTRAINDICATIONS  ,   WARNINGS  ,   PRECAUTIONS. Drug Interactions  ,   ADVERSE REACTIONS: Post-marketing Experience  , and   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations   for more information.)



   Drug Interactions

    Coadministration of the following drugs are contraindicated with SPORANOX  (r)   Capsules: methadone, disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine, isavuconazole, ergot alkaloids (such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine (ergonovine), ergotamine, methylergometrine (methylergonovine)), irinotecan, lurasidone, oral midazolam, pimozide, triazolam, felodipine, nisoldipine, ivabradine, ranolazine, eplerenone, cisapride, naloxegol, lomitapide, lovastatin, simvastatin, avanafil, ticagrelor. In addition, coadministration with colchicine, fesoterodine and solifenacin is contraindicated in subjects with varying degrees of renal or hepatic impairment, and coadministration with eliglustat is contraindicated in subjects that are poor or intermediate metabolizers of CYP2D6 and in subjects taking strong or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitors. See   PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions   Section for specific examples. Coadministration with itraconazole can cause elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs and may increase or prolong both the pharmacologic effects and/or adverse reactions to these drugs. For example, increased plasma concentrations of some of these drugs can lead to QT prolongation and ventricular tachyarrhythmias including occurrences of   torsades de pointes  , a potentially fatal arrhythmia. See   CONTRAINDICATIONS   and   WARNINGS   Sections, and   PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions   Section for specific examples.

    <Section id="S3" name="precautions">    PRECAUTIONS



   General



  SPORANOX  (r)  (itraconazole) Capsules should be administered after a full meal. (See  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism  ).



 Under fasted conditions, itraconazole absorption was decreased in the presence of decreased gastric acidity. The absorption of itraconazole may be decreased with the concomitant administration of antacids or gastric acid secretion suppressors. Studies conducted under fasted conditions demonstrated that administration with 8 ounces of a non-diet cola beverage resulted in increased absorption of itraconazole in AIDS patients with relative or absolute achlorhydria. This increase relative to the effects of a full meal is unknown. (See  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism  ).



    Hepatotoxicity



  Rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity have been observed with SPORANOX  (r)  treatment, including some cases within the first week. It is recommended that liver function monitoring be considered in all patients receiving SPORANOX  (r)  . Treatment should be stopped immediately and liver function testing should be conducted in patients who develop signs and symptoms suggestive of liver dysfunction.



    Neuropathy



  If neuropathy occurs that may be attributable to SPORANOX  (r)  Capsules, the treatment should be discontinued.



    Immunocompromised Patients



  In some immunocompromised patients (e.g., neutropenic, AIDS or organ transplant patients), the oral bioavailability of SPORANOX  (r)  capsules may be decreased. Therefore, the dose should be adjusted based on the clinical response in these patients.



    Cystic Fibrosis



  If a cystic fibrosis patient does not respond to SPORANOX  (r)  Capsules, consideration should be given to switching to alternative therapy. For more information concerning the use of itraconazole in cystic fibrosis patients see the prescribing information for SPORANOX  (r)  Oral Solution.



    Hearing Loss



  Transient or permanent hearing loss has been reported in patients receiving treatment with itraconazole. Several of these reports included concurrent administration of quinidine which is contraindicated (See  BOXED WARNING: Drug Interactions  ,  CONTRAINDICATIONS: Drug Interactions  and  PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions  ). The hearing loss usually resolves when treatment is stopped, but can persist in some patients.



    Information for Patients



    *  The topical effects of mucosal exposure may be different between the SPORANOX  (r)  Capsules and Oral Solution. Only the Oral Solution has been demonstrated effective for oral and/or esophageal candidiasis. SPORANOX  (r)  Capsules should not be used interchangeably with SPORANOX  (r)  Oral Solution. 
 *  Instruct patients to take SPORANOX  (r)  Capsules with a full meal. SPORANOX  (r)  Capsules must be swallowed whole. 
 *  Instruct patients about the signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, and if these signs or symptoms occur during SPORANOX  (r)  administration, they should discontinue SPORANOX  (r)  and contact their healthcare provider immediately. 
 *  Instruct patients to stop SPORANOX  (r)  treatment immediately and contact their healthcare provider if any signs and symptoms suggestive of liver dysfunction develop. Such signs and symptoms may include unusual fatigue, anorexia, nausea and/or vomiting, jaundice, dark urine, or pale stools. 
 *  Instruct patients to contact their physician before taking any concomitant medications with itraconazole to ensure there are no potential drug interactions. 
 *  Instruct patients that hearing loss can occur with the use of itraconazole. The hearing loss usually resolves when treatment is stopped, but can persist in some patients. Advise patients to discontinue therapy and inform their physicians if any hearing loss symptoms occur. 
 *  Instruct patients that dizziness or blurred/double vision can sometimes occur with itraconazole. Advise patients that if they experience these events, they should not drive or use machines. 
       Drug Interactions
 

   Effect of SPORANOX  (r)  on Other Drugs



  Itraconazole and its major metabolite, hydroxy-itraconazole, are potent CYP3A4 inhibitors. Itraconazole is an inhibitor of the drug transporters P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Consequently, SPORANOX  (r)  has the potential to interact with many concomitant drugs resulting in either increased or sometimes decreased concentrations of the concomitant drugs. Increased concentrations may increase the risk of adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drug which can be severe or life-threatening in some cases (e.g., QT prolongation, Torsade de Pointes  , respiratory depression, hepatic adverse reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, myelosuppression, hypotension, seizures, angioedema, atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, priapism). Reduced concentrations of concomitant drugs may reduce their efficacy. Table 1 lists examples of drugs that may have their concentrations affected by itraconazole, but is not a comprehensive list. Refer to the approved product labeling to become familiar with the interaction pathways, risk potential, and specific actions to be taken with regards to each concomitant drug prior to initiating therapy with SPORANOX  (r)  .



 Although many of the clinical drug interactions in Table 1 are based on information with a similar azole antifungal, ketoconazole, these interactions are expected to occur with SPORANOX  (r)  .

            Effect of Other Drugs on SPORANOX  (r)  
 

  Itraconazole is mainly metabolized through CYP3A4. Other substances that either share this metabolic pathway or modify CYP3A4 activity may influence the pharmacokinetics of itraconazole. Some concomitant drugs have the potential to interact with SPORANOX  (r)  resulting in either increased or sometimes decreased concentrations of SPORANOX  (r)  . Increased concentrations may increase the risk of adverse reactions associated with SPORANOX  (r)  . Decreased concentrations may reduce SPORANOX  (r)  efficacy.



 Table 2 lists examples of drugs that may affect itraconazole concentrations, but is not a comprehensive list. Refer to the approved product labeling to become familiar with the interaction pathways, risk potential and specific actions to be taken with regards to each concomitant drug prior to initiating therapy with SPORANOX  (r)  .



 Although many of the clinical drug interactions in Table 2 are based on information with a similar azole antifungal, ketoconazole, these interactions are expected to occur with SPORANOX  (r)  .

           Pediatric Population
 

  Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility



  Itraconazole showed no evidence of carcinogenicity potential in mice treated orally for 23 months at dosage levels up to 80 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD]). Male rats treated with 25 mg/kg/day (3.1 times the MRHD) had a slightly increased incidence of soft tissue sarcoma. These sarcomas may have been a consequence of hypercholesterolemia, which is a response of rats, but not dogs or humans, to chronic itraconazole administration. Female rats treated with 50 mg/kg/day (6.25 times the MRHD) had an increased incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (2/50) as compared to the untreated group. Although the occurrence of squamous cell carcinoma in the lung is extremely uncommon in untreated rats, the increase in this study was not statistically significant.



 Itraconazole produced no mutagenic effects when assayed in DNA repair test (unscheduled DNA synthesis) in primary rat hepatocytes, in Ames tests with Salmonella typhimurium  (6 strains) and Escherichia coli  , in the mouse lymphoma gene mutation tests, in a sex-linked recessive lethal mutation ( Drosophila melanogaster  ) test, in chromosome aberration tests in human lymphocytes, in a cell transformation test with C3H/10T1/2 C18 mouse embryo fibroblasts cells, in a dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice, and in micronucleus tests in mice and rats.



 Itraconazole did not affect the fertility of male or female rats treated orally with dosage levels of up to 40.mg/kg/day (5 times the MRHD), even though parental toxicity was present at this dosage level. More severe signs of parental toxicity, including death, were present in the next higher dosage level, 160 mg/kg/day (20 times the MRHD).



    Pregnancy



   Teratogenic effects



  Itraconazole was found to cause a dose-related increase in maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats at dosage levels of approximately 40-160 mg/kg/day (5-20 times the MRHD), and in mice at dosage levels of approximately 80 mg/kg/day (10 times the MRHD). Itraconazole has been shown to cross the placenta in a rat model. In rats, the teratogenicity consisted of major skeletal defects; in mice, it consisted of encephaloceles and/or macroglossia.



 There are no studies in pregnant women. SPORANOX  (r)  should be used for the treatment of systemic fungal infections in pregnancy only if the benefit outweighs the potential risk.



 SPORANOX  (r)  should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis to pregnant patients or to women contemplating pregnancy. SPORANOX  (r)  should not be administered to women of childbearing potential for the treatment of onychomycosis unless they are using effective measures to prevent pregnancy and they begin therapy on the second or third day following the onset of menses. Effective contraception should be continued throughout SPORANOX  (r)  therapy and for 2 months following the end of treatment.



 During post-marketing experience, cases of congenital abnormalities have been reported. (See  ADVERSE REACTIONS: Post-marketing Experience  .)



    Nursing Mothers



  Itraconazole is excreted in human milk; therefore, the expected benefits of SPORANOX  (r)  therapy for the mother should be weighed against the potential risk from exposure of itraconazole to the infant. The U.S. Public Health Service Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises HIV-infected women not to breast-feed to avoid potential transmission of HIV to uninfected infants.



    Pediatric Use



  The efficacy and safety of SPORANOX  (r)  have not been established in pediatric patients.



 The long-term effects of itraconazole on bone growth in children are unknown. In three toxicology studies using rats, itraconazole induced bone defects at dosage levels as low as 20 mg/kg/day (2.5 times the MRHD). The induced defects included reduced bone plate activity, thinning of the zona compacta of the large bones, and increased bone fragility. At a dosage level of 80 mg/kg/day (10 times the MRHD) over 1 year or 160 mg/kg/day (20 times the MRHD) for 6 months, itraconazole induced small tooth pulp with hypocellular appearance in some rats.



    Geriatric Use



  Clinical studies of SPORANOX  (r)  Capsules did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. It is advised to use SPORANOX  (r)  Capsules in these patients only if it is determined that the potential benefit outweighs the potential risks. In general, it is recommended that the dose selection for an elderly patient should be taken into consideration, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.



 Transient or permanent hearing loss has been reported in elderly patients receiving treatment with itraconazole. Several of these reports included concurrent administration of quinidine which is contraindicated (See  BOXED WARNING: Drug Interactions  ,  CONTRAINDICATIONS: Drug Interactions  and  PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions  ).



    HIV-Infected Patients



  Because hypochlorhydria has been reported in HIV-infected individuals, the absorption of itraconazole in these patients may be decreased.



    Renal Impairment



  Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with renal impairment. The exposure of itraconazole may be lower in some patients with renal impairment. Caution should be exercised when itraconazole is administered in this patient population and dose adjustment may be needed. (See  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations  and  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  .)



    Hepatic Impairment



  Limited data are available on the use of oral itraconazole in patients with hepatic impairment. Caution should be exercised when this drug is administered in this patient population. It is recommended that patients with impaired hepatic function be carefully monitored when taking SPORANOX  (r)  . It is recommended that the prolonged elimination half-life of itraconazole observed in the single oral dose clinical trial with itraconazole capsules in cirrhotic patients be considered when deciding to initiate therapy with other medications metabolized by CYP3A4.



 In patients with elevated or abnormal liver enzymes or active liver disease, or who have experienced liver toxicity with other drugs, treatment with SPORANOX  (r)  is strongly discouraged unless there is a serious or life-threatening situation where the expected benefit exceeds the risk. It is recommended that liver function monitoring be done in patients with pre-existing hepatic function abnormalities or those who have experienced liver toxicity with other medications. (See  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations  and  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  .)
</Section>
    <Section id="S4" name="warnings">    WARNINGS



   Hepatic Effects



   SPORANOX  (r)  has been associated with rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death. Some of these cases had neither pre-existing liver disease nor a serious underlying medical condition, and some of these cases developed within the first week of treatment. If clinical signs or symptoms develop that are consistent with liver disease, treatment should be discontinued and liver function testing performed. Continued SPORANOX  (r)  use or reinstitution of treatment with SPORANOX  (r)  is strongly discouraged unless there is a serious or life-threatening situation where the expected benefit exceeds the risk. (See  PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients  and  ADVERSE REACTIONS  .)  



    Cardiac Dysrhythmias



  Life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias and/or sudden death have occurred in patients using drugs such as cisapride, pimozide, methadone, or quinidine concomitantly with SPORANOX  (r)  and/or other CYP3A4 inhibitors. Concomitant administration of these drugs with SPORANOX  (r)  is contraindicated. (See  BOXED WARNING  ,  CONTRAINDICATIONS  , and  PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions  .)



    Cardiac Disease



   SPORANOX  (r)  Capsules should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis in patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction such as congestive heart failure (CHF) or a history of CHF.  SPORANOX  (r)  Capsules should not be used for other indications in patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction unless the benefit clearly outweighs the risk.



 For patients with risk factors for congestive heart failure, physicians should carefully review the risks and benefits of SPORANOX  (r)  therapy. These risk factors include cardiac disease such as ischemic and valvular disease; significant pulmonary disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and renal failure and other edematous disorders. Such patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of CHF, should be treated with caution, and should be monitored for signs and symptoms of CHF during treatment. If signs or symptoms of CHF appear during administration of SPORANOX  (r)  Capsules, discontinue administration.



 Itraconazole has been shown to have a negative inotropic effect. When itraconazole was administered intravenously to anesthetized dogs, a dose-related negative inotropic effect was documented. In a healthy volunteer study of itraconazole intravenous infusion, transient, asymptomatic decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction were observed using gated SPECT imaging; these resolved before the next infusion, 12 hours later.



 SPORANOX  (r)  has been associated with reports of congestive heart failure. In post-marketing experience, heart failure was more frequently reported in patients receiving a total daily dose of 400 mg although there were also cases reported among those receiving lower total daily doses.



 Calcium channel blockers can have negative inotropic effects which may be additive to those of itraconazole. In addition, itraconazole can inhibit the metabolism of calcium channel blockers. Therefore, caution should be used when co-administering itraconazole and calcium channel blockers due to an increased risk of CHF. Concomitant administration of SPORANOX  (r)  and felodipine or nisoldipine is contraindicated.



 Cases of CHF, peripheral edema, and pulmonary edema have been reported in the post-marketing period among patients being treated for onychomycosis and/or systemic fungal infections. (See  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations  ,  CONTRAINDICATIONS  ,  PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions  , and  ADVERSE REACTIONS: Post-marketing Experience  for more information.)



    Interaction potential



  SPORANOX  (r)  has a potential for clinically important drug interactions. Coadministration of specific drugs with itraconazole may result in changes in efficacy of itraconazole and/or the coadministered drug, life-threatening effects and/or sudden death. Drugs that are contraindicated, not recommended or recommended for use with caution in combination with itraconazole are listed in PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions.



    Interchangeability



  SPORANOX  (r)  (itraconazole) Capsules and SPORANOX  (r)  Oral Solution should not be used interchangeably. This is because drug exposure is greater with the Oral Solution than with the Capsules when the same dose of drug is given. In addition, the topical effects of mucosal exposure may be different between the two formulations. Only the Oral Solution has been demonstrated effective for oral and/or esophageal candidiasis.
