    <Section id="S1" name="adverse reactions">    ADVERSE REACTIONS:

  CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION is generally well tolerated. The most common adverse reactions have been local reactions following intravenous injection. Other adverse reactions have been encountered infrequently.



     Local Reactions:  

  Thrombophlebitis has occurred with intravenous administration.



     Allergic Reactions:  

  Rash (including exfoliative dermatitis and toxic epidermal necrolysis), urticaria, flushing, pruritus, eosinophilia, fever, dyspnea, and other allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, interstitial nephritis and angioedema have been noted.



     Cardiovascular:  

  Hypotension.



     Gastrointestinal:  

  Diarrhea, including documented pseudomembranous colitis which can appear during or after antibiotic treatment. Nausea and vomiting have been reported rarely.



     Neuromuscular:  

  Possible exacerbation of myasthenia gravis



     Blood:  

  Eosinophilia, leukopenia including granulocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, including hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and bone marrow depression. A positive direct Coombs test may develop in some individuals, especially those with azotemia.



     Liver Function:  

  Transient elevations in SGOT, SGPT, serum LDH, and serum alkaline phosphatase; and jaundice have been reported.



     Renal Function:  

  Elevations in serum creatinine and/or blood urea nitrogen levels have been observed. As with the cephalosporins, acute renal failure has been reported rarely. The role of CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION in changes in renal function tests is difficult to assess, since factors predisposing to prerenal azotemia or to impaired renal function usually have been present.



 In addition to the adverse reactions listed above which have been observed in patients treated with CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION, the following adverse reactions and altered laboratory test results have been reported for cephalosporin class antibiotics:



 Urticaria, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, serum sickness-like reactions, abdominal pain, colitis, renal dysfunction, toxic nephropathy, false-positive test for urinary glucose, hepatic dysfunction including cholestasis, elevated bilirubin, aplastic anemia, hemorrhage, prolonged prothrombin time, pancytopenia, agranulocytosis, superinfection, vaginitis including vaginal candidiasis.



 Several cephalosporins have been implicated in triggering seizures, particularly in patients with renal impairment when the dosage was not reduced. (See      DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION    .  ) If seizures associated with drug therapy occur, the drug should be discontinued. Anticonvulsant therapy can be given if clinically indicated.

    <Section id="S2" name="precautions">    PRECAUTIONS:



   General:



   The total daily dose should be reduced when CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION is administered to patients with transient or persistent reduction of urinary output due to renal insufficiency (see   DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION    ), because high and prolonged serum antibiotic concentrations can occur in such individuals from usual doses.  
 

 Antibiotics (including cephalosporins) should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis.



  As with other antibiotics, prolonged use of CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Repeated evaluation of the patient's condition is essential. If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken.  
 

 Prescribing CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.



    Information for Patients:



   Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION or other antibacterial drugs in the future.  
 

 Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics, which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting the treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.



    Laboratory Tests:



  As with any potent antibacterial agent, periodic assessment of organ system functions, including renal, hepatic, and hematopoietic, is advisable during prolonged therapy.



    Drug Interactions:



  Increased nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of cephalosporins and aminoglycoside antibiotics.



    Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions:



   As with cephalothin, high concentrations of cefoxitin (&gt; 100 mcg/mL) may interfere with measurement of serum and urine creatinine levels by the Jaffe reaction, and produce false increases of modest degree in the levels of creatinine reported. Serum samples from patients treated with cefoxitin should not be analyzed for creatinine if withdrawn within 2 hours of drug administration.  
 

  High concentrations of cefoxitin in the urine may interfere with measurement of urinary 17-hydroxy-corticosteroids by the Porter-Silber reaction, and produce false increases of modest degree in the levels reported.  
 

 A false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine may occur. This has been observed with CLINITEST    reagent tablets.



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:



  Long-term studies in animals have not been performed with cefoxitin to evaluate carcinogenic or mutagenic potential. Studies in rats treated intravenously with 400 mg/kg of cefoxitin (approximately three times the maximum recommended human dose) revealed no effects on fertility or mating ability.



    Pregnancy:



   Reproduction studies performed in rats and mice at parenteral doses of approximately one to seven and one-half times the maximum recommended human dose did not reveal teratogenic or fetal toxic effects, although a slight decrease in fetal weight was observed.  
 

  There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.  
 

 In the rabbit, cefoxitin was associated with a high incidence of abortion and maternal death. This was not considered to be a teratogenic effect but an expected consequence of the rabbit's unusual sensitivity to antibiotic-induced changes in the population of the microflora of the intestine.



    Nursing Mothers:



  Cefoxitin is excreted in human milk in low concentrations. Caution should be exercised when CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION is administered to a nursing woman.



    Pediatric Use:



  Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients from birth to 3 months of age have not yet been established. In pediatric patients 3 months of age and older, higher doses of CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION have been associated with an increased incidence of eosinophilia and elevated SGOT.



    Geriatric Use:



   Of the 1,775 subjects who received cefoxitin in clinical studies, 424 (24%) were 65 and over, while 124 (7%) were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out (see   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY    ).  
 

 This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function (see    DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION    and   PRECAUTIONS    ).

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings">    WARNINGS:



   BEFORE THERAPY WITH CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION IS INSTITUTED, CAREFUL INQUIRY SHOULD BE MADE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE PATIENT HAS HAD PREVIOUS HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS TO CEFOXITIN, CEPHALOSPORINS, PENICILLINS, OR OTHER DRUGS. THIS PRODUCT SHOULD BE GIVEN WITH CAUTION TO PENICILLIN-SENSITIVE PATIENTS. ANTIBIOTICS SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED WITH CAUTION TO ANY PATIENT WHO HAS DEMONSTRATED SOME FORM OF ALLERGY, PARTICULARLY TO DRUGS. IF AN ALLERGIC REACTION TO CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION OCCURS, DISCONTINUE THE DRUG. SERIOUS HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS MAY REQUIRE EPINEPHRINE AND OTHER EMERGENCY MEASURES.  
 

   Clostridium difficile  associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including cefoxitin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile  .  
 

   C. difficile  produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile  cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.  
 

 If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile  may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile,  and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.
