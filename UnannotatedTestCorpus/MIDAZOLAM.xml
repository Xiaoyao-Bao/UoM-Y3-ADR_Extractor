  See         WARNINGS    concerning serious cardiorespiratory events and possible paradoxical reactions.     Fluctuations in vital signs were the most frequently seen findings following parenteral administration of midazolam in adults and included decreased tidal volume and/or respiratory rate decrease (23.3% of patients following IV and 10.8% of patients following IM administration) and apnea (15.4% of patients following IV administration), as well as variations in blood pressure and pulse rate.  The majority of serious adverse effects, particularly those associated with oxygenation and ventilation, have been reported when midazolam is administered with other medications capable of depressing the central nervous system.  The incidence of such events is higher in patients undergoing procedures involving the airway without the protective effect of an endotracheal tube (e.g., upper endoscopy and dental procedures).



     Adults  

  The following additional adverse reactions were reported after intramuscular administration:




 headache (1.3%)              Local effects at IM Injection site     
 pain (3.7%)                 
 induration (0.5%)           
 redness (0.5%)              
 muscle stiffness (0.3%)     
                                                         
 

 Administration of IM midazolam to elderly and/or higher risk surgical patients has been associated with rare reports of death under circumstances compatible with cardiorespiratory depression.  In most of these cases, the patients also received other central nervous system depressants capable of depressing respiration, especially narcotics (see  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  ).



 The following additional adverse reactions were reported subsequent to intravenous administration as a single sedative/anxiolytic/amnestic agent in adult patients:




 hiccoughs (3.9%)             Local effects at the IV site     
 nausea (2.8%)              tenderness (5.6%)           
 vomiting (2.6%)            pain during injection (5.0%)   
 coughing (1.3%)            redness (2.6%)              
 ''oversedation'' (1.6%)    induration (1.7%)           
 headache (1.5%)            phlebitis (0.4%)            
 drowsiness (1.2%)           
          Pediatric Patients  
   The following adverse events related to the use of IV midazolam in pediatric patients were reported in the medical literature: desaturation 4.6%, apnea 2.8%, hypotension 2.7%, paradoxical reactions 2.0%, hiccough 1.2%, seizure-like activity 1.1% and nystagmus 1.1%.  The majority of airway-related events occurred in patients receiving other CNS depressing medications and in patients where midazolam was not used as a single sedating agent.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING

  WARNING

      Personnel and Equipment for Monitoring and Resuscitation    



     Adults and Pediatrics:        Intravenous midazolam has been associated with respiratory depression and respiratory arrest, especially when used for sedation in noncritical care settings.  In some cases, where this was not recognized promptly and treated effectively, death or hypoxic encephalopathy has resulted.  Intravenous midazolam should be used only in hospital or ambulatory care settings, including physicians' and dental offices, that provide for continuous monitoring of respiratory and cardiac function, e.g., pulse oximetry.  Immediate availability of resuscitative drugs and age- and size-appropriate equipment for bag/valve/mask ventilation and intubation, and personnel trained in their use and skilled in airway management should be assured (see     WARNINGS    ).  For deeply sedated pediatric patients, a dedicated individual, other than the practitioner performing the procedure, should monitor the patient throughout the procedure.  



     Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids    



   Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death.  Monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation (see     WARNINGS    ,     PRECAUTIONS    ,     Drug Interactions    ).  



     Individualization of Dosage    



   Midazolam must never be used without individualization of dosage.  The initial intravenous dose for sedation in adult patients may be as little as 1 mg, but should not exceed 2.5 mg in a normal healthy adult.  Lower doses are necessary for older (over 60 years) or debilitated patients and in patients receiving concomitant narcotics or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants.  The initial dose and all subsequent doses should always be titrated slowly; administer over at least 2 minutes and allow an additional 2 or more minutes to fully evaluate the sedative effect.  The dilution of the 5 mg/mL formulation is recommended to facilitate slower injection.  Doses of sedative medications in pediatric patients must be calculated on a mg/kg basis, and initial doses and all subsequent doses should always be titrated slowly.  The initial pediatric dose of midazolam for sedation/anxiolysis/amnesia is age, procedure, and route dependent (see     DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION     for complete dosing information).    



     Neonates:       Midazolam should not be administered by rapid injection in the neonatal population.  Severe hypotension and seizures have been reported following rapid IV administration, particularly with concomitant use of fentanyl (see     DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION     for complete information).  
</Section>
    <Section id="S3" name="precautions">    PRECAUTIONS:



    General  



  Intravenous doses of midazolam should be decreased for elderly and for debilitated patients (see    WARNINGS     and  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  ).  These patients will also probably take longer to recover completely after midazolam administration for the induction of anesthesia.



 Midazolam does not protect against the increase in intracranial pressure or against the heart rate rise and/or blood pressure rise associated with endotracheal intubation under light general anesthesia.



   The efficacy and safety of midazolam in clinical use are functions of the dose administered, the clinical status of the individual patient, and the use of concomitant medications capable of depressing the CNS.  Anticipated effects range from mild sedation to deep levels of sedation virtually equivalent to a state of general anesthesia where the patient may require external support of vital functions.  Care must be taken to individualize and carefully titrate the dose of midazolam to the patient's underlying medical/surgical conditions, administer to the desired effect being certain to wait an adequate time for peak CNS effects of both midazolam and concomitant medications, and have the personnel and size-appropriate equipment and facilities available for monitoring and intervention (see   BOXED WARNING  ,   WARNINGS     and  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  ).  Practitioners administering midazolam must have the skills necessary to manage reasonably foreseeable adverse effects, particularly skills in airway management.  For information regarding withdrawal (see   DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE  )  .



     Information for Patients  



  To assure safe and effective use of benzodiazepines, the following information and instructions should be communicated to the patient when appropriate:



 *  Inform your physician about any alcohol consumption and medicine you are now taking, especially blood pressure medication and antibiotics, including drugs you buy without a prescription.  Alcohol has an increased effect when consumed with benzodiazepines; therefore, caution should be exercised regarding simultaneous ingestion of alcohol during benzodiazepine treatment. 
 *  Inform your physician if you are pregnant or are planning to become pregnant. 
 *  Inform your physician if you are nursing. 
 *  Patients should be informed of the pharmacological effects of midazolam, such as sedation and amnesia, which in some patients may be profound.  The decision as to when patients who have received injectable midazolam, particularly on an outpatient basis, may again engage in activities requiring complete mental alertness, operate hazardous machinery or drive a motor vehicle must be individualized. 
 *  Patients receiving continuous infusion of midazolam in critical care settings over an extended period of time, may experience symptoms of withdrawal following abrupt discontinuation. 
 *  Effect of anesthetic and sedation drugs on early brain developmentStudies conducted in young animals and children suggest repeated or prolonged use of general anesthetic or sedation drugs in children younger than 3 years may have negative effects on their developing brains. Discuss with parents and caregivers the benefits, risks, and timing and duration of surgery or procedures requiring anesthetic and sedation drugs. 
        Drug Interactions  
 

   Effect of Concomitant Use of Benzodiazepines and Opioids  



 The concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids increases the risk of respiratory depression because of actions at different receptor sites in the CNS that control respiration.  Benzodiazepines interact at GABAAsites and opioids interact primarily at mu receptors.  When benzodiazepines and opioids are combined, the potential for benzodiazepines to significantly worsen opioid-related respiratory depression exists.  Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation.



   Other CNS Depressants  
 

 The sedative effect of intravenous midazolam is accentuated by any concomitantly administered medication, which depresses the central nervous system, particularly opioids (e.g., morphine, meperidine and fentanyl) and also secobarbital and droperidol.  Consequently, the dosage of midazolam should be adjusted according to the type and amount of concomitant medications administered and the desired clinical response (see    DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION      ).



     Other Drug Interactions  
 

 Caution is advised when midazolam is administered concomitantly with drugs that are known to inhibit the P450-3A4 enzyme system such as cimetidine (not ranitidine), erythromycin, diltiazem, verapamil, ketoconazole and itraconazole.  These drug interactions may result in prolonged sedation due to a decrease in plasma clearance of midazolam.



  The effect of single oral doses of 800 mg cimetidine and 300 mg ranitidine on steady-state concentrations of oral midazolam was examined in a randomized crossover study (n=8).  Cimetidine increased the mean midazolam steady-state concentration from 57 to 71 ng/mL.  Ranitidine increased the mean steady-state concentration to 62 ng/mL.  No change in choice reaction time or sedation index was detected after dosing with the H2 receptor antagonists.
 

    In a placebo-controlled study, erythromycin administered as a 500 mg dose, three times a day, for 1 week (n=6), reduced the clearance of midazolam following a single 0.5 mg/kg IV dose.  The half-life was approximately doubled.
 

  Caution is advised when midazolam is administered to patients receiving erythromycin since this may result in a decrease in the plasma clearance of midazolam.
 

  The effects of diltiazem (60 mg three times a day) and verapamil (80 mg three times a day) on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral midazolam were investigated in a three-way crossover study (n=9).  The half-life of midazolam increased from 5 to 7 hours when midazolam was taken in conjunction with verapamil or diltiazem.  No interaction was observed in healthy subjects between midazolam and nifedipine.
 

  In a placebo-controlled study where saquinavir or placebo was administered orally as a 1,200 mg dose, three times a day, for 5 days (n=12), a 56% reduction in the clearance of midazolam following a single 0.05 mg/kg IV dose was observed. The half-life was approximately doubled.
 

  A moderate reduction in induction dosage requirements of thiopental (about 15%) has been noted following use of intramuscular midazolam for premedication in adults.
 

  The intravenous administration of midazolam decreases the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of halothane required for general anesthesia.  This decrease correlates with the dose of midazolam administered; no similar studies have been carried out in pediatric patients but there is no scientific reason to expect that pediatric patients would respond differently than adults.
 

  Although the possibility of minor interactive effects has not been fully studied, midazolam and pancuronium have been used together in patients without noting clinically significant changes in dosage, onset or duration in adults.  Midazolam does not protect against the characteristic circulatory changes noted after administration of succinylcholine or pancuronium and does not protect against the increased intracranial pressure noted following administration of succinylcholine.  Midazolam does not cause a clinically significant change in dosage, onset or duration of a single intubating dose of succinylcholine; no similar studies have been carried out in pediatric patients but there is no scientific reason to expect that pediatric patients would respond differently than adults.
 

     Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions  



  Midazolam has not been shown to interfere with results obtained in clinical laboratory tests.



     Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  



    Carcinogenesis:  Midazolam maleate was administered with diet in mice and rats for 2 years at dosages of 1, 9 and 80 mg/kg/day. In female mice in the highest dose group there was a marked increase in the incidence of hepatic tumors. In high-dose male rats there was a small but statistically significant increase in benign thyroid follicular cell tumors. Dosages of 9 mg/kg/day of midazolam maleate (4 times a human induction dose of 0.35 mg/kg based on body surface area comparison) do not increase the incidence of tumors. The pathogenesis of induction of these tumors is not known. These tumors were found after chronic administration, whereas human use will ordinarily be of single or several doses.   Mutagenesis:  Midazolam did not have mutagenic activity in Salmonella typhimurium  (5 bacterial strains), Chinese hamster lung cells (V79), human lymphocytes or in the micronucleus test in mice. Impairment of Fertility:  Male rats were treated orally with 1, 4, or 16 mg/kg midazolam beginning 62 days prior to mating with female rats treated with the same doses for 14 days prior to mating to Gestation Day 13 or Lactation Day 21. The high dose produced an equivalent exposure (AUC) as 4 mg/kg intravenous midazolam (1.85 times the human induction dose of 0.35 mg/kg based on body surface area comparison). There were no adverse effects on either male or female fertility noted.
 

     Pregnancy  



     Teratogenic Effects      Pregnancy Category D (see   WARNINGS    ).
 

  Published studies in pregnant primates demonstrate that the administration of anesthetic and sedation drugs that block NMDA receptors and/or potentiate GABA activity during the period of peak brain development increases neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain of the offspring when used for longer than 3 hours. There are no data on pregnancy exposures in primates corresponding to periods prior to the third trimester in humans ( see Data  ).
 

  Data  



  Animal Data  



 Pregnant rats were treated with midazolam using intravenous doses of 0.2, 1, and 4 mg/kg/day (0.09, 0.46, and 1.85 times the human induction dose of 0.35 mg/kg based on body surface area comparisons) during the period of organogenesis (Gestation Day 7 through 15).  Midazolam did not cause adverse effects to the fetus at doses of up to 1.85 times the human induction dose.  All doses produced slight to moderate ataxia.  The high dose produced a 5% decrease in maternal body weight gain compared to control.   



 Pregnant rabbits were treated with midazolam using intravenous doses of 0.2, 0.6, and 2 mg/kg/day (0.09, 0.46, and 1.85 times the human induction dose of 0.35 mg/kg based on body surface area comparisons) during the period of organogenesis (Gestation Day 7 to 18).  Midazolam did not cause adverse effects to the fetus at doses of up to 1.85 times the human induction dose.  The high dose was associated with findings of ataxia and sedation but no evidence of maternal toxicity.  



 Pregnant rats were administered midazolam using intravenous doses of 0.2, 1, and 4 mg/kg/day (0.09, 0.46, and 1.85 times the human induction dose of 0.35 mg/kg based on body surface area comparisons) during late gestation and through lactation (Gestation Day 15 through Lactation Day 21).  All doses produced ataxia.  The high dose produced a slight decrease in maternal body weight gain compared to control.  There were no clear adverse effects noted in the offspring.  The study included no functional assessments of the pups, such as learning and memory testing or reproductive capacity.



 In a published study in primates, administration of an anesthetic dose of ketamine for 24 hours on Gestation Day 122 increased neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain of the fetus. In other published studies, administration of either isoflurane or propofol for 5 hours on Gestation Day 120 resulted in increased neuronal and oligodendrocyte apoptosis in the developing brain of the offspring. With respect to brain development, this time period corresponds to the third trimester of gestation in the human. The clinical significance of these findings is not clear; however, studies in juvenile animals suggest neuroapoptosis correlates with long-term cognitive deficits (see   WARNINGS    ,   Pediatric Neurotoxicity    ,   PRECAUTIONS    ,   Pediatric Use    , and   Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology    ).



     Labor and Delivery  



  In humans, measurable levels of midazolam were found in maternal venous serum, umbilical venous and arterial serum and amniotic fluid, indicating placental transfer of the drug.  Following intramuscular administration of 0.05 mg/kg of midazolam, both the venous and the umbilical arterial serum concentrations were lower than maternal concentrations.



 The use of injectable midazolam in obstetrics has not been evaluated in clinical studies.  Because midazolam is transferred transplacentally and because other benzodiazepines given in the last weeks of pregnancy have resulted in neonatal CNS depression, midazolam is not recommended for obstetrical use.



     Nursing Mothers  



  Midazolam is excreted in human milk.  Caution should be exercised when midazolam is administered to a nursing woman.



     Pediatric Use  



  The safety and efficacy of midazolam for sedation/anxiolysis/amnesia following single dose intramuscular administration, intravenously by intermittent injections and continuous infusion have been established in pediatric and neonatal patients.  For specific safety monitoring and dosage guidelines see     BOXED WARNING      ,    CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY      ,    INDICATIONS AND USAGE      ,     WARNINGS ,           PRECAUTIONS      ,     ADVERSE REACTIONS ,           OVERDOSAGE         and    DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION      .  UNLIKE ADULT PATIENTS, PEDIATRIC PATIENTS GENERALLY RECEIVE INCREMENTS OF MIDAZOLAM ON A MG/KG BASIS.  As a group, pediatric patients generally require higher dosages of midazolam (mg/kg) than do adults.  Younger (less than six years) pediatric patients may require higher dosages (mg/kg) than older pediatric patients, and may require closer monitoring.  In obese PEDIATRIC PATIENTS, the dose should be calculated based on ideal body weight.  When midazolam is given in conjunction with opioids or other sedatives, the potential for respiratory depression, airway obstruction, or hypoventilation is increased.  The healthcare practitioner who uses this medication in pediatric patients should be aware of and follow accepted professional guidelines for pediatric sedation appropriate to their situation.



 Midazolam should not be administered by rapid injection in the neonatal population.  Severe hypotension and seizures have been reported following rapid IV administration, particularly with concomitant use of fentanyl.



 Midazolam contain benzyl alcohol as a preservative.  Benzyl alcohol, a component of this product, has been associated with serious adverse events and death, particularly in pediatric patients.  The "gasping syndrome", (characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, gasping respirations, and high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites found in the blood and urine) has been associated with benzyl alcohol dosages greater than 99 mg/kg/day in neonates and low-birth-weight neonates.  Additional symptoms may include gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse.  Although normal therapeutic doses of this product deliver amounts of benzyl alcohol that are substantially lower than those reported in association with the "gasping syndrome", the minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known.  Premature and low-birth-weight infants, as well as patients receiving high dosages, may be more likely to develop toxicity.  Practitioners administering this and other medications containing benzyl alcohol should consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources.



  Animal Data  



 Published juvenile animal studies demonstrate that the administration of anesthetic and sedation drugs, such as Midazolam Injection USP, that either block NMDA receptors or potentiate the activity of GABA during the period of rapid brain growth or synaptogenesis, results in widespread neuronal and oligodendrocyte cell loss in the developing brain and alterations in synaptic morphology and neurogenesis. Based on comparisons across species, the window of vulnerability to these changes is believed to correlate with exposures in the third trimester of gestation through the first several months of life, but may extend out to approximately 3 years of age in humans.



 In primates, exposure to 3 hours of ketamine that produced a light surgical plane of anesthesia did not increase neuronal cell loss, however, treatment regimens of 5 hours or longer of isoflurane increased neuronal cell loss. Data from isoflurane-treated rodents and ketamine-treated primates suggest that the neuronal and oligodendrocyte cell losses  are associated with prolonged cognitive deficits in learning and memory. The clinical significance of these nonclinical findings is not known, and healthcare providers should balance the benefits of appropriate anesthesia in pregnant women, neonates, and young children who require procedures with the potential risks suggested by the nonclinical data (see    WARNINGS      ,    Pediatric Neurotoxicity      ,    PRECAUTIONS      ,    Pregnancy      , and    Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology      ).



 No significant adverse interactions with commonly used premedications or drugs used during anesthesia and surgery (including atropine, scopolamine, glycopyrrolate, diazepam, hydroxyzine, d-tubocurarine, succinylcholine and other nondepolarizing muscle relaxants) or topical local anesthetics (including lidocaine, dyclonine HCl and Cetacaine) have been observed in adults or pediatric patients.  In neonates, however, severe hypotension has been reported with concomitant administration of fentanyl.  This effect has been observed in neonates on an infusion of midazolam who received a rapid injection of fentanyl and in patients on an infusion of fentanyl who have received a rapid injection of midazolam.  



      Geriatric Use  
 

  Because geriatric patients may have altered drug distribution and diminished hepatic and/or renal function, reduced doses of midazolam are recommended.  Intravenous and intramuscular doses of midazolam should be decreased for elderly and for debilitated patients (see    WARNINGS     and  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  ) and subjects over 70 years of age may be particularly sensitive.  These patients will also probably take longer to recover completely after midazolam administration for the induction of anesthesia.  Administration of IM and IV midazolam to elderly and/or high risk surgical patients has been associated with rare reports of death under circumstances compatible with cardiorespiratory depression.  In most of these cases, the patients also received other central nervous system depressants capable of depressing respiration, especially narcotics (see  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  ).



 Specific dosing and monitoring guidelines for geriatric patients are provided in the    DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION     section for premedicated patients for sedation/anxiolysis/amnesia following IV and IM administration, for induction of anesthesia following IV administration and for continuous infusion.
</Section>
    <Section id="S4" name="warnings">    WARNINGS:



   Personnel and Equipment for Monitoring and Resuscitation  



 Prior to the intravenous administration of midazolam in any dose, the immediate availability of oxygen, resuscitative drugs, age- and size-appropriate equipment for bag/valve/mask ventilation and intubation, and skilled personnel for the maintenance of a patent airway and support of ventilation should be ensured.  Patients should be continuously monitored for early signs of hypoventilation, airway obstruction, or apnea with means readily available (e.g., pulse oximetry).  Hypoventilation, airway obstruction, and apnea can lead to hypoxia and/or cardiac arrest unless effective countermeasures are taken immediately.  The immediate availability of specific reversal agents (flumazenil) is highly recommended.  Vital signs should continue to be monitored during the recovery period. Because intravenous midazolam can depress respiration (see    CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY      ), especially when used concomitantly with opioid agonists and other sedatives (see    DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION      ), it should be used for sedation/anxiolysis/amnesia only in the presence of personnel skilled in early detection of hypoventilation, maintaining a patent airway, and supporting ventilation.  When used for sedation/anxiolysis/amnesia, midazolam should always be titrated slowly in adult or pediatric patients. Adverse hemodynamic events have been reported in pediatric patients with cardiovascular instability; rapid intravenous administration should also be avoided in this population (see     DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION      for complete information).



  Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids  



 Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including midazolam, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death.  If a decision is made to use midazolam concomitantly with opioids, monitor patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation (see    PRECAUTIONS      ,    Drug Interactions      ).



  Risk of Respiratory Adverse Events  



 Serious cardiorespiratory adverse events have occurred after administration of midazolam.  These have included respiratory depression, airway obstruction, oxygen desaturation, apnea, respiratory arrest and/or cardiac arrest, sometimes resulting in death or permanent neurologic injury.  There have also been rare reports of hypotensive episodes requiring treatment during or after diagnostic or surgical manipulations particularly in adult or pediatric patients with hemodynamic instability.  Hypotension occurred more frequently in the sedation studies in patients premedicated with a narcotic.



  Individualization of Dosage  



 Midazolam must never be used without individualization of dosage particularly when used with other medications capable of producing central nervous system depression.    



 See     DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION       for complete information.



  Other Adverse Events  



 Reactions such as agitation, involuntary movements (including tonic/clonic movements and muscle tremor), hyperactivity and combativeness have been reported in both adult and pediatric patients.  These reactions may be due to inadequate or excessive dosing or improper administration of midazolam; however, consideration should be given to the possibility of cerebral hypoxia or true paradoxical reactions.  Should such reactions occur, the response to each dose of midazolam and all other drugs, including local anesthetics, should be evaluated before proceeding.  Reversal of such responses with flumazenil has been reported in pediatric patients.



  Concomitant Use of Central Nervous System Depressants  



 Concomitant use of barbiturates, alcohol or other central nervous system depressants may increase the risk of hypoventilation, airway obstruction, desaturation, or apnea and may contribute to profound and/or prolonged drug effect.  Narcotic premedication also depresses the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide stimulation.



  Debilitation and Comorbid Considerations  



 Higher risk adult and pediatric surgical patients, elderly patients and debilitated adult and pediatric patients require lower dosages, whether or not concomitant sedating medications have been administered.  Adult or pediatric patients with COPD are unusually sensitive to the respiratory depressant effect of midazolam.  Pediatric and adult patients undergoing procedures involving the upper airway such as upper endoscopy or dental care, are particularly vulnerable to episodes of desaturation and hypoventilation due to partial airway obstruction.  Adult and pediatric patients with chronic renal failure and patients with congestive heart failure eliminate midazolam more slowly (see    CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY      ).  Because elderly patients frequently have inefficient function of one or more organ systems and because dosage requirements have been shown to decrease with age, reduced initial dosage of midazolam is recommended, and the possibility of profound and/or prolonged effect should be considered.



 Injectable midazolam should not be administered to adult or pediatric patients in shock or coma, or in acute alcohol intoxication with depression of vital signs.  Particular care should be exercised in the use of intravenous midazolam in adult or pediatric patients with uncompensated acute illnesses, such as severe fluid or electrolyte disturbances.



  Risk of Intra-arterial Injection  



 There have been limited reports of intra-arterial injection of midazolam.  Adverse events have included local reactions, as well as isolated reports of seizure activity in which no clear causal relationship was established.  Precautions against unintended intra-arterial injection should be taken.  Extravasation should also be avoided.



 The safety and efficacy of midazolam following nonintravenous and nonintramuscular routes of administration have not been established.  Midazolam should only be administered intramuscularly or intravenously.



  Return to Full Cognitive Function  



 Midazolam is associated with a high incidence of partial or complete impairment of recall for the next several hours.  The decision as to when patients who have received injectable midazolam, particularly on an outpatient basis, may again engage in activities requiring complete mental alertness, operate hazardous machinery or drive a motor vehicle must be individualized.  Gross tests of recovery from the effects of midazolam (see    CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY      ) cannot be relied upon to predict reaction time under stress.  It is recommended that no patient operate hazardous machinery or a motor vehicle until the effects of the drug, such as drowsiness, have subsided or until one full day after anesthesia and surgery, whichever is longer.  For pediatric patients, particular care should be taken to assure safe ambulation.



     Usage in Pregnancy  



  An increased risk of congenital malformations associated with the use of benzodiazepine drugs (diazepam and chlordiazepoxide) has been suggested in several studies.  If this drug is used during pregnancy, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.



 Withdrawal symptoms of the barbiturate type have occurred after the discontinuation of benzodiazepines (see    DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE    ).



     Usage in Preterm Infants and Neonates  



  Rapid injection should be avoided in the neonatal population.  Midazolam administered rapidly as an intravenous injection (less than 2 minutes) has been associated with severe hypotension in neonates, particularly when the patient has also received fentanyl.  Likewise, severe hypotension has been observed in neonates receiving a continuous infusion of midazolam who then receive a rapid intravenous injection of fentanyl.  Seizures have been reported in several neonates following rapid intravenous administration.



 The neonate also has reduced and/or immature organ function and is also vulnerable to profound and/or prolonged respiratory effects of midazolam.



 Exposure to excessive amounts of benzyl alcohol has been associated with toxicity (hypotension, metabolic acidosis), particularly in neonates, and an increased incidence of kernicterus, particularly in small preterm infants.  There have been rare reports of deaths, primarily in preterm infants, associated with exposure to excessive amounts of benzyl alcohol.  The amount of benzyl alcohol from medications is usually considered negligible compared to that received in flush solutions containing benzyl alcohol.  Administration of high dosages of medications (including midazolam) containing this preservative must take into account the total amount of benzyl alcohol administered.  The recommended dosage range of midazolam for preterm and term infants includes amounts of benzyl alcohol well below that associated with toxicity; however, the amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known.  If the patient requires more than the recommended dosages or other medications containing this preservative, the practitioner must consider the daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from these combined sources (see     WARNINGS      and    PRECAUTIONS      ,     Pediatric Use        ).



     Pediatric Neurotoxicity  



  Published animal studies demonstrate that the administration of anesthetic and sedation drugs that block NMDA receptors and/or potentiate GABA activity increase neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain and result in long-term cognitive deficits when used for longer than 3 hours. The clinical significance of these findings is not clear. However, based on the available data, the window of vulnerability to these changes is believed to correlate with exposures in the third trimester of gestation through the first several months of life, but may extend out to approximately three years of age in humans (see   PRECAUTIONS  ,     Pregnancy  and   Pediatric Use  and  Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology  ).



 Some published studies in children suggest that similar deficits may occur after repeated or prolonged exposures to anesthetic agents early in life and may result in adverse cognitive or behavioral effects. These studies have substantial limitations, and it is not clear if the observed effects are due to the anesthetic/sedation drug administration or other factors such as the surgery or underlying illness.



 Anesthetic and sedation drugs are a necessary part of the care of children needing surgery, other procedures, or tests that cannot be delayed, and no specific medications have been shown to be safer than any other. Decisions regarding the timing of any elective procedures requiring anesthesia should take into consideration the benefits of the procedure weighed against the potential risks.
