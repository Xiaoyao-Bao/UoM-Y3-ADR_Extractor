    <Section id="S1" name="adverse reactions">    ADVERSE REACTIONS

  A single case (approximately one percent of patients studied) of acneiform eruption occurred with use of combined nystatin and triamcinolone acetonide in clinical studies.



 Nystatin is virtually nontoxic and nonsensitizing and is well tolerated by all age groups, even during prolonged use. Rarely, irritation may occur.



 The following local adverse reactions are reported infrequently with topical corticosteroids (reactions are listed in an approximate decreasing order of occurrence): burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, hypertrichosis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, maceration of the skin, perioral secondary infection, skin atrophy, striae and miliaria.

   General



  Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has produced reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria in some patients. Conditions that augment systemic absorption include application of the more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, prolonged use, and the addition of occlusive dressings (see   DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION    ).



 Therefore, patients receiving a large dose of any potent topical steroid applied to a large surface area should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression by using the urinary free cortisol and ACTH stimulation tests, and for impairment of internal homeostasis. If HPA axis suppression or elevation of the body temperature occurs, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or substitute a less potent steroid.



 Recovery of HPA axis function and thermal homeostasis are generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of the drug. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of steroid withdrawal may occur, requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids.



 Children may absorb proportionally larger amounts of topical corticosteroids and thus be more susceptible to systemic toxicity (see   PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use    ).



 If irritation or hypersensitivity develops with the combination nystatin and triamcinolone acetonide, treatment should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.



    Information for the Patient



  Patients using this medication should receive the following information and instructions:



 *  This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is for external use only. Avoid contact with the eyes. 
 *  Patients should be advised not to use this medication for any disorder other than for which it was prescribed. 
 *  The treated skin area should not be bandaged or otherwise covered or wrapped as to be occluded (see   DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION   ). 
 *  Patients should report any signs of local adverse reactions. 
 *  When using this medication in the inguinal area, patients should be advised to apply the cream sparingly and to wear loose fitting clothing. 
 *  Parents of pediatric patients should be advised not to use tight-fitting diapers or plastic pants on a child being treated in the diaper area, as these garments may constitute occlusive dressings. 
 *  Patients should be advised on preventive measures to avoid reinfection. 
       Laboratory Tests
 

  If there is a lack of therapeutic response, appropriate microbiological studies (e.g. KOH smears and/or cultures) should be repeated to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other pathogens, before instituting another course of therapy.



 A urinary free cortisol test and ACTH stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression due to corticosteroids.



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility



  Long-term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic or mutagenic potential, or possible impairment of fertility in males or females.



    Pregnancy Category C



  There are no teratogenic studies with combined nystatin and triamcinolone acetonide. Corticosteroids are generally teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. The more potent corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals. Therefore, any topical corticosteroid preparation should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.



 Topical preparations containing corticosteroids should not be used extensively on pregnant patients, in large amounts, or for prolonged periods of time.



    Nursing Mothers



  It is not known whether any component of this preparation is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised during the use of this preparation by a nursing woman.



    Pediatric Use



  In clinical studies of a limited number of pediatric patients ranging from two months through 12 years, nystatin and triamcinolone acetonide cream formulation cleared or significantly ameliorated the disease state in most patients.



  Pediatric patients may demonstrate greater susceptibility to topical corticosteroid-induced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression and Cushing's syndrome than mature patients because of a larger skin surface area to body weight ratio.  



 HPA axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, low plasma cortisol levels, and absence of response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema.



 Administration of topical corticosteroids to children should be limited to the least amount compatible with an effective therapeutic regimen. Chronic corticosteroid therapy may interfere with the growth and development of children.
