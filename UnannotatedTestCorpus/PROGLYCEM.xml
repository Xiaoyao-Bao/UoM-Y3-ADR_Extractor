    <Section id="S1" name="adverse reactions">    ADVERSE REACTIONS:

    Frequent and Serious:  

  Sodium and fluid retention is most common in young infants and in adults and may precipitate congestive heart failure in patients with compromised cardiac reserve. It usually responds to diuretic therapy (See  DRUG INTERACTIONS  ).



     Infrequent but Serious:  

  Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar nonketotic coma may develop very rapidly. Conventional therapy with insulin and restoration of fluid and electrolyte balance is usually effective if instituted promptly. Prolonged surveillance is essential in view of the long half-life of PROGLYCEM  (r)  (See  OVERDOSAGE  ).



     Other frequent adverse reactions:  

  Hirsutism of the lanugo type, mainly on the forehead, back and limbs, occurs most commonly in children and women and may be cosmetically unacceptable. It subsides on discontinuation of the drug.



 Hyperglycemia or glycosuria may require reduction in dosage in order to avoid progression to ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma.



 Gastrointestinal intolerance may include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, ileus, diarrhea, transient loss of taste.



 Tachycardia, palpitations, increased levels of serum uric acid are common.



 Thrombocytopenia with or without purpura may require discontinuation of the drug. Neutropenia is transient, is not associated with increased susceptibility to infection, and ordinarily does not require discontinuation of the drug. Skin rash, headache, weakness, and malaise may also occur.



     Other adverse reactions which have been observed are:  

    Cardiovascular:  hypotension occurs occasionally, which may be augmented by thiazide diuretics given concurrently. A few cases of transient hypertension, for which no explanation is apparent, have been noted. Chest pain has been reported rarely. Pulmonary hypertension has been reported in neonates and young infants (see  WARNINGS  ).



   Hematologic:  eosinophilia; decreased hemoglobin / hematocrit; excessive bleeding, decreased IgG.



   Hepato-renal:  increased AST, alkaline phosphatase; azotemia, decreased creatinine clearance, reversible nephrotic syndrome, decreased urinary output, hematuria, albuminuria. Neurologic: anxiety, dizziness, insomnia, polyneuritis, paresthesia, pruritus, extrapyramidal signs.



   Ophthalmologic:  transient cataracts, subconjunctival hemorrhage, ring scotoma, blurred vision, diplopia, lacrimation.  Skeletal, integumentary;  monilial dermatitis, herpes, advance in bone age; loss of scalp hair.  Systemic:  fever, lymphadenopathy.  Other;  gout acute pancreatitis/pancreatic necrosis, galactorrhea, enlargement of lump in breast.

   General:



  Treatment with PROGLYCEM  (r)  should be initiated under close clinical supervision, with careful monitoring of blood glucose and clinical response until the patient's condition has stabilized. This usually requires several days. If not effective in two to three weeks, the drug should be discontinued.



 Prolonged treatment requires regular monitoring of the urine for sugar and ketones, especially under stress conditions, with prompt reporting of any abnormalities to the physician. Additionally, blood sugar levels should be monitored periodically by the physician to determine the need for dose adjustment.



 The effects of diazoxide on the hematopoietic system and the level of serum uric acid should be kept in mind; the latter should be considered particularly in patients with hyperuricemia or a history of gout.



 In some patients, higher blood levels have been observed with the oral suspension than with the capsule formulation of PROGLYCEM  (r)  . Dosage should be adjusted as necessary in individual patients if changed from one formulation to the other.



 Since the plasma half-life of diazoxide is prolonged in patients with impaired renal function, a reduced dosage should be considered. Serum electrolyte levels should also be evaluated for such patients.



 The antihypertensive effect of other drugs may be enhanced by PROGLYCEM  (r)  , and this should be kept in mind when administering it concomitantly with antihypertensive agents.



 Because of the protein binding, administration of PROGLYCEM  (r)  with coumarin or its derivatives may require reduction in the dosage of the anticoagulant, although there has been no reported evidence of excessive anticoagulant effect. In addition, PROGLYCEM  (r)  may possibly displace bilirubin from albumin; this should be kept in mind particularly when treating newborns with increased bilirubinemia.



 Pulmonary hypertension has been reported in neonates and young infants treated with diazoxide. (see  WARNINGS  )



    Information for Patients:



  During treatment with PROGLYCEM  (r)  the patient should be advised to consult regularly with the physician and to cooperate in the periodic monitoring of his condition by laboratory tests. In addition, the patient should be advised:



 *  to take the drug on a regular schedule as prescribed, not to skip doses, not to take extra doses; 
 *  not to use this drug with other medications unless this is done with the physician's advice; 
 *  not to allow anyone else to take this medication; 
 *  to follow dietary instructions; 
 *  to report promptly any adverse effects (i.e., increased urinary frequency, increased thirst, fruity breath odor); 
 *  to report pregnancy or to discuss plans for pregnancy. 
       Laboratory tests:
 

  The following procedures may be especially important in patient monitoring (not necessarily inclusive); blood glucose determinations (recommended at periodic intervals in patients taking diazoxide orally for treatment of hypoglycemia, until stabilized); blood urea nitrogen (BUN) determinations and creatinine clearance determinations; hematocrit determinations; platelet count determinations; total and differential leukocyte counts; serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level determinations; serum uric acid level determinations; and urine testing for glucose and ketones (in patients being treated with diazoxide for hypoglycemia, semiquantitative estimation of sugar and ketones in serum performed by the patient and reported to the physician provides frequent and relatively inexpensive monitoring of the condition).



    Drug Interactions:



  Since diazoxide is highly bound to serum proteins, it may displace other substances which are also bound to protein, such as bilirubin or coumarin and its derivatives, resulting in higher blood levels of these substances. Concomitant administration of oral diazoxide and diphenylhydantoin may result in a loss of seizure control. These potential interactions must be considered when administering PROGLYCEM  (r)   Capsules or Suspension.



 The concomitant administration of thiazides or other commonly used diuretics may potentiate the hyperglycemic and hyperuricemic effects of diazoxide.



    Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions:



  The hyperglycemic and hyperuricemic effects of diazoxide preclude proper assessment of these metabolic states. Increased renin secretion, IgG concentrations and decreased cortisol secretions have also been noted. Diazoxide inhibits glucagon-stimulated insulin release and causes a false-negative insulin response to glucagon.



    Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility:



  No long-term animal dosing study has been done to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of diazoxide. No laboratory study of mutagenic potential or animal study of effects on fertility has been done.



 Reproduction studies using the oral preparation in rats have revealed increased fetal resorptions and delayed parturition, as well as fetal skeletal anomalies; evidence of skeletal and cardiac teratogenic effects in rabbits has been noted with intravenous administration. The drug has also been demonstrated to cross the placental barrier in animals and to cause degeneration of the fetal pancreatic beta cells (See   ANIMAL PHARMACOLOGY AND/OR TOXICOLOGY  ). Since there are no adequate data on fetal effects of this drug when given to pregnant women, safety in pregnancy has not been established. When the use of PROGLYCEM  (r)   is considered, the indications should be limited to those specified above for adults (See   INDICATIONS AND USAGE  ), and the potential benefits to the mother must be weighed against possible harmful effects to the fetus.



    Non-teratogenic effects:



  Diazoxide crosses the placental barrier and appears in cord blood. When given to the mother prior to delivery of the infant, the drug may produce fetal or neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, thrombocytopenia, altered carbohydrate metabolism, and possibly other side effects that have occurred in adults.



 Alopecia and hypertrichosis lanuginosa have occurred in infants whose mothers received oral diazoxide during the last 19 to 60 days of pregnancy.



    Labor and delivery:



  Since intravenous administration of the drug during labor may cause cessation of uterine contractions, and administration of oxytocic agents may be required to reinstate labor, caution is advised in administering PROGLYCEM  (r)  at that time.



    Nursing mothers:



  Information is not available concerning the passage of diazoxide in breast milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for adverse reactions from diazoxide in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.



    Pediatric use:



  (See  INDICATIONS AND USAGE  ).

  The antidiuretic property of diazoxide may lead to significant fluid retention, which in patients with compromised cardiac reserve, may precipitate congestive heart failure. The fluid retention will respond to conventional therapy with diuretics.



 It should be noted that concomitantly administered thiazides may potentiate the hyperglycemic and hyperuricemic actions of diazoxide (See  DRUG INTERACTIONS  and  ANIMAL PHARMACOLOGY AND/OR TOXICOLOGY  ).



 Ketoacidosis and nonketotic hyperosmolar coma have been reported in patients treated with recommended doses of PROGLYCEM  (r)  usually during intercurrent illness. Prompt recognition and treatment are essential (See  OVERDOSAGE  ), and prolonged surveillance following the acute episode is necessary because of the long drug half-life of approximately 30 hours. The occurrence of these serious events may be reduced by careful education of patients regarding the need for monitoring the urine for sugar and ketones and for prompt reporting of abnormal findings and unusual symptoms to the physician. Transient cataracts occurred in association with hyperosmolar coma in an infant, and subsided on correction of the hyper-osmolarity. Cataracts have been observed in several animals receiving daily doses of intravenous or oral diazoxide.



 The development of abnormal facial features in four children treated chronically (&gt;4 years) with PROGLYCEM  (r)  for hypoglycemia hyperinsulinism in the same clinic has been reported.



  Pulmonary Hypertension in Neonates and Infants  



 There have been postmarketing reports of pulmonary hypertension occurring in infants and neonates treated with diazoxide. The cases were reversible upon discontinuation of the drug. Monitor patients, especially those with risk factors for pulmonary hypertension, for respiratory distress and discontinue diazoxide if pulmonary hypertension is suspected.
