  The principal and potentially serious toxic effects of AZASAN  (r)  are hematologic and gastrointestinal. The risks of secondary infection and malignancy are also significant (see  WARNINGS  ). The frequency and severity of adverse reactions depend on the dose and duration of AZASAN  (r)  as well as on the patient's underlying disease or concomitant therapies. The incidence of hematologic toxicities and neoplasia encountered in groups of renal homograft recipients is significantly higher than that in studies employing AZASAN  (r)  for rheumatoid arthritis. The relative incidences in clinical studies are summarized below:

 Lekopenia                                                                         
 Any Degree                 &gt;50%                       28%

 Others                     2.8%                                                   
      
 

 Data on the rate and risk of neoplasia among persons with rheumatoid arthritis treated with azathioprine are limited. The incidence of lymphoproliferative disease in patients with RA appears to be significantly higher than that in the general population. In one completed study, the rate of lymphoproliferative disease in RA patients receiving higher than recommended doses of azathioprine (5 mg/kg/day) was 1.8 cases per 1000 patient-years of follow-up, compared with 0.8 cases per 1000 patient years of follow-up in those not receiving azathioprine. However, the proportion of the increased risk attributable to the azathioprine dosage or to other therapies (i.e., alkylating agents) received by patients treated with azathioprine cannot be determined.



   Hematologic:  Leukopenia and/or thrombocytopenia are dose-dependent and may occur late in the course of therapy with AZASAN  (r)  . Dose reduction or temporary withdrawal may result in reversal of these toxicities. Infection may occur as a secondary manifestation of bone marrow suppression or leukopenia, but the incidence of infection in renal homotransplantation is 30 to 60 times that in rheumatoid arthritis. Anemias, including macrocytic anemia and/or bleeding have been reported.



 TPMT genotyping or phenotyping can help identify patients with low or absent TPMT activity (homozygous for nonfunctional alleles) who are at increased risk for severe, life-threatening myelosuppression from AZASAN  (r)  . See  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  ,  WARNINGS  and  PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests  . Death associated with pancytopenia has been reported in patients with absent TPMT activity receiving



 azathioprine.  6, 20  



   Gastrointestinal:  Nausea and vomiting may occur within the first few months of therapy with AZASAN  (r)  , and occurred in approximately 12% of 676 rheumatoid arthritis patients. The frequency of gastric disturbance often can be reduced by administration of the drug in divided doses and/ or after meals. However, in some patients, nausea and vomiting may be severe and may be accompanied by symptoms such as diarrhea, fever, malaise, and myalgias (see  PRECAUTIONS  ). Vomiting with abdominal pain may occur rarely with a hypersensitivity pancreatitis. Hepatotoxicity manifest by elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and/ or serum transaminases is known to occur following azathioprine use, primarily in allograft recipients. Hepatotoxicity has been uncommon (less than 1%) in rheumatoid arthritis patients. Hepatotoxicity following transplantation most often occurs within 6 months of transplantation and is generally reversible after interruption of AZASAN  (r)  . A rare, but life-threatening hepatic veno-occlusive disease associated with chronic administration of azathioprine has been described in transplant patients and in one patient receiving azathioprine for panuveitis.  21, 22, 23  Periodic measurement of serum transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin is indicated for early detection of hepatotoxicity. If hepatic veno-occlusive disease is clinically suspected, AZASAN  (r)  should be permanently withdrawn.



   Others:  Additional side effects of low frequency have been reported. These include skin rashes, alopecia, fever, arthralgias, diarrhea, steatorrhea, negative nitrogen balance, reversible interstitial pneumonitis, hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (see  Warnings - Malignancy  ), and Sweet's Syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis).

    BOXED WARNING: 

    WARNING - 

     MALIGNANCY     Chronic immunosuppression with this purine antimetabolite increases 

    risk of malignancy   in humans. Reports of malignancy include post-transplant lymphoma and hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Physicians using this drug should be very familiar with this risk as well as with the mutagenic potential to both men and women and with possible hematologic toxicities. Physicians should inform patients of the risk of malignancy with

 



 AZASAN

    (r)  . See 

    WARNINGS  .
</Section>
    <Section id="S3" name="precautions">    PRECAUTIONS



      General:  A gastrointestinal hypersensitivity reaction characterized by severe nausea and vomiting has been reported. These symptoms may also be accompanied by diarrhea, rash, fever, malaise, myalgias, elevations in liver enzymes, and occasionally, hypotension. Symptoms of gastrointestinal toxicity most often develop within the first several weeks of therapy with AZASAN  (r)  and are reversible upon discontinuation of the drug. The reaction can recur within hours after rechallenge with a single dose of AZASAN  (r)  .
 

     Information for Patients:  Patients being started on AZASAN  (r)  should be informed of the necessity of periodic blood counts while they are receiving the drug and should be encouraged to report any unusual bleeding or bruising to their physician. They should be informed of the danger of infection while receiving AZASAN  (r)  and asked to report signs and symptoms of infection to their physician. Careful dosage instructions should be given to the patient, especially when AZASAN  (r)  is being administered in the presence of impaired renal function or concomitantly with allopurinol (see  Drug Interactions  subsection and  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  ). Patients should be advised of the potential risks of the use of AZASAN  (r)  during pregnancy and during the nursing period. The increased risk of malignancy following therapy with AZASAN  (r)  should be explained to the patient.
 

     Laboratory Tests: Complete Blood Count (CBC) Monitoring:  Patients on AZASAN  (r)  should have complete blood counts, including platelet counts, weekly during the first month, twice monthly for the second and third months of treatment, then monthly or more frequently if dosage alterations or other therapy changes are necessary.
 

     TPMT Testing:  It is recommended that consideration be given to either genotype or phenotype patients for TPMT. Phenotyping and genotyping methods are commercially available. The most common non-functional alleles associated with reduced levels of TPMT activity are TPMT*2, TPMT*3A and TPMT*3C. Patients with two non-functional alleles (homozygous) have low or absent TPMT activity and those with one non-functional allele (heterozygous) have intermediate activity. Accurate phenotyping (red blood cell TPMT activity) results are not possible in patients who have received recent blood transfusions. TPMT testing may also be considered in patients with abnormal CBC results that do not respond to dose reduction. Early drug discontinuation in these patients is advisable. TPMT TESTING CANNOT SUBSTITUTE FOR COMPLETE BLOOD COUNT (CBC) MONITORING IN PATIENTS RECEIVING AZASAN    (r)  . See  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  ,  WARNINGS  ,  ADVERSE REACTIONS  and  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  sections.
 

     Drug Interactions: Use with Allopurinol:    One of the pathways for inactivation of azathioprine is inhibited by allopurinol. Patients receiving AZASAN  (r)  and allopurinol concomitantly should have a dose reduction of AZASAN  (r)  , to approximately 1/3 to 1/4 the usual dose. It is recommended that a further dose reduction or alternative therapies be considered for patients with low or absent TPMT activity receiving AZASAN  (r)  and allopurinol because both TPMT and XO inactivation pathways are affected. See  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  ,  WARNINGS  ,  PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests  and  ADVERSE REACTIONS  sections.
 

   Use with Aminosalicylates:    There is in vitro evidence that aminosalicylate derivatives (e.g., sulphasalazine, mesalazine, or olsalazine) inhibit the TPMT enzyme. Concomitant use of these agents with AZASAN  (r)  should be done with caution.



   Use with Other Agents Affecting Myelopoesis:    Drugs which may affect leukocyte production, including co-trimoxazole, may lead to exaggerated leukopenia, especially in renal transplant recipients.



   Use with Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors:    The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors to control hypertension in patients on azathioprine has been reported to induce anemia and severe leukopenia.



   Use with Warfarin:    AZASAN(r) may inhibit the anticoagulant effect of warfarin.



   Use with ribavirin:    The use of ribavirin for hepatitis C in patients receiving azathioprine has been reported to induce severe pancytopenia and may increase the risk of azathioprine-related myelotoxicity. Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMDH) is required for one of the metabolic pathways of azathioprine. Ribavirin is known to inhibit IMDH, thereby leading to accumulation of an azathioprine metabolite, 6-methylthioionosine monophosphate (6-MTITP), which is associated with myelotoxicity (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia). Patients receiving azathioprine with ribavirin should have complete blood counts, including platelet counts, monitored weekly for the first month, twice monthly for the second and third months of treatment, then monthly or more frequently if dosage or other therapy changes are necessary.



     Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:  See  WARNINGS  section.
 

     Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects:       Pregnancy Category D. See  WARNINGS  section.
 

     Nursing Mothers:  The use of AZASAN  (r)  in nursing mothers is not recommended. Azathioprine or its metabolites are transferred at low levels, both transplacentally and in breast milk.  17, 18, 19  Because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for azathioprine, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.
 

     Pediatric Use:  Safety and efficacy of azathioprine in pediatric patients have not been established.

   Malignancy  Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including AZASAN  (r)  , are at increased risk of developing lymphoma and other malignancies, particularly of the skin. Physicians should inform patients of the risk of malignancy with AZASAN  (r)  . As usual for patients with increased risk for skin cancer, exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor.  
 

    Post-transplant:Renal transplant patients are known to have an increased risk of malignancy, predominantly skin cancer and reticulum cell or lymphomatous tumors. The risk of post-transplant lymphomas may be increased in patients who receive aggressive treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, including AZASAN  (r)  . Therefore, immunosuppressive drug therapy should be maintained at the lowest effective levels.
 

    Rheumatoid Arthritis:Information is available on the risk of malignancy with the use of azathioprine in rheumatoid arthritis (see  ADVERSE REACTIONS  ). It has not been possible to define the precise risk of malignancy due to azathioprine. The data suggest the risk may be elevated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, though lower than for renal transplant patients. However, acute myelogenous leukemia as well as solid tumors have been reported in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who have received azathioprine.
 

    Inflammatory Bowel DiseasePostmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have been reported in patients treated with azathioprine. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. The majority of reported cases have occurred in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and the majority were in adolescent and young adult males. Some of the patients were treated with azathioprine as monotherapy and some had received concomitant treatment with a TNFalpha blocker at or prior to diagnosis. The safety and efficacy of AZASAN  (r)  for the treatment of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis have not been established.
 

     Cytopenias:  Severe leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemias including macrocytic and/or pancytopenia may occur in patients being treated with AZASAN  (r)  . Severe bone marrow suppression may also occur. Patients with intermediate thiopurine S-methyl transferase (TPMT) activity may be at an increased risk of myelotoxicity if receiving conventional doses of AZASAN  (r)  . Patients with low or absent TPMT activity are at an increased risk of developing severe, life-threatening myelotoxicity if receiving conventional doses of AZASAN(r). TPMT genotyping or phenotyping can help identify patients who are at an increased risk for developing AZASAN  (r)  toxicity.  2-9     (See  PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests  ). Hematologic toxicities are dose-related and may be more severe in renal transplant patients whose homograft is undergoing rejection. It is suggested that patients on AZASAN  (r)  have complete blood counts, including platelet counts, weekly during the first month, twice monthly for the second and third months of treatment, then monthly or more frequently if dosage alterations or other therapy changes are necessary. Delayed hematologic suppression may occur. Prompt reduction in dosage or temporary withdrawal of the drug may be necessary if there is a rapid fall in or persistently low leukocyte count, or other evidence of bone marrow depression. Leukopenia does not correlate with therapeutic effect; therefore, the dose should not be increased intentionally to lower the white blood cell count.
 

     Serious infections  Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including azathioprine, are at increased risk for bacterial, viral, fungal, protozoal, and opportunistic infections, including reactivation of latent infections. These infections may lead to serious, including fatal outcomes.
 

    Progressive Multifocal LeukoencephalopathyCases of JC virus-associated infection resulting in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal, have been reported in patients treated with immunosuppressants, including azathioprine. Risk factors for PML include treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. Consider the diagnosis of PML in any patient presenting with new-onset neurological manifestations and consider consultation with a neurologist as clinically indicated. Consider reducing the amount of immunosuppression in patients who develop PML. In transplant patients, consider the risk that the reduced immunosuppression represents to the graft.
 

     Effect on Sperm in Animals:  Azathioprine has been reported to cause temporary depression in spermatogenesis and reduction in sperm viability and sperm count in mice at doses 10 times the human therapeutic dose;10 a reduced percentage of fertile matings occurred when animals received 5 mg/kg.  11  
 

     Pregnancy: Pregnancy Category D  . AZASAN  (r)  can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. AZASAN  (r)  should not be given during pregnancy without careful weighing of risk versus benefit. Whenever possible, use of AZASAN  (r)  in pregnant patients should be avoided. This drug should not be used for treating rheumatoid arthritis in pregnant women.  12  
 

 AZASAN  (r)  is teratogenic in rabbits and mice when given in doses equivalent to the human dose (5 mg/kg daily). Abnormalities included skeletal malformations and visceral anomalies.  11  



 Limited immunologic and other abnormalities have occurred in a few infants born of renal allograft recipients on AZASAN  (r)  . In a detailed case report,  13  documented lymphopenia, diminished IgG and IgM levels, CMV infection, and a decreased thymic shadow were noted in an infant born to a mother receiving 150 mg azathioprine and 30 mg prednisone daily throughout pregnancy. At 10 weeks most features were normalized. DeWitte et al reported pancytopenia and severe immune deficiency in a preterm infant whose mother received 125 mg azathioprine and 12.5 mg prednisone daily.  14  There have been two published reports of abnormal physical findings. Williamson and Karp described an infant born with preaxial polydactyly whose mother received azathioprine 200 mg daily and prednisone 20 mg every other day during pregnancy.  15  Tallent et al described an infant with a large myelomeningocele in the upper lumbar region, bilateral dislocated hips, and bilateral talipes equinovarus. The father was on long-term azathioprine therapy.  16  



 Benefit versus risk must be weighed carefully before use of AZASAN  (r)  in patients of reproductive potential. There are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of childbearing age should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant.
