  6.1       Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



   Adverse Reactions in    Patients with Cancer Receiving Myelosuppressive Chemotherapy  



 The following adverse reaction data in Table 2 are from three randomized, placebo-controlled studies in patients with:



 *  small cell lung cancer receiving standard dose chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide (Study 1) 
 *  small cell lung cancer receiving ifosfamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide (Study 2), and 
 *  non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) receiving doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vindesine, bleomycin, methylprednisolone, and methotrexate ("ACVBP") or mitoxantrone, ifosfamide, mitoguazone, teniposide, methotrexate, folinic acid, methylprednisolone, and methotrexate ("VIM3") (Study 3). 
    A total of 451 patients were randomized to receive subcutaneous NEUPOGEN 230 mcg/m  2  (Study 1), 240 mcg/m  2  (Study 2) or 4 or 5 mcg/kg/day (Study 3) (n = 294) or placebo (n = 157). The patients in these studies were median age 61 (range 29 to 78) years and 64% were male. The ethnicity was 95% Caucasian, 4% African American, and 1% Asian.

 Adverse events with &gt;= 5% higher incidence in NEUPOGEN patients compared to placebo and associated with the sequelae of the underlying malignancy or cytotoxic chemotherapy delivered included anemia, constipation, diarrhea, oral pain, vomiting, asthenia, malaise, edema peripheral, hemoglobin decreased, decreased appetite, oropharyngeal pain, and alopecia.



   Adverse Reactions in    Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia  



 Adverse reaction data below are from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with AML (Study 4) who received an induction chemotherapy regimen of intravenous daunorubicin days 1, 2, and 3; cytosine arabinoside days 1 to 7; and etoposide days 1 to 5 and up to 3 additional courses of therapy (induction 2, and consolidation 1, 2) of intravenous daunorubicin, cytosine arabinoside, and etoposide. The safety population included 518 patients randomized to receive either 5 mcg/kg/day NEUPOGEN (n = 257) or placebo (n = 261). The median age was 54 (range 16 to 89) years and 54% were male.



 Adverse reactions with &gt;= 2% higher incidence in NEUPOGEN patients compared to placebo included epistaxis, back pain, pain in extremity, erythema, and rash maculo-papular.



 Adverse events with &gt;= 2% higher incidence in NEUPOGEN patients compared to placebo and associated with the sequelae of the underlying malignancy or cytotoxic chemotherapy included diarrhea, constipation, and transfusion reaction.



   Adverse Reactions in    Patients with Cancer Undergoing Bone Marrow Transplantation  



 The following adverse reaction data are from one randomized, no treatment-controlled study in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoblastic lymphoma receiving high-dose chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide or cytarabine, and melphalan) and total body irradiation (Study 5) and one randomized, no treatment-controlled study in patients with Hodgkin's disease (HD) and NHL undergoing high-dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation (Study 6). Patients receiving autologous bone marrow transplantation only were included in the analysis. A total of 100 patients received either 30 mcg/kg/day as a 4-hour infusion (Study 5) or 10 mcg/kg/day or 30 mcg/kg/day as a 24-hour infusion (Study 6) NEUPOGEN (n = 72), no treatment control or placebo (n = 28). The median age was 30 (range 15 to 57) years, 57% were male.



 Adverse reactions with &gt;= 5% higher incidence in NEUPOGEN patients compared to patients receiving no NEUPOGEN included rash and hypersensitivity.



 Adverse reactions in patients receiving intensive chemotherapy followed by autologous BMT with &gt;= 5% higher incidence in NEUPOGEN patients compared to patients receiving no NEUPOGEN included thrombocytopenia, anemia, hypertension, sepsis, bronchitis, and insomnia.



   Adverse Reactions in    Patients with Cancer Undergoing Autologous         Peripheral Blood Progenitor Cell Collection  



 The adverse reaction data in Table 3 are from a series of 7 trials in patients with cancer undergoing mobilization of autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells for collection by leukapheresis. Patients (n = 166) in all these trials underwent a similar mobilization/collection regimen: NEUPOGEN was administered for 6 to 8 days, in most cases the apheresis procedure occurred on days 5, 6, and 7.  The dosage of NEUPOGEN ranged between 5 to 30 mcg/kg/day and was administered subcutaneously by injection or continuous infusion.  The median age was 39 (range 15 to 67) years, and 48% were male.

          Adverse Reactions in    Patients with Severe Chronic Neutropenia  
 

 The following adverse reaction data were identified in a randomized, controlled study in patients with SCN receiving NEUPOGEN (Study 7). 123 patients were randomized to a 4-month observation period followed by subcutaneous NEUPOGEN treatment or immediate subcutaneous NEUPOGEN treatment.  The median age was 12 years (range 7 months to 76 years) and 46% were male.  The dosage of NEUPOGEN was determined by the category of neutropenia.  Initial dosage of NEUPOGEN:



 *  Idiopathic neutropenia: 3.6 mcg/kg/day 
 *  Cyclic neutropenia: 6 mcg/kg/day 
 *  Congenital neutropenia: 6 mcg/kg/day divided 2 times per day 
    The dosage was increased incrementally to 12 mcg/kg/day divided 2 times per day if there was no response.
 

 Adverse reactions with &gt;= 5% higher incidence in NEUPOGEN patients compared to patients receiving no NEUPOGEN included arthralgia, bone pain, back pain, muscle spasms, musculoskeletal pain, pain in extremity, splenomegaly, anemia, upper respiratory tract infection, and urinary tract infection (upper respiratory tract infection and urinary tract infection were higher in the NEUPOGEN arm, total infection related events were lower in NEUPOGEN treated patients), epistaxis, chest pain, diarrhea, hypoesthesia, and alopecia.



   6.2       Immunogenicity

  As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay, and the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to filgrastim in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading.



 The incidence of antibody development in patients receiving NEUPOGEN has not been adequately determined. While available data suggest that a small proportion of patients developed binding antibodies to filgrastim, the nature and specificity of these antibodies has not been adequately studied. In clinical studies using NEUPOGEN, the incidence of antibodies binding to filgrastim was 3% (11/333). In these 11 patients, no evidence of a neutralizing response was observed using a cell based bioassay.  



 Cytopenias resulting from an antibody response to exogenous growth factors have been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with other recombinant growth factors.



   6.3       Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of NEUPOGEN. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">     5         WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  



   EXCERPT:    *  Fatal splenic rupture: Evaluate patients who report left upper abdominal or shoulder pain for an enlarged spleen or splenic rupture. (  5.1  ) 
 *  Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS ) : Evaluate patients who develop fever and lung infiltrates or respiratory distress for ARDS. Discontinue NEUPOGEN in patients with ARDS. (  5.2  ) 
 *  Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis: Permanently discontinue NEUPOGEN in patients with serious allergic reactions. (  5.3  ) 
 *  Fatal sickle cell crises: Have occurred. (  5.4  ) 
 *  Glomerulonephritis: Evaluate and consider dose-reduction or interruption of NEUPOGEN if causality is likely. (  5.5  ) 
    
 

   5.1       Splenic Rupture



  Splenic rupture, including fatal cases, has been reported following the administration of NEUPOGEN. Evaluate patients who report left upper abdominal or shoulder pain for an enlarged spleen or splenic rupture.



    5.2       Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome



  Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been reported in patients receiving NEUPOGEN. Evaluate patients who develop fever and lung infiltrates or respiratory distress for ARDS. Discontinue NEUPOGEN in patients with ARDS.



    5.3       Serious Allergic Reactions



  Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients receiving NEUPOGEN. The majority of reported events occurred upon initial exposure. Provide symptomatic treatment for allergic reactions. Allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, in patients receiving NEUPOGEN can recur within days after the discontinuation of initial anti-allergic treatment. Permanently discontinue NEUPOGEN in patients with serious allergic reactions. NEUPOGEN is contraindicated in patients with a history of serious allergic reactions to human granulocyte colony-stimulating factors such as filgrastim or pegfilgrastim.



    5.4       Sickle Cell Disorders



  Severe and sometimes fatal sickle cell crises can occur in patients with sickle cell disorders receiving filgrastim products. Discontinue NEUPOGEN if sickle cell crisis occurs.



    5.5       Glomerulonephritis



  Glomerulonephritis has occurred in patients receiving NEUPOGEN.  The diagnoses were based upon azotemia, hematuria (microscopic and macroscopic), proteinuria, and renal biopsy.  Generally, events of glomerulonephritis resolved after dose reduction or discontinuation of NEUPOGEN. If glomerulonephritis is suspected, evaluate for cause. If causality is likely, consider dose-reduction or interruption of NEUPOGEN.  



    5.6       Alveolar Hemorrhage and Hemoptysis



  Alveolar hemorrhage manifesting as pulmonary infiltrates and hemoptysis requiring hospitalization have been reported in NEUPOGEN-treated healthy donors undergoing peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) collection mobilization. Hemoptysis resolved with discontinuation of NEUPOGEN. The use of NEUPOGEN for PBPC mobilization in healthy donors is not an approved indication.



    5.7       Capillary Leak Syndrome



  Capillary leak syndrome (CLS) has been reported after G-CSF administration, including NEUPOGEN, and is characterized by hypotension, hypoalbuminemia, edema and hemoconcentration.  Episodes vary in frequency, severity and may be life-threatening if treatment is delayed.  Patients who develop symptoms of capillary leak syndrome should be closely monitored and receive standard symptomatic treatment, which may include a need for intensive care.



    5.8       Patients with Severe Chronic Neutropenia



  Confirm the diagnosis of SCN before initiating NEUPOGEN therapy.



 Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) have been reported to occur in the natural history of congenital neutropenia without cytokine therapy. Cytogenetic abnormalities, transformation to MDS, and AML have also been observed in patients treated with NEUPOGEN for SCN. Based on available data including a postmarketing surveillance study, the risk of developing MDS and AML appears to be confined to the subset of patients with congenital neutropenia. Abnormal cytogenetics and MDS have been associated with the eventual development of myeloid leukemia. The effect of NEUPOGEN on the development of abnormal cytogenetics and the effect of continued NEUPOGEN administration in patients with abnormal cytogenetics or MDS are unknown. If a patient with SCN develops abnormal cytogenetics or myelodysplasia, the risks and benefits of continuing NEUPOGEN should be carefully considered.



    5.9       Thrombocytopenia



  Thrombocytopenia has been reported in patients receiving NEUPOGEN. Monitor platelet counts.



    5.10       Leukocytosis



   Patients with Cancer Receiving Myelosuppressive Chemotherapy  



 White blood cell counts of 100,000/mm  3  or greater were observed in approximately 2% of patients receiving NEUPOGEN at dosages above 5 mcg/kg/day.  In patients with cancer receiving NEUPOGEN as an adjunct to myelosuppressive chemotherapy, to avoid the potential risks of excessive leukocytosis, it is recommended that NEUPOGEN therapy be discontinued if the ANC surpasses 10,000/mm  3  after the chemotherapy-induced ANC nadir has occurred.  Monitor CBCs at least twice weekly during therapy. Dosages of NEUPOGEN that increase the ANC beyond 10,000/mm  3  may not result in any additional clinical benefit.  In patients with cancer receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy, discontinuation of NEUPOGEN therapy usually resulted in a 50% decrease in circulating neutrophils within 1 to 2 days, with a return to pretreatment levels in 1 to 7 days.



  Peripheral Blood Progenitor Cell Collection and Therapy  



 During the period of administration of NEUPOGEN for PBPC mobilization in patients with cancer, discontinue NEUPOGEN if the leukocyte count rises to &gt; 100,000/mm  3  .



    5.11       Cutaneous Vasculitis



  Cutaneous vasculitis has been reported in patients treated with NEUPOGEN. In most cases, the severity of cutaneous vasculitis was moderate or severe. Most of the reports involved patients with SCN receiving long-term NEUPOGEN therapy. Hold NEUPOGEN therapy in patients with cutaneous vasculitis. NEUPOGEN may be started at a reduced dose when the symptoms resolve and the ANC has decreased.



    5.12       Potential Effect on Malignant Cells



  NEUPOGEN is a growth factor that primarily stimulates neutrophils. The granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor through which filgrastim acts has also been found on tumor cell lines. The possibility that filgrastim acts as a growth factor for any tumor type cannot be excluded. The safety of filgrastim in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and myelodysplasia has not been established.



 When NEUPOGEN is used to mobilize PBPC, tumor cells may be released from the marrow and subsequently collected in the leukapheresis product. The effect of reinfusion of tumor cells has not been well studied, and the limited data available are inconclusive.



    5.13       Simultaneous Use with Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy Not Recommended



  The safety and efficacy of NEUPOGEN given simultaneously with cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been established. Because of the potential sensitivity of rapidly dividing myeloid cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy, do not use NEUPOGEN in the period 24 hours before through 24 hours after the administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy [see Dosage and Administration (     2.2     )]  .



 The safety and efficacy of NEUPOGEN have not been evaluated in patients receiving concurrent radiation therapy. Avoid the simultaneous use of NEUPOGEN with chemotherapy and radiation therapy.



    5.14       Nuclear Imaging



  Increased hematopoietic activity of the bone marrow in response to growth factor therapy has been associated with transient positive bone-imaging changes. This should be considered when interpreting bone-imaging results.



    5.15       Aortitis



   Aortitis has been reported in patients receiving NEUPOGEN. It may occur as early as the first week after start of therapy. Manifestations may include generalized signs and symptoms such as fever, abdominal pain, malaise, back pain, and increased inflammatory markers (e.g., c-reactive protein and white blood cell count). Consider aortitis in patients who develop these signs and symptoms without known etiology. Discontinue NEUPOGEN if aortitis is suspected.
