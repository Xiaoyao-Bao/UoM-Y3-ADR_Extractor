      Clinical Trials Experience
   Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 ULTRAM was administered to 550 patients during the double-blind or open-label extension periods in U.S. studies of chronic nonmalignant pain. Of these patients, 375 were 65 years old or older. Table 2 reports the cumulative incidence rate of adverse reactions by 7, 30 and 90 days for the most frequent reactions (5% or more by 7 days). The most frequently reported events were in the central nervous system and gastrointestinal system. Although the reactions listed in the table are felt to be probably related to ULTRAM administration, the reported rates also include some events that may have been due to underlying disease or concomitant medication. The overall incidence rates of adverse experiences in these trials were similar for ULTRAM and the active control groups, TYLENOL with Codeine #3 (acetaminophen 300 mg with codeine phosphate 30 mg), and aspirin 325 mg with codeine phosphate 30 mg, however, the rates of withdrawals due to adverse events appeared to be higher in the ULTRAM groups.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: ADDICTION, ABUSE, AND MISUSE; RISK EVALUATION AND MITIGATION STRATEGY (REMS); LIFE-THREATENING RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION; ACCIDENTAL INGESTION; ULTRA-RAPID METABOLISM OF TRAMADOL AND OTHER RISK FACTORS FOR LIFE-THREATENING RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION IN CHILDREN; NEONATAL OPIOID WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME; INTERACTIONS WITH DRUGS AFFECTING CYTOCHROME P450 ISOENZYMES; and RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH BENZODIAZEPINES OR OTHER CNS DEPRESSANTS

  WARNING: ADDICTION, ABUSE, AND MISUSE; RISK EVALUATION AND MITIGATION STRATEGY (REMS); LIFE-THREATENING RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION; ACCIDENTAL INGESTION; ULTRA-RAPID METABOLISM OF TRAMADOL AND OTHER RISK FACTORS FOR LIFE-THREATENING RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION IN CHILDREN; NEONATAL OPIOID WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME; INTERACTIONS WITH DRUGS AFFECTING CYTOCHROME P450 ISOENZYMES; and RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH BENZODIAZEPINES OR OTHER CNS DEPRESSANTS

  ADDICTION, ABUSE AND MISUSE

    ULTRAM exposes patients and other users to the risks of opioid addiction, abuse and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess each patient's risk prior to prescribing ULTRAM, and monitor all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors and conditions (see   WARNINGS  ).  



   OPIOID ANALGESIC RISK EVALUATION AND MITIGATION STRATEGY (REMS)

    To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a REMS for these products (see   WARNINGS  ). Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to  



 *  complete a REMS-compliant education program, 
 *  counsel patients and/or their caregivers, with every prescription, on safe use, serious risks, storage, and disposal of these products, 
 *  emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide every time it is provided by their pharmacist, and 
 *  consider other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety. 
      LIFE-THREATENING RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION
     Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of ULTRAM. Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of ULTRAM or following a dose increase (see   WARNINGS  ).  



   ACCIDENTAL INGESTION

    Accidental ingestion of ULTRAM, especially by children, can be fatal. (see   WARNINGS  ).  



   ULTRA-RAPID METABOLISM OF TRAMADOL AND OTHER RISK FACTORS FOR LIFE-THREATENING RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION IN CHILDREN

    Life-threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received tramadol. Some of the reported cases followed tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy; in at least one case, the child had evidence of being an ultra-rapid metabolizer of tramadol due to a CYP2D6 polymorphism (see   WARNINGS  ). ULTRAM is contraindicated in children younger than 12 years of age and in children younger than 18 years of age following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy (see   CONTRAINDICATIONS  ). Avoid the use of ULTRAM in adolescents 12 to 18 years of age who have other risk factors that may increase their sensitivity to the respiratory depressant effects of tramadol (see   WARNINGS  ).  



   NEONATAL OPIOID WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME

    Prolonged use of ULTRAM during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available (see   WARNINGS  ).  



   INTERACTIONS WITH DRUGS AFFECTING CYTOCHROME P450 ISOENZYMES

    The effects of concomitant use or discontinuation of cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, 3A4 inhibitors, or 2D6 inhibitors with tramadol are complex. Use of cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, 3A4 inhibitors, or 2D6 inhibitors with ULTRAM requires careful consideration of the effects on the parent drug, tramadol, and the active metabolite, M1 (see   WARNINGS  ,   PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions  ).  



   RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH BENZODIAZEPINES OR OTHER CNS DEPRESSANTS

    Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death (see   WARNINGS  ,   PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions  ).  



 *  Reserve concomitant prescribing of ULTRAM and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. 
 *  Limit treatment to the minimum effective dosages and durations. 
 *  Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.

    <Section id="S3" name="precautions">    PRECAUTIONS



   Renal and Hepatic Disease



  Impaired renal function results in a decreased rate and extent of excretion of tramadol and its active metabolite, M1. In patients with creatinine clearances of less than 30 mL/min, dosing reduction is recommended (see   DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION    ). Metabolism of tramadol and M1 is reduced in patients with advanced cirrhosis of the liver. In cirrhotic patients, dosing reduction is recommended (see   DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION    ).



 With the prolonged half-life in these conditions, achievement of steady-state is delayed, so that it may take several days for elevated plasma concentrations to develop.



    Information for Patients



  Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).



    Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse



  Inform patients that the use of ULTRAM, even when taken as recommended, can result in addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death (see   WARNINGS    ). Instruct patients not to share ULTRAM with others and to take steps to protect ULTRAM from theft or misuse.



    Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression



  Inform patients of the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression, including information that the risk is greatest when starting ULTRAM or when the dosage is increased, and that it can occur even at recommended dosages (see   WARNINGS    ). Advise patients how to recognize respiratory depression and to seek medical attention if breathing difficulties develop.



    Accidental Ingestion



  Inform patients that accidental ingestion, especially by children, may result in respiratory depression or death (see   WARNINGS    ). Instruct patients to take steps to store ULTRAM securely and to dispose of unused ULTRAM in accordance with the local state guidelines and/or regulations.



    Ultra-Rapid Metabolism of Tramadol and Other Risk Factors for Life-threatening Respiratory Depression in Children



  Advise caregivers that ULTRAM is contraindicated in children younger than 12 years of age and in children younger than 18 years of age following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy. Advise caregivers of children ages 12 to 18 years of age receiving ULTRAM to monitor for signs of respiratory depression (see   WARNINGS    ).



    Interactions with Benzodiazepines and Other CNS Depressants



  Inform patients and caregivers that potentially fatal additive effects may occur if ULTRAM is used with benzodiazepines, CNS depressants, including alcohol, or some illicit drugs and not to use these concomitantly unless supervised by a healthcare provider (see   WARNINGS  ,  PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions    ).



    Serotonin Syndrome



  Inform patients that opioids could cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition resulting from concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs. Warn patients of the symptoms of serotonin syndrome, and to seek medical attention right away if symptoms develop. Instruct patients to inform their healthcare provider if they are taking, or plan to take serotonergic medications (see   WARNINGS    ).



    MAOI Interaction



  Inform patients not to take ULTRAM while using any drugs that inhibit monoamine oxidase. Patients should not start MAOIs while taking ULTRAM (see   PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions    ).



    Seizures



  Inform patients that ULTRAM may cause seizures with concomitant use of serotonergic agents (including SSRIs, SNRIs, and triptans) or drugs that significantly reduce the metabolic clearance of tramadol (see   WARNINGS    ).



    Adrenal Insufficiency



  Inform patients that opioids could cause adrenal insufficiency, a potentially life-threatening condition. Adrenal insufficiency may present with non-specific symptoms and signs such as nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. Advise patients to seek medical attention if they experience a constellation of these symptoms (see   WARNINGS    ).



    Important Administration Instructions



  Instruct patients how to properly take ULTRAM. (see   DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  ,  WARNINGS    )



 *  Advise patients not to adjust the dose of ULTRAM without consulting with a physician or other healthcare professional. 
 *  If patients have been receiving treatment with ULTRAM for more than a few weeks and cessation of therapy is indicated, counsel them on the importance of safely tapering the dose as abrupt discontinuation of the medication could precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Provide a dose schedule to accomplish a gradual discontinuation of the medication (see   DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION   ). 
       Hypotension
 

  Inform patients that ULTRAM may cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope. Instruct patients how to recognize symptoms of low blood pressure and how to reduce the risk of serious consequences should hypotension occur (e.g., sit or lie down, carefully rise from a sitting or lying position) (see   WARNINGS    ).



    Anaphylaxis



  Inform patients that anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in ULTRAM. Advise patients how to recognize such a reaction and when to seek medical attention (see   CONTRAINDICATIONS  ,  ADVERSE REACTIONS    ).



    Pregnancy



   Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome



  Inform female patients of reproductive potential that prolonged use of ULTRAM during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated and that the patient should inform their healthcare provider if they have used opioids at any time during their pregnancy, especially near the time of birth. (see   WARNINGS  ,  PRECAUTIONS; Labor or Delivery    ).



    Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  Inform female patients of reproductive potential that ULTRAM may cause fetal harm and to inform the healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy (see   PRECAUTONS; Pregnancy    ) .  



    Lactation



  Advise women that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ULTRAM (see   PRECAUTIONS; Nursing Mothers    ).



    Infertility



  Inform patients that chronic use of opioids may cause reduced fertility. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible (see   PRECAUTIONS    ).



    Driving or Operating Heavy Machinery



  Inform patients that ULTRAM may impair the ability to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating heavy machinery. Advise patients not to perform such tasks until they know how they will react to the medication (see   WARNINGS    ).



    Constipation



  Advise patients of the potential for severe constipation, including management instructions and when to seek medical attention (see   ADVERSE REACTIONS    ).



    Disposal of Unused ULTRAM



  Advise patients to throw the unused ULTRAM in the household trash following these steps. 1) Remove the drugs from their original containers and mix with an undesirable substance, such as used coffee grounds or kitty litter (this makes the drug less appealing to children and pets, and unrecognizable to people who may intentionally go through the trash seeking drugs). 2) Place the mixture in a sealable bag, empty can, or other container to prevent the drug from leaking or breaking out of a garbage bag.



    Maximum single-dose and 24-hour dose



  Advise patients not to exceed the single-dose and 24-hour dose limit and the time interval between doses, since exceeding these recommendations can result in respiratory depression, seizures and death (see   DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  ;  WARNINGS    ).



    Drug Interactions



   Inhibitors of CYP2D6



  The concomitant use of ULTRAM and CYP2D6 inhibitors, such as quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine and bupropion, may result in an increase in the plasma concentration of tramadol and a decrease in the plasma concentration of M1, particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of ULTRAM is achieved. Since M1 is a more potent u-opioid agonist, decreased M1 exposure could result in decreased therapeutic effects, and may result in signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal in patients who had developed physical dependence to tramadol. Increased tramadol exposure can result in increased or prolonged therapeutic effects and increased risk for serious adverse events including seizures and serotonin syndrome.



 After stopping a CYP2D6 inhibitor, as the effects of the inhibitor decline, the tramadol plasma concentration will decrease and the M1 plasma concentration will increase which could increase or prolong therapeutic effects but also increase adverse reactions related to opioid toxicity, and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression (see   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY    ).



 If concomitant use of a CYP2D6 inhibitor is necessary, follow patients closely for adverse reactions including opioid withdrawal, seizures, and serotonin syndrome.



 If a CYP2D6 inhibitor is discontinued, consider lowering ULTRAM dosage until stable drug effects are achieved. Follow patients closely for adverse events including respiratory depression and sedation.



    Use With Quinidine



  Quinidine is a selective inhibitor of CYP2D6, so that concomitant administration of quinidine and ULTRAM results in increased concentrations of tramadol and reduced concentrations of M1. The clinical consequences of these findings are unknown.



    Inhibitors of CYP3A4



  The concomitant use of ULTRAM and CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), can increase the plasma concentration of tramadol, and may result in a greater amount of metabolism via CYP2D6 and greater levels of M1. Follow patients closely for increased risk of serious adverse events including seizures and serotonin syndrome, and adverse reactions related to opioid toxicity including potentially fatal respiratory depression, particularly when a CYP3A4 inhibitor is added after a stable dose of ULTRAM is achieved.



 After stopping a CYP3A4 inhibitor, as the effects of the inhibitor decline, the tramadol plasma concentration will decrease (see   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY    ), resulting in decreased opioid efficacy or a withdrawal syndrome in patients who had developed physical dependence to tramadol.



 If concomitant use is necessary, consider dosage reduction of ULTRAM until stable drug effects are achieved. Follow patients closely for seizures and serotonin syndrome, and signs of respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals. If a CYP3A4 inhibitor is discontinued, consider increasing the ULTRAM dosage until stable drug effects are achieved and follow patients for signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal.



    CYP3A4 Inducers



  The concomitant use of ULTRAM and CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine and phenytoin, can decrease the plasma concentration of tramadol resulting in decreased efficacy or onset of a withdrawal syndrome in patients who have developed physical dependence to tramadol (see   WARNINGS    ).



 After stopping a CYP3A4 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the tramadol plasma concentration will increase, which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic effects and adverse reactions, and may cause seizures and serotonin syndrome, and potentially fatal respiratory depression.



    Use With Carbamazepine



  Patients taking carbamazepine, a CYP3A4 inducer, may have a significantly reduced analgesic effect of tramadol. Because carbamazepine increases tramadol metabolism and because of the seizure risk associated with tramadol, concomitant administration of ULTRAM and carbamazepine is not recommended.



    Benzodiazepines and Other Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants



  Due to additive pharmacologic effects, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, increases the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death. Examples of other CNS depressants include other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, and some illicit drugs.



 Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit the treatment to the minimum effective dosages and durations. Follow patients closely for signs of respiratory depression and sedation (see   WARNINGS    ).



    Serotonergic Drugs



  The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome. Examples of these drugs include, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that effect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue).



 If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue ULTRAM immediately if serotonin syndrome is suspected.



    Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)



  Do not use ULTRAM in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment.



 MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome (see   WARNINGS    ) or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma) (see   WARNINGS    ). Examples of these drugs include, phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid.



    Digoxin



  Post-marketing surveillance has revealed rare reports of digoxin toxicity. Follow patients for signs of digoxin toxicity and adjust dosage of digoxin as needed.



    Warfarin



  Post-marketing surveillance of tramadol has revealed rare reports of alteration of warfarin effect, including elevation of prothrombin times. Monitor the prothrombin time of patients on warfarin for signs of an interaction and adjust the dosage of warfarin as needed.



    Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics



  Mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist opioid analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of ULTRAM and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Examples of these drugs include butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine and buprenorphine. Avoid concomitant use of these drugs.



    Muscle Relaxants



  Tramadol may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Monitor patients for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected and decrease the dosage of ULTRAM and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary.



    Diuretics



  Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. Monitor patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed.



    Anticholinergic Drugs



  The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when ULTRAM is used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs.



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility



   Carcinogenesis



  A slight, but statistically significant, increase in two common murine tumors, pulmonary and hepatic, was observed in an NMRI mouse carcinogenicity study, particularly in aged mice. Mice were dosed orally up to 30 mg/kg in the drinking water (0.36 times the maximum recommended human daily dosage or MRHD) for approximately two years, although the study was not done with the Maximum Tolerated Dose. This finding is not believed to suggest risk in humans. No evidence of carcinogenicity was noted in a rat 2-year carcinogenicity study testing oral doses of up to 30 mg/kg in the drinking water, 0.73 times the MRHD).



    Mutagenesis



  Tramadol was mutagenic in the presence of metabolic activation in the mouse lymphoma assay. Tramadol was not mutagenic in the in vitro  bacterial reverse mutation assay using Salmonella  and E. coli  (Ames), the mouse lymphoma assay in the absence of metabolic activation, the in vitro  chromosomal aberration assay, or the in vivo  micronucleus assay in bone marrow.



    Impairment of Fertility



  No effects on fertility were observed for tramadol at oral dose levels up to 50 mg/kg in male rats and 75 mg/kg in female rats. These dosages are 1.2 and 1.8 times the maximum recommended human daily dose based on body surface area, respectively.



    Pregnancy



   Risk Summary



  Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy may cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome. Available data with ULTRAM in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage.



 In animal reproduction studies, tramadol administration during organogenesis decreased fetal weights and reduced ossification in mice, rats, and rabbits at 1.4, 0.6, and 3.6 times the maximum recommended human daily dosage (MRHD). Tramadol decreased pup body weight and increased pup mortality at 1.2 and 1.9 times the MRHD (see  Data  ). Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.



 The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.



    Clinical Considerations



   Neonatal Adverse Reactions



  Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in respiratory depression and physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth.



 Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome can present as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms and signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly (see   WARNINGS    ).



 Neonatal seizures, neonatal withdrawal syndrome, fetal death and still birth have been reported during post-marketing.



    Labor or Delivery



  ULTRAM is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioids cross the placenta and may induce dependency of the fetus, acute respiratory depression in the newborn and/or psycho-physiologic effects associated with opioid exposure and withdrawal. An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Monitor newborns exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression.



 Use of opioid analgesics, including ULTRAM, may impact the duration of labor due to inhibitory actions on uterine contractions or facilitatory actions on cervical dilation.



 Tramadol has been shown to cross the placenta. The mean ratio of serum tramadol in the umbilical veins compared to maternal veins was 0.83 for 40 women given tramadol during labor.



 The effect of ULTRAM, if any, on the later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child is unknown.



    Data



   Animal Data



  Tramadol has been shown to be embryotoxic and fetotoxic in mice, (120 mg/kg), rats (25 mg/kg) and rabbits (75 mg/kg) at maternally toxic dosages, but was not teratogenic at these dose levels. These doses on a mg/m  2  basis are 1.4, 0.6, and 3.6 times the maximum recommended human daily dosage (MRHD) for mouse, rat and rabbit, respectively.



 No drug-related teratogenic effects were observed in progeny of mice (up to 140 mg/kg), rats (up to 80 mg/kg) or rabbits (up to 300 mg/kg) treated with tramadol by various routes. Embryo and fetal toxicity consisted primarily of decreased fetal weights, decreased skeletal ossification and increased supernumerary ribs at maternally toxic dose levels. Transient delays in developmental or behavioral parameters were also seen in pups from rat dams allowed to deliver. Embryo and fetal lethality were reported only in one rabbit study at 300 mg/kg, a dose that would cause extreme maternal toxicity in the rabbit. The dosages listed for mouse, rat and rabbit are 1.7, 1.9 and 14.6 times the MRHD, respectively.



 Tramadol was evaluated in pre- and post-natal studies in rats. Progeny of dams receiving oral (gavage) dose levels of 50 mg/kg 1.2 times the MRHD) or greater had decreased weights, and pup survival was decreased early in lactation at 80 mg/kg (1.9 times the MRHD).



    Nursing Mothers



   Risk Summary



  ULTRAM is not recommended for obstetrical preoperative medication or for post-delivery analgesia in nursing mothers because its safety in infants and newborns has not been studied.



 Tramadol and its metabolite, O  -desmethyltramadol (M1), are present in human milk. There is no information on the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. The M1 metabolite is more potent than tramadol in mu opioid receptor binding (see   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  )  . Published studies have reported tramadol and M1 in colostrum with administration of tramadol to nursing mothers in the early post-partum period .  Women who are ultra-rapid metabolizers of tramadol may have higher than expected serum levels of M1, potentially leading to higher levels of M1 in breast milk that can be dangerous in their breastfed infants. In women with normal tramadol metabolism, the amount of tramadol secreted into human milk is low and dose-dependent. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including excess sedation and respiratory depression in a breastfed infant, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ULTRAM (see   WARNINGS    ).



    Clinical Considerations



  If infants are exposed to ULTRAM through breast milk, they should be monitored for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breast-feeding is stopped.



    Data



  Following a single IV 100 mg dose of tramadol, the cumulative excretion in breast milk within 16 hours post dose was 100 mcg of tramadol (0.1% of the maternal dose) and 27 mcg of M1.



    Females and Males of Reproductive Potential



   Infertility



  Due to effects of androgen deficiency, chronic use of opioids may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible (see   ADVERSE REACTIONS    ).



    Pediatric Use



  The safety and effectiveness of ULTRAM in pediatric patients have not been established.



 Life-threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received tramadol (see   WARNINGS    ). In some of the reported cases, these events followed tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy, and one of the children had evidence of being an ultra-rapid metabolizer of tramadol (i.e., multiple copies of the gene for cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2D6). Children with sleep apnea may be particularly sensitive to the respiratory depressant effects of tramadol.



 Because of the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression and death:



 *  ULTRAM is contraindicated for all children younger than 12 years of age (see   CONTRAINDICATIONS   ). 
 *  ULTRAM is contraindicated for post-operative management in pediatric patients younger than 18 years of age following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy (see   CONTRAINDICATIONS   ). 
 *  Avoid the use of ULTRAM in adolescents 12 to 18 years of age who have other risk factors that may increase their sensitivity to the respiratory depressant effects of tramadol unless the benefits outweigh the risks. Risk factors include conditions associated with hypoventilation such as postoperative status, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, severe pulmonary disease, neuromuscular disease, and concomitant use of other medications that cause respiratory depression. 
       Geriatric Use
 

  A total of 455 elderly (65 years of age or older) subjects were exposed to ULTRAM in controlled clinical trials. Of those, 145 subjects were 75 years of age and older.



 In studies including geriatric patients, treatment-limiting adverse events were higher in subjects over 75 years of age compared to those under 65 years of age. Specifically, 30% of those over 75 years of age had gastrointestinal treatment-limiting adverse events compared to 17% of those under 65 years of age. Constipation resulted in discontinuation of treatment in 10% of those over 75.



 Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of ULTRAM slowly in geriatric patients and monitor closely for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression (see   WARNINGS    ).



 Tramadol is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

    <Section id="S4" name="warnings">    WARNINGS



   Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse



  ULTRAM contains tramadol, a Schedule IV controlled substance. As an opioid, ULTRAM exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse (see   DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE    ).



 Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed ULTRAM. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused.



 Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing ULTRAM, and monitor all patients receiving ULTRAM for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as ULTRAM, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of ULTRAM along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse.



 Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing ULTRAM. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug (see   PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients  )  . Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.



    Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)



  To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to do all of the following:



 *  Complete a REMS-compliant education program offered by an accredited provider of continuing education (CE) or another education program that includes all the elements of the FDA Education Blueprint for Health Care Providers Involved in the Management or Support of Patients with Pain. 
 *  Discuss the safe use, serious risks, and proper storage and disposal of opioid analgesics with patients and/or their caregivers every time these medicines are prescribed. The Patient Counseling Guide (PCG) can be obtained at this link: www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSPCG. 
 *  Emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide that they will receive from their pharmacist every time an opioid analgesic is dispensed to them. 
 *  Consider using other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety, such as patient-prescriber agreements that reinforce patient-prescriber responsibilities. 
    To obtain further information on the opioid analgesic REMS and for a list of accredited REMS CME/CE, call 1-800-503-0784, or log on to www.opioidanalgesicrems.com. The FDA Blueprint can be found at www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSBlueprint.
 

    Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression



  Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status (see   OVERDOSAGE    ). Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.



 While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of ULTRAM, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24-72 hours of initiating therapy with and following dosage increases of ULTRAM.



 To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of ULTRAM are essential (see   DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION    ). Overestimating the ULTRAM dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose.



 Accidental ingestion of even one dose of ULTRAM, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of tramadol.



    Ultra-Rapid Metabolism of Tramadol and Other Risk Factors for Life-threatening Respiratory Depression in Children



  Life-threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received tramadol. Tramadol and codeine are subject to variability in metabolism based upon CYP2D6 genotype (described below), which can lead to increased exposure to an active metabolite. Based upon post-marketing reports with tramadol or with codeine, children younger than 12 years of age may be more susceptible to the respiratory depressant effects of tramadol. Furthermore, children with obstructive sleep apnea who are treated with opioids for post-tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy pain may be particularly sensitive to their respiratory depressant effect. Because of the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression and death:



 *  ULTRAM is contraindicated for all children younger than 12 years of age (see   CONTRAINDICATIONS   ). 
 *  ULTRAM is contraindicated for post-operative management in pediatric patients younger than 18 years of age following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy (see   CONTRAINDICATIONS   ). 
 *  Avoid the use of ULTRAM in adolescents 12 to 18 years of age who have other risk factors that may increase their sensitivity to the respiratory depressant effects of tramadol unless the benefits outweigh the risks. Risk factors include conditions associated with hypoventilation such as postoperative status, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, severe pulmonary disease, neuromuscular disease, and concomitant use of other medications that cause respiratory depression. 
 *  As with adults, when prescribing opioids for adolescents, healthcare providers should choose the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time and inform patients and caregivers about these risks and the signs of opioid overdose (see   PRECAUTIONS/Pediatric Use  ,  OVERDOSAGE   ). 
       Nursing Mothers
 

  Tramadol is subject to the same polymorphic metabolism as codeine, with ultra-rapid metabolizers of CYP2D6 substrates being potentially exposed to life-threatening levels of the active metabolite O  -desmethyltramadol (M1). At least one death was reported in a nursing infant who was exposed to high levels of morphine in breast milk because the mother was an ultra-rapid metabolizer of codeine. A baby nursing from an ultra-rapid metabolizer mother taking ULTRAM could potentially be exposed to high levels of M1, and experience life-threatening respiratory depression. For this reason, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ULTRAM (see   PRECAUTIONS/Nursing Mothers    ).



    CYP2D6 Genetic Variability: Ultra-rapid metabolizer



  Some individuals may be ultra-rapid metabolizers because of a specific CYP2D6 genotype (e.g., gene duplications denoted as *1/*1*N or *1/*2*N). The prevalence of this CYP2D6 phenotype varies widely and has been estimated at 1 to 10% for Whites (European, North American), 3 to 4% for Blacks (African Americans), 1 to 2% for East Asians (Chinese, Japanese, Korean), and may be greater than 10% in certain racial/ethnic groups (i.e., Oceanian, Northern African, Middle Eastern, Ashkenazi Jews, Puerto Rican). These individuals convert tramadol into its active metabolite, O  -desmethyltramadol (M1), more rapidly and completely than other people. This rapid conversion results in higher than expected serum M1 levels. Even at labeled dosage regimens, individuals who are ultra- rapid metabolizers may have life-threatening or fatal respiratory depression or experience signs of overdose (such as extreme sleepiness, confusion, or shallow breathing) (see   OVERDOSAGE    ). Therefore, individuals who are ultra-rapid metabolizers should not use ULTRAM.



    Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome



  Prolonged use of ULTRAM during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available (see   PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients, Pregnancy    ).



    Risks of Interactions with Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes



  The effects of concomitant use or discontinuation of cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, 3A4 inhibitors, or 2D6 inhibitors on levels of tramadol and M1 from ULTRAM are complex. Use of cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, 3A4 inhibitors, or 2D6 inhibitors with ULTRAM requires careful consideration of the effects on the parent drug, tramadol which is a weak serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor and u-opioid agonist, and the active metabolite, M1, which is more potent than tramadol in u-opioid receptor binding (see   PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions    ).



    Risks of Concomitant Use or Discontinuation of Cytochrome P450 2D6 Inhibitors



  The concomitant use of ULTRAM with all cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibitors (e.g., amiodarone, quinidine) may result in an increase in tramadol plasma levels and a decrease in the levels of the active metabolite, M1. A decrease in M1 exposure in patients who have developed physical dependence to tramadol, may result in signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal and reduced efficacy. The effect of increased tramadol levels may be an increased risk for serious adverse events including seizures and serotonin syndrome.



 Discontinuation of a concomitantly used cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibitor may result in a decrease in tramadol plasma levels and an increase in active metabolite M1 levels, which could increase or prolong adverse reactions related to opioid toxicity and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.



 Follow patients receiving ULTRAM and any CYP2D6 inhibitor for the risk of serious adverse events including seizures and serotonin syndrome, signs and symptoms that may reflect opioid toxicity, and opioid withdrawal when ULTRAM is used in conjunction with inhibitors of CYP2D6 (see   PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions    ).



    Cytochrome P450 3A4 Interaction



  The concomitant use of ULTRAM with cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir) or discontinuation of a cytochrome P450 3A4 inducer such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may result in an increase in tramadol plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse reactions, increase the risk for serious adverse events including seizures and serotonin syndrome, and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.



 The concomitant use of ULTRAM with all cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers or discontinuation of a cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitor may result in lower tramadol levels. This may be associated with a decrease in efficacy, and in some patients, may result in signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal.



 Follow patients receiving ULTRAM and any CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer for the risk for serious adverse events including seizures and serotonin syndrome, signs and symptoms that may reflect opioid toxicity and opioid withdrawal when ULTRAM is used in conjunction with inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 (see   PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions    ).



    Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants



  Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of ULTRAM with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.



 Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics (see   PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions    ).



 If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.



 Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when ULTRAM is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs (see   PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions  ,  Information for Patients/Caregivers    ).



    Serotonin Syndrome Risk



  Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported with the use of tramadol, particularly during concomitant use with serotonergic drugs. Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including MAO inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue) (see   PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions    ). This may occur within the recommended dosage range.



 Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days of concomitant use, but may occur later than that. Discontinue ULTRAM if serotonin syndrome is suspected.



    Increased Risk of Seizure



  Seizures have been reported in patients receiving ULTRAM within the recommended dosage range. Spontaneous post-marketing reports indicate that seizure risk is increased with doses of ULTRAM above the recommended range. Concomitant use of ULTRAM increases the seizure risk in patients taking:



 *  Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRI antidepressants or anorectics), 
 *  Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and other tricyclic compounds (e.g., cyclobenzaprine, promethazine, etc.), or 
 *  Other opioids, 
 *  MAO inhibitors (see also   WARNINGS, Serotonin Syndrome Risk   ), 
 *  Neuroleptics, or 
 *  Other drugs that reduce the seizure threshold. 
    Risk of seizure may also increase in patients with epilepsy, those with a history of seizures, or in patients with a recognized risk for seizure (such as head trauma, metabolic disorders, alcohol and drug withdrawal, CNS infections). In ULTRAM overdose, naloxone administration may increase the risk of seizure.
 

    Suicide Risk



    *  Do not prescribe ULTRAM for patients who are suicidal or addiction-prone. Consideration should be given to the use of non-narcotic analgesics in patients who are suicidal or depressed. (see   DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE   ). 
 *  Prescribe ULTRAM Tablets with caution for patients with a history of misuse and/or are currently taking CNS-active drugs including tranquilizers or antidepressant drugs, alcohol in excess, and patients who suffer from emotional disturbance or depression (see   PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions   ). 
 *  Inform patients not to exceed the recommended dose and to limit their intake of alcohol (see   DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION   ). 
       Adrenal Insufficiency
 

  Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.



    Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients



  The use of ULTRAM in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated.



  Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease:  ULTRAM-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of ULTRAM (see   WARNINGS    ).



  Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients:  Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients (see   WARNINGS    ).



 Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating ULTRAM and when ULTRAM is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration (see   WARNINGS    ). Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients.



    Severe Hypotension



  ULTRAM may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) (see   PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions    ). Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of ULTRAM. In patients with circulatory shock, ULTRAM may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of ULTRAM in patients with circulatory shock.



    Risks of use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness



  In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), ULTRAM may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with ULTRAM.



 Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of ULTRAM in patients with impaired consciousness or coma.



    Risks of use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions



  ULTRAM is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus (see   CONTRAINDICATIONS    ).



 The tramadol in ULTRAM may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsening symptoms.



    Anaphylaxis and Other Hypersensitivity Reactions



  Serious and rarely fatal anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with ULTRAM. When these events do occur it is often following the first dose. Other reported allergic reactions include pruritus, hives, bronchospasm, angioedema, toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Patients with a history of anaphylactoid reactions to tramadol and other opioids may be at increased risk and therefore should not receive ULTRAM (see   CONTRAINDICATIONS    ). If anaphylaxis or other hypersensitivity occurs, stop administration of ULTRAM immediately, discontinue ULTRAM permanently, and do not rechallenge with any formulation of tramadol. Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if they experience any symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction (see   CONTRAINDICATIONS  ,  PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients    ).



    Withdrawal



  Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g, pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including ULTRAM. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.



 When discontinuing ULTRAM in a physically-dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage (see   DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION    ). Do not abruptly discontinue ULTRAM in these patients (see   DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE    ).



    Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery



  ULTRAM may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of ULTRAM and know how they will react to the medication.
