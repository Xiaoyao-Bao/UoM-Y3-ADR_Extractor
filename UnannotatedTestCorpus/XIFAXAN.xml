  6.1 Clinical Studies Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



   Travelers' Diarrhea  



 The safety of XIFAXAN 200 mg taken three times a day was evaluated in patients with travelers' diarrhea consisting of 320 patients in two placebo-controlled clinical trials with 95% of patients receiving three or four days of treatment with XIFAXAN. The population studied had a mean age of 31.3 (18-79) years of which approximately 3% were &gt;=65 years old, 53% were male and 84% were White, 11% were Hispanic.



 Discontinuations due to adverse reactions occurred in 0.4% of patients. The adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were taste loss, dysentery, weight decrease, anorexia, nausea and nasal passage irritation.



 The adverse reaction that occurred at a frequency &gt;=2% in XIFAXAN-treated patients (n=320) at a higher rate than placebo (n=228) in the two placebo-controlled trials of TD was:



 *    headache (10% XIFAXAN, 9% placebo) 
      Hepatic Encephalopathy  
 

 The data described below reflect exposure to XIFAXAN in 348 patients, including 265 exposed for 6 months and 202 exposed for more than a year (mean exposure was 364 days). The safety of XIFAXAN 550 mg taken two times a day for reducing the risk of overt hepatic encephalopathy recurrence in adult patients was evaluated in a 6-month placebo-controlled clinical trial (n=140) and in a long term follow-up study (n=280). The population studied had a mean age of 56 (range: 21 to 82) years; approximately 20% of the patients were &gt;=65 years old, 61% were male, 86% were White, and 4% were Black. Ninety-one percent of patients in the trial were taking lactulose concomitantly. The most common adverse reactions that occurred at an incidence &gt;=5% and at a higher incidence in XIFAXAN-treated subjects than in the placebo group in the 6-month trial are provided in Table 1.

           Irritable Bowel Syndrome with Diarrhea  
 

 The safety of XIFAXAN for the treatment of IBS-D was evaluated in 3 placebo-controlled studies in which 952 patients were randomized to XIFAXAN 550 mg three times a day for 14 days. Across the 3 studies, 96% of patients received at least 14 days of treatment with XIFAXAN. In Trials 1 and 2, 624 patients received only one 14-day treatment. Trial 3 evaluated the safety of XIFAXAN in 328 patients who received 1 open-label treatment and 2 double-blind repeat treatments of 14 days each over a period of up to 46 weeks. The combined population studied had a mean age of 47 (range: 18 to 88) years of whom approximately 11% of the patients were  &gt;=  65 years old, 72% were female, 88% were White, 9% were Black and 12% were Hispanic.



 The adverse reaction that occurred at a frequency &gt;=2% in XIFAXAN-treated patients at a higher rate than placebo in Trials 1 and 2 for IBS-D was:



 *    nausea (3% XIFAXAN, 2% placebo) 
    The adverse reactions that occurred at a frequency &gt;=2% in XIFAXAN-treated patients (n=328) at a higher rate than placebo (n=308) in Trial 3 for IBS-D during the double-blind treatment phase were:
 

 *    ALT increased (XIFAXAN 2%, placebo 1%) 
 *    nausea (XIFAXAN 2%, placebo 1%) 
      Less Common Adverse Reactions  
 

 The following adverse reactions, presented by body system, were reported in less than 2% of patients in clinical trials of TD and IBS-D and in less than 5% of patients in clinical trials of HE:



   Hepatobiliary disorders:  Clostridium colitis



   Investigations:  Increased blood creatine phosphokinase



   Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders:  myalgia



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of XIFAXAN. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting or causal connection to XIFAXAN.



   Infections and Infestations  



 Cases of  C. difficile-  associated colitis have been reported  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )].  



   General  



 Hypersensitivity reactions, including exfoliative dermatitis, rash, angioneurotic edema (swelling of face and tongue and difficulty swallowing), urticaria, flushing, pruritus and anaphylaxis have been reported. These events occurred as early as within 15 minutes of drug administration.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *    Travelers' Diarrhea Not Caused by E. coli : XIFAXAN was not effective in diarrhea complicated by fever and/or blood in the stool or diarrhea due to pathogens other than E. coli . If diarrhea symptoms get worse or persist for more than 24 to 48 hours, discontinue XIFAXAN and consider alternative antibiotics (  5.1  ) 
 *     Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea: Evaluate if diarrhea occurs after therapy or does not improve or worsens during therapy (  5.2  ) 
 *    Hepatic Impairment: Use with caution in patients with severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment (  5.4  ,  8.7  ) 
 *    Concomitant P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine): Caution should be exercised when concomitant use of XIFAXAN and a P-glycoprotein inhibitor is needed (  5.5  ,  7.1  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Travelers' Diarrhea Not Caused by Escherichia coli  



  XIFAXAN was not found to be effective in patients with diarrhea complicated by fever and/or blood in the stool or diarrhea due to pathogens other than Escherichia coli.  



 Discontinue XIFAXAN if diarrhea symptoms get worse or persist more than 24 to 48 hours and alternative antibiotic therapy should be considered.



 XIFAXAN is not effective in cases of travelers' diarrhea due to Campylobacter jejuni.  The effectiveness of XIFAXAN in travelers' diarrhea caused by Shigella  spp. and Salmonella  spp. has not been proven. XIFAXAN should not be used in patients where Campylobacter jejuni, Shigella  spp., or Salmonella  spp. may be suspected as causative pathogens [see Indications and Usage (  1.1  )].  



    5.2 Clostridium difficile-  Associated Diarrhea



   Clostridium difficile-  associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including XIFAXAN, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon which may lead to overgrowth of C. difficile.  



  C. difficile  produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile  cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.



 If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile  may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile,  and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.



    5.3 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria



  Prescribing XIFAXAN for travelers' diarrhea in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.



    5.4 Severe (Child-Pugh Class C) Hepatic Impairment



  There is increased systemic exposure in patients with severe hepatic impairment. The clinical trials were limited to patients with MELD scores &lt;25. Therefore, caution should be exercised when administering XIFAXAN to patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.7  ), Clinical Studies (  14.2  )].  



    5.5 Concomitant Use with P-glycoprotein Inhibitors



  Concomitant administration of drugs that are P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors with XIFAXAN can substantially increase the systemic exposure to rifaximin. Caution should be exercised when concomitant use of XIFAXAN and a P-gp inhibitor such as cyclosporine is needed. In patients with hepatic impairment, a potential additive effect of reduced metabolism and concomitant P-gp inhibitors may further increase the systemic exposure to rifaximin [see Drug Interactions (  7.1  ), Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )].
