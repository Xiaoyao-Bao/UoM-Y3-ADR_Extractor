  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug (or a drug given in various combinations with other concomitant therapy) cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug (or drug given in the same or different combination therapy) and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials of FTC+TAF with EVG+COBI in Treatment-Naive Adults with HIV-1 Infection  



 In pooled 48-week trials of antiretroviral treatment-naive HIV-1 infected adult subjects, the most common adverse reaction in subjects treated with FTC+TAF with EVG+COBI (N=866) (incidence greater than or equal to 10%, all grades) was nausea (10%). In this treatment group, 0.9% of subjects discontinued FTC+TAF with EVG+COBI due to adverse events during the 48-week treatment period  [see  Clinical Studies (14)  ]  . The safety profile was similar in virologically-suppressed adults with HIV-1 infection who were switched to FTC+TAF with EVG+COBI (N=799). Antiretroviral treatment-naive adult subjects treated with FTC+TAF with EVG+COBI experienced mean increases of 30 mg/dL of total cholesterol, 15 mg/dL of LDL cholesterol, 7 mg/dL of HDL cholesterol and 29 mg/dL of triglycerides after 48 weeks of use.



     Renal Laboratory Tests  



 In two 48-week trials in antiretroviral treatment-naive HIV-1 infected adults treated with FTC+TAF with EVG+COBI (N=866) with a median baseline eGFR of 115 mL per minute, mean serum creatinine increased by 0.1 mg per dL from baseline to Week 48. Median urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) was 44 mg per gram at baseline and at Week 48. In a 48-week trial in virologically-suppressed TDF-treated adults who switched to FTC+TAF with EVG+COBI (N=959) with a mean baseline eGFR of 112 mL per minute, mean serum creatinine was similar to baseline and median UPCR was 61 mg per gram at baseline and 46 mg per gram at Week 48. In a 24-week trial in adults with renal impairment (baseline eGFR 30 to 69 mL per minute) who received FTC+TAF with EVG+COBI (N=248), mean serum creatinine was 1.5 mg per dL at both baseline and Week 24. Median UPCR was 161 mg per gram at baseline and 93 mg per gram at Week 24.



     Bone Mineral Density Effects  



 In the pooled analysis of two 48-week trials of antiretroviral treatment-naive HIV-1 infected adult subjects, bone mineral density (BMD) from baseline to Week 48 was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Mean BMD decreased from baseline to Week 48 -1.30% with FTC+TAF with EVG+COBI at the lumbar spine and -0.66% at the total hip. BMD declines of 5% or greater at the lumbar spine were experienced by 10% of FTC+TAF with EVG+COBI subjects. BMD declines of 7% or greater at the femoral neck were experienced by 7% of FTC+TAF with EVG+COBI subjects. The long-term clinical significance of these BMD changes is not known. Fractures (excluding fingers and toes) were reported in 7 (0.8%) subjects in the FTC+TAF with EVG+COBI group.



 In 799 virologically-suppressed TDF-treated adult subjects that switched to FTC+TAF with EVG+COBI, at Week 48 mean BMD increased (1.86% lumbar spine, 1.95% total hip). BMD declines of 5% or greater at the lumbar spine were experienced by 1% of FTC+TAF with EVG+COBI subjects. BMD declines of 7% or greater at the femoral neck were experienced by 1% of FTC+TAF with EVG+COBI subjects.



     Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials in Pediatric Subjects with HIV-1 Infection  



 In an open-label trial of antiretroviral treatment-naive HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects between the ages of 12 to less than 18 years weighing at least 35 kg through 48 weeks (N=50; cohort 1) and virologically-suppressed subjects between the ages of 6 to less than 12 years weighing at least 25 kg (N=23; cohort 2) who received FTC+TAF with EVG+COBI through 24 weeks, with the exception of a decrease in the mean CD4+ cell count observed in cohort 2, the safety of this combination was similar to that of adults.



     Bone Mineral Density Effects  



     Cohort 1: Treatment-naive adolescents (12 to less than 18 years; at least 35 kg)  



 Among the subjects in cohort 1 receiving FTC+TAF with EVG+COBI, mean BMD increased from baseline to Week 48, +4.2% at the lumbar spine and +1.3% for the total body less head (TBLH). Mean changes from baseline BMD Z-scores were -0.07 for lumbar spine and -0.20 for TBLH at Week 48. One subject had significant (at least 4%) lumbar spine BMD loss at Week 48.



     Cohort 2: Virologically-suppressed children (6 to less than 12 years; at least 25 kg)  



 Among the subjects in cohort 2 receiving FTC+TAF with EVG+COBI, mean BMD increased from baseline to Week 24, +2.9% at the lumbar spine and +1.7% for TBLH. Mean changes from baseline BMD Z-scores were -0.06 for lumbar spine and -0.18 for TBLH at Week 24. Two subjects had significant (at least 4%) lumbar spine BMD loss at Week 24.



     Change from Baseline in CD4+ cell counts  



     Cohort 2: Virologically-suppressed children (6 to less than 12 years; at least 25 kg)  



 Cohort 2 evaluated pediatric subjects (N=23) who were virologically-suppressed and who switched from their antiretroviral regimen to FTC+TAF with EVG+COBI. Although all subjects had HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL, there was a decrease from baseline in CD4+ cell count at Week 24. The mean baseline and mean change from baseline in CD4+ cell count and in CD4% from Week 2 to Week 24 are presented in Table 1. All subjects maintained their CD4+ cell counts above 400 cells/mm  3     [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.4)  ].

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: POST TREATMENT ACUTE EXACERBATION OF HEPATITIS B

    WARNING: POST TREATMENT ACUTE EXACERBATION OF HEPATITIS B  

    DESCOVY is not approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, and the safety and efficacy of DESCOVY have not been established in patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) and HBV. Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV and have discontinued products containing emtricitabine (FTC) and/or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), and may occur with discontinuation of DESCOVY.  



   Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV and discontinue DESCOVY. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  .  



   EXCERPT:   WARNING: POST TREATMENT ACUTE EXACERBATION OF HEPATITIS B



   See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.  



 *  DESCOVY is not approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV and have discontinued products containing emtricitabine (FTC) and/or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), and may occur with discontinuation of DESCOVY. Hepatic function should be monitored closely in these patients. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted. (5.1)

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Immune reconstitution syndrome: May necessitate further evaluation and treatment.(  5.2  ) 
 *  New onset or worsening renal impairment: Assess creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein in all patients before initiating DESCOVY therapy and monitor during therapy. Monitor serum phosphorus in patients with chronic kidney disease. (  5.3  ) 
 *  Lactic acidosis/severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: Discontinue treatment in patients who develop symptoms or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity. (  5.4  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Severe Acute Exacerbation of Hepatitis B in Patients Coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV



  Patients with HIV-1 should be tested for the presence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) before initiating antiretroviral therapy [see  Dosage and Administration (2.1)  ]  . DESCOVY is not approved for the treatment of chronic HBV infection, and the safety and efficacy of DESCOVY have not been established in patients coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV.



 Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B (e.g., liver decompensation and liver failure) have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV and have discontinued products containing FTC and/or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), and may occur with discontinuation of DESCOVY. Patients coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV who discontinue DESCOVY should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted, especially in patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, since post-treatment exacerbation of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation and liver failure.



    5.2 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome



  Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including FTC, a component of DESCOVY. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections [such as Mycobacterium avium  infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii  pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis], which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.



 Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.



    5.3 New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment



  Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia), has been reported with the use of tenofovir prodrugs in both animal toxicology studies and human trials. In clinical trials of FTC+TAF with cobicistat (COBI) plus elvitegravir (EVG), there have been no cases of Fanconi syndrome or Proximal Renal Tubulopathy (PRT). In clinical trials of FTC+TAF with EVG+COBI in treatment-naive subjects and in virally suppressed subjects switched to FTC+TAF with EVG+COBI with eGFRs greater than 50 mL per minute, renal serious adverse events or discontinuations due to renal adverse reactions were encountered in less than 1% of participants treated with FTC+TAF with EVG+COBI. In a study of virally suppressed subjects with baseline eGFRs between 30 and 69 mL per minute treated with FTC+TAF with EVG+COBI for a median duration of 43 weeks, FTC+TAF with EVG+COBI was permanently discontinued due to worsening renal function in two of 80 (3%) subjects with a baseline eGFR between 30 and 50 mL per minute [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . DESCOVY is not recommended in patients with estimated creatinine clearance below 30 mL per minute because data in this population are insufficient.



 Patients taking tenofovir prodrugs who have impaired renal function and those taking nephrotoxic agents including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are at increased risk of developing renal-related adverse reactions.



 Estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein should be assessed before initiating DESCOVY therapy and should be monitored during therapy in all patients. Serum phosphorus should be monitored in patients with chronic kidney disease because these patients are at greater risk of developing Fanconi syndrome on tenofovir prodrugs. Discontinue DESCOVY in patients who develop clinically significant decreases in renal function or evidence of Fanconi syndrome.



    5.4 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis



   Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs, including emtricitabine, a component of DESCOVY, and tenofovir DF, another prodrug of tenofovir, alone or in combination with other antiretrovirals. Treatment with DESCOVY should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations).
