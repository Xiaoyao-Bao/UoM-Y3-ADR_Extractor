  Precise frequency data are not available.



 Generlac Solution may produce gaseous distention with flatulence or belching and abdominal discomfort such as cramping in about 20% of patients.



 Excessive dosage can lead to diarrhea with potential complications such as loss of fluids, hypokalemia, and hypernatremia. Nausea and vomiting have been reported.



  



 To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Wockhardt USA, LLC, at 1-800-445-4290 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.

   General



  Since Generlac Solution contains galactose (less than 1.6 g/15 mL) and lactose (less than 1.2 g/15 mL), it should be used with caution in diabetics.



 In the overall management of portal-systemic encephalopathy, it should be recognized that there is serious underlying liver disease with complications such as electrolyte disturbance (e.g., hypokalemia) for which other specific therapy may be required.



 Infants receiving lactulose may develop hyponatremia and dehydration.



  



    Drug Interactions



  There have been conflicting reports about the concomitant use of neomycin and lactulose solution. Theoretically, the elimination of certain colonic bacteria by neomycin and possibly other anti-infective agents may interfere with the desired degradation of lactulose and thus prevent the acidification of colonic contents. Thus the status of the lactulose-treated patient should be closely monitored in the event of concomitant oral anti-infective therapy.



 Results of preliminary studies in humans and rats suggest that nonabsorbable antacids given concurrently with lactulose may inhibit the desired lactulose-induced drop in colonic pH. Therefore, a possible lack of desired effect of treatment should be taken into consideration before such drugs are given concomitantly with Generlac Solution.



 Other laxatives should not be used, especially during the initial phase of therapy for portalsystemic encephalopathy, because the loose stools resulting from their use may falsely suggest that adequate Generlac Solution dosage has been achieved.



  



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility



  There are no known human data on long-term potential for carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, or impairment of fertility.



 There are no known animal data on long-term potential for mutagenicity.



 Administration of lactulose solution in the diet of mice for 18 months in concentrations of 3 and 10 percent (v/w) did not produce any evidence of carcinogenicity.



 In studies of mice, rats, and rabbits, doses of lactulose solution up to 6 or 12 mL/kg/day produced no deleterious effects in breeding, conception, or parturition.



  



    Pregnancy



   Teratogenic Effects



   Pregnancy Category B



  Reproduction studies have been performed in mice, rats, and rabbits at doses up to 2 or 4 times the usual human oral dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to lactulose. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.



    Nursing Mothers



  It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Generlac Solution is administered to a nursing woman.



    Pediatric Use



  Very little information on the use of lactulose in pediatric patients has been recorded (see    DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION    ).

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings">    WARNINGS



  A theoretical hazard may exist for patients being treated with lactulose solution who may be required to undergo electrocautery procedures during proctoscopy or colonoscopy. Accumulation of H2gas in significant concentration in the presence of an electrical spark may result in an explosive reaction. Although this complication has not been reported with lactulose, patients on lactulose therapy undergoing such procedures should have a thorough bowel cleansing with a non-fermentable solution. Insufflation of CO2as an additional safeguard may be pursued but is considered to be a redundant measure.
