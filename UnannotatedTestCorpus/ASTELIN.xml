  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect rates observed in practice.



     Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis      

  Astelin Nasal Spray Two Sprays Per Nostril Twice Daily

  Adverse experience information for Astelin Nasal Spray is derived from six placebo- and active-controlled, 2-day to 8-week clinical trials which included 391 patients, 12 years of age and older, with seasonal allergic rhinitis who received Astelin Nasal Spray at a dose of 2 sprays per nostril twice daily. In placebo-controlled efficacy trials, the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions in patients receiving Astelin Nasal Spray and vehicle placebo was 2.2% and 2.8%, respectively.



 Table 1 contains adverse reactions that were reported with frequencies &gt;=2% in the Astelin Nasal Spray 2 sprays per nostril twice daily treatment group and more frequently than placebo.

           Astelin Nasal Spray One Spray Per Nostril Twice Daily
   Adverse experience information for Astelin Nasal Spray at a dose of one spray per nostril twice daily is derived from two placebo-controlled 2-week clinical studies which included 276 patients 12 years of age and older with seasonal allergic rhinitis. The incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions in patients receiving Astelin Nasal Spray and vehicle placebo was 0.0% and 0.8%, respectively. Bitter taste was reported in 8.3% of patients compared to none in the placebo group. Somnolence was reported in 0.4% of patients compared to none in the placebo group.



 A total of 176 patients 5 to 11 years of age were exposed to Astelin Nasal Spray at a dose of 1 spray each nostril twice daily in 3 placebo-controlled studies. In these studies, adverse reactions that occurred more frequently in patients treated with Astelin Nasal Spray than with placebo, and that were not represented in the adult adverse reactions table above include rhinitis/cold symptoms (17.0% vs. 9.5%), cough (11.4% vs. 8.3%), conjunctivitis (5.1% vs. 1.8%), and asthma (4.5% vs. 4.1%).

     Vasomotor Rhinitis      

  Adverse experience information for Astelin Nasal Spray is derived from two placebo-controlled clinical studies which included 216 patients 12 years and older with vasomotor rhinitis who received Astelin Nasal Spray at a dose of 2 sprays per nostril twice daily for up to 28 days. The incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions in patients receiving Astelin Nasal Spray and vehicle placebo was 2.8% and 2.9%, respectively.



 The following adverse reactions were reported with frequencies &gt;= 2% in the Astelin Nasal Spray treatment group and more frequently than placebo.

   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  During the post approval use of Astelin Nasal Spray, the following adverse reactions have been identified. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions reported include: anaphylaxis, application site irritation, atrial fibrillation, chest pain, confusion, dyspnea, facial edema, involuntary muscle contractions, nasal sores, palpitations, paresthesia, parosmia, pruritus, rash, disturbance or loss of sense of smell and/or taste, tolerance, urinary retention, vision abnormal and xerophthalmia.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *    Somnolence: Avoid engaging in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness such as driving or operating machinery when taking Astelin Nasal Spray. (  5.1  ) 
 *    Alcohol and other central nervous system (CNS) depressants: Avoid concurrent use with Astelin Nasal Spray because further decreased alertness and impairment of CNS performance may occur. (  5.1  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Somnolence in Activities Requiring Mental Alertness



  In clinical trials, the occurrence of somnolence has been reported in some patients taking Astelin Nasal Spray [ see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ]. Patients should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness and motor coordination such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle after administration of Astelin Nasal Spray. Concurrent use of Astelin Nasal Spray with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants should be avoided because additional reductions in alertness and additional impairment of central nervous system performance may occur [ see  Drug Interactions (7.1)    ].
