  During two randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled 12-week trials to evaluate the efficacy of REVIA as an adjunctive treatment of alcohol dependence, most patients tolerated REVIA well. In these studies, a total of 93 patients received REVIA at a dose of 50 mg once daily. Five of these patients discontinued REVIA because of nausea. No serious adverse events were reported during these two trials.



 While extensive clinical studies evaluating the use of REVIA in detoxified, formerly opioid-dependent individuals failed to identify any single, serious untoward risk of REVIA use, placebo-controlled studies employing up to fivefold higher doses of REVIA (up to 300 mg per day) than that recommended for use in opiate receptor blockade have shown that REVIA causes hepatocellular injury in a substantial proportion of patients exposed at higher doses (see  WARNINGS  and  PRECAUTIONS  ,  Laboratory Tests  ).



 Aside from this finding, and the risk of precipitated opioid withdrawal, available evidence does not incriminate REVIA, used at any dose, as a cause of any other serious adverse reaction for the patient who is "opioid-free." It is critical to recognize that REVIA can precipitate or exacerbate abstinence signs and symptoms in any individual who is not completely free of exogenous opioids.



 Patients with addictive disorders, especially opioid addiction, are at risk for multiple numerous adverse events and abnormal laboratory findings,  including liver function abnormalities  . Data from both controlled and observational studies suggest that these abnormalities, other than the dose-related hepatotoxicity described above, are not related to the use of REVIA.



 Among opioid-free individuals, REVIA administration at the recommended dose has not been associated with a predictable profile of serious adverse or untoward events. However, as mentioned above, among individuals using opioids, REVIA may cause serious withdrawal reactions (see  CONTRAINDICATIONS  ,  WARNINGS  ,  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  ).



   Reported Adverse Events

  REVIA  has not been shown to cause significant increases in complaints in placebo-controlled trials in patients known to be free of opioids for more than 7 to 10 days. Studies in alcoholic populations and in volunteers in clinical pharmacology studies have suggested that a small fraction of patients may experience an opioid withdrawal-like symptom complex consisting of tearfulness, mild nausea, abdominal cramps, restlessness, bone or joint pain, myalgia, and nasal symptoms. This may represent the unmasking of occult opioid use, or it may represent symptoms attributable to naltrexone. A number of alternative dosing patterns have been recommended to try to reduce the frequency of these complaints.



   Alcoholism

  In an open label safety study with approximately 570 individuals with alcoholism receiving REVIA, the following new-onset adverse reactions occurred in 2% or more of the patients: nausea (10%), headache (7%), dizziness (4%), nervousness (4%), fatigue (4%), insomnia (3%), vomiting (3%), anxiety (2%) and somnolence (2%).



 Depression, suicidal ideation, and suicidal attempts have been reported in all groups when comparing naltrexone, placebo, or controls undergoing treatment for alcoholism.



 RATE RANGES OF NEW ONSET EVENTS 
                              Naltrexone     Placebo      
  Depression                  0 to 15%       0 to 17%     
  Suicide Attempt/Ideation    0 to 1%        0 to 3%      
         Although no causal relationship with REVIA is suspected, physicians should be aware that treatment with REVIA does not reduce the risk of suicide in these patients (see  PRECAUTIONS)  .
 

   Opioid Addiction

  The following adverse reactions have been reported both at baseline and during the REVIA clinical trials in opioid addiction at an incidence rate of more than 10%:



 Difficulty sleeping, anxiety, nervousness, abdominal pain/cramps, nausea and/or vomiting, low energy, joint and muscle pain, and headache.



 The incidence was less than 10% for:



 Loss of appetite, diarrhea, constipation, increased thirst, increased energy, feeling down, irritability, dizziness, skin rash, delayed ejaculation, decreased potency, and chills.



 The following events occurred in less than 1% of subjects:



   Respiratory

  Nasal congestion, itching, rhinorrhea, sneezing, sore throat, excess mucus or phlegm, sinus trouble, heavy breathing, hoarseness, cough, shortness of breath.



   Cardiovascular

  Nose bleeds, phlebitis, edema, increased blood pressure, non-specific ECG changes, palpitations, tachycardia.



   Gastrointestinal

  Excessive gas, hemorrhoids, diarrhea, ulcer.



   Musculoskeletal

  Painful shoulders, legs or knees; tremors, twitching.



   Genitourinary

  Increased frequency of, or discomfort during, urination; increased or decreased sexual interest.



   Dermatologic

  Oily skin, pruritus, acne, athlete's foot, cold sores, alopecia.



   Psychiatric

  Depression, paranoia, fatigue, restlessness, confusion, disorientation, hallucinations, nightmares, bad dreams.



   Special senses

  Eyes blurred, burning, light sensitive, swollen, aching, strained; ears-"clogged," aching, tinnitus.



   General

  Increased appetite, weight loss, weight gain, yawning, somnolence, fever, dry mouth, head "pounding," inguinal pain, swollen glands, "side" pains, cold feet, "hot spells."



   Postmarketing Experience

  Data collected from postmarketing use of REVIA show that most events usually occur early in the course of drug therapy and are transient. It is not always possible to distinguish these occurrences from those signs and symptoms that may result from a withdrawal syndrome. Events that have been reported include anorexia, asthenia, chest pain, fatigue, headache, hot flushes, malaise, changes in blood pressure, agitation, dizziness, hyperkinesia, nausea, vomiting, tremor, abdominal pain, diarrhea, palpitations, myalgia, anxiety, confusion, euphoria, hallucinations, insomnia, nervousness, somnolence, abnormal thinking, dyspnea, rash, increased sweating, vision abnormalities and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.



 In some individuals the use of opioid antagonists has been associated with a change in baseline levels of some hypothalamic, pituitary, adrenal, or gonadal hormones. The clinical significance of such changes is not fully understood.



 Adverse events, including withdrawal symptoms and death, have been reported with the use of REVIA  in ultra rapid opiate detoxification programs. The cause of death in these cases is not known (see  WARNINGS  ).



   Laboratory Tests

  In a placebo controlled study in which REVIA was administered to obese subjects at a dose approximately five-fold that recommended for the blockade of opiate receptors (300 mg per day), 19% (5/26) of REVIA recipients and 0% (0/24) of placebo-treated patients developed elevations of serum transaminases (i.e., peak ALT values ranging from 121 to 532; or 3 to 19 times their baseline values) after three to eight weeks of treatment. The patients involved were generally clinically asymptomatic, and the transaminase levels of all patients on whom follow-up was obtained returned to (or toward) baseline values in a matter of weeks.



 Transaminase elevations were also observed in other placebo controlled studies in which exposure to REVIA at doses above the amount recommended for the treatment of alcoholism or opioid blockade consistently produced more numerous and more significant elevations of serum transaminases than did placebo. Transaminase elevations occurred in 3 of 9 patients with Alzheimer's Disease who received REVIA (at doses up to 300 mg/day) for 5 to 8 weeks in an open clinical trial.

   General



   When Reversal of REVIA Blockade is Required for Pain Management



  In an emergency situation in patients receiving fully blocking doses of REVIA, a suggested plan of management is regional analgesia, conscious sedation with a benzodiazepine, use of non-opioid analgesics or general anesthesia.



 In a situation requiring opioid analgesia, the amount of opioid required may be greater than usual, and the resulting respiratory depression may be deeper and more prolonged.



 A rapidly acting opioid analgesic which minimizes the duration of respiratory depression is preferred. The amount of analgesic administered should be titrated to the needs of the patient. Non-receptor mediated actions may occur and should be expected (e.g., facial swelling, itching, generalized erythema, or bronchoconstriction) presumably due to histamine release.



 Irrespective of the drug chosen to reverse REVIA  blockade, the patient should be monitored closely by appropriately trained personnel in a setting equipped and staffed for cardiopulmonary resuscitation.



    Special Risk Patients



   Renal Impairment



  REVIA and its primary metabolite are excreted primarily in the urine, and caution is recommended in administering the drug to patients with renal impairment.



    Hepatic Impairment



  An increase in naltrexone AUC of approximately 5- and 10-fold in patients with compensated and decompensated liver cirrhosis, respectively, compared with subjects with normal liver function has been reported. These data also suggest that alterations in naltrexone bioavailability are related to liver disease severity.



    Information for Patients



  It is recommended that the prescribing physician relate the following information to patients being treated with REVIA:



 You have been prescribed REVIA as part of the comprehensive treatment for your alcoholism or drug dependence. You should carry identification to alert medical personnel to the fact that you are taking REVIA. A REVIA medication card may be obtained from your physician and can be used for this purpose. Carrying the identification card should help to ensure that you can obtain adequate treatment in an emergency. If you require medical treatment, be sure to tell the treating physician that you are receiving REVIA therapy. You should take REVIA as directed by your physician.



 *    Advise patients that if they previously used opioids, they may be more sensitive to lower doses of opioids and at risk of accidental overdose should they use opioids after REVIA treatment is discontinued or temporarily interrupted. It is important that patients inform family members and the people closest to the patient of this increased sensitivity to opioids and the risk of overdose. 
 *    Advise patients that because REVIA can block the effects of opioids, patients will not perceive any effect if they attempt to self-administer heroin or any other opioid drug in small doses while on REVIA. Further, emphasize that administration of large doses of heroin or any other opioid to try to bypass the blockade and get high while on REVIA may lead to serious injury, coma, or death. 
 *    Patients on REVIA may not experience the expected effects from opioid-containing analgesic, antidiarrheal, or antitussive medications. 
 *    Patients should be off all opioids, including opioid-containing medicines, for a minimum of 7 to 10 days before starting REVIA in order to avoid precipitation of opioid withdrawal. Patients transitioning from buprenorphine or methadone may be vulnerable to precipitation of withdrawal symptoms for as long as two weeks. Ensure that patients understand that withdrawal precipitated by administration of an opioid antagonist may be severe enough to require hospitalization if they have not been opioid-free for an adequate period of time, and is different from the experience of spontaneous withdrawal that occurs with discontinuation of opioid in a dependent individual. Advise patients that they should not take REVIA if they have any symptoms of opioid withdrawal. Advise all patients, including those with alcohol dependence, that it is imperative to notify healthcare providers of any recent use of opioids or any history of opioid dependence before starting REVIA to avoid precipitation of opioid withdrawal. 
 *    Advise patients that REVIA may cause liver injury. Patients should immediately notify their physician if they develop symptoms and/or signs of liver disease. 
 *    Advise patients that they may experience depression while taking REVIA. It is important that patients inform family members and the people closest to the patient that they are taking REVIA and that they should call a doctor right away should they become depressed or experience symptoms of depression. 
 *    Advise patients that REVIA has been shown to be effective only when used as part of a treatment program that includes counseling and support. 
 *    Advise patients that dizziness may occur with REVIA treatment, and they should avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until they have determined how REVIA affects them. 
 *    *  1.  become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with REVIA. 
 *  2.  are breastfeeding. 
 *  3.  experience other unusual or significant side effects while on REVIA therapy. 
   Advise patients to notify their physician if they: 
       Laboratory Tests
 

  REVIA does not interfere with thin-layer, gas-liquid, and high pressure liquid chromatographic methods which may be used for the separation and detection of morphine, methadone or quinine in the urine. REVIA may or may not interfere with enzymatic methods for the detection of opioids depending on the specificity of the test. Please consult the test manufacturer for specific details.



    Drug Interactions



  Studies to evaluate possible interactions between REVIA and drugs other than opiates have not been performed. Consequently, caution is advised if the concomitant administration of REVIA  and other drugs is required.



 The safety and efficacy of concomitant use of REVIA and disulfiram is unknown, and the concomitant use of two potentially hepatotoxic medications is not ordinarily recommended unless the probable benefits outweigh the known risks.



 Lethargy and somnolence have been reported following doses of REVIA and thioridazine.



 Patients taking REVIA may not benefit from opioid containing medicines, such as cough and cold preparations, antidiarrheal preparations, and opioid analgesics. In an emergency situation when opioid analgesia must be administered to a patient receiving REVIA, the amount of opioid required may be greater than usual, and the resulting respiratory depression may be deeper and more prolonged (see  PRECAUTIONS  ).



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility



  The following statements are based on the results of experiments in mice and rats. The potential carcinogenic, mutagenic and fertility effects of the metabolite 6-beta-naltrexol are unknown.



 In a two-year carcinogenicity study in rats, there were small increases in the numbers of testicular mesotheliomas in males and tumors of vascular origin in males and females. The incidence of mesothelioma in males given naltrexone at a dietary dose of 100 mg/kg/day (600 mg/m  2  /day; 16 times the recommended therapeutic dose, based on body surface area) was 6%, compared with a maximum historical incidence of 4%. The incidence of vascular tumors in males and females given dietary doses of 100 mg/kg/day (600 mg/m  2  /day) was 4%, but only the incidence in females was increased compared with a maximum historical control incidence of 2%. There was no evidence of carcinogenicity in a two-year dietary study with naltrexone in male and female mice.



 There was limited evidence of a weak genotoxic effect of naltrexone in one gene mutation assay in a mammalian cell line, in the Drosophila  recessive lethal assay, and in non-specific DNA repair tests with E. coli  . However, no evidence of genotoxic potential was observed in a range of other in vitro  tests, including assays for gene mutation in bacteria, yeast, or in a second mammalian cell line, a chromosomal aberration assay, and an assay for DNA damage in human cells. Naltrexone did not exhibit clastogenicity in an in vivo  mouse micronucleus assay.



 Naltrexone (100 mg/kg/day [600 mg/m  2  /day] PO; 16 times the recommended therapeutic dose, based on body surface area) caused a significant increase in pseudopregnancy in the rat. A decrease in the pregnancy rate of mated female rats also occurred. There was no effect on male fertility at this dose level. The relevance of these observations to human fertility is not known.



    Pregnancy



   Teratogenic Effects



   Category C



  Naltrexone has been shown to increase the incidence of early fetal loss when given to rats at doses &gt;= 30 mg/kg/day (180 mg/m  2  /day; 5 times the recommended therapeutic dose, based on body surface area) and to rabbits at oral doses &gt;= 60 mg/kg/day (720 mg/m  2  /day; 18 times the recommended therapeutic dose, based on body surface area). There was no evidence of teratogenicity when naltrexone was administered orally to rats and rabbits during the period of major organogenesis at doses up to 200 mg/kg/day (32 and 65 times the recommended therapeutic dose, respectively, based on body surface area).



 Rats do not form appreciable quantities of the major human metabolite, 6-beta-naltrexol; therefore, the potential reproductive toxicity of the metabolite in rats is not known.



 There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. REVIA should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.



    Labor and Delivery



  Whether or not REVIA affects the duration of labor and delivery is unknown.



    Nursing Mothers



  In animal studies, naltrexone and 6-beta-naltrexol were excreted in the milk of lactating rats dosed orally with naltrexone. Whether or not REVIA is excreted in human milk is unknown. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when REVIA is administered to a nursing woman.



    Pediatric Use



  The safe use of REVIA in pediatric patients younger than 18 years old has not been established.

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings">    WARNINGS



   Vulnerability to Opioid Overdose



  After opioid detoxification, patients are likely to have reduced tolerance to opioids. As the blockade of exogenous opioids provided by REVIA wanes and eventually dissipates completely, patients who have been treated with REVIA may respond to lower doses of opioids than previously used, just as they would shortly after completing detoxification. This could result in potentially life-threatening opioid intoxication (respiratory compromise or arrest, circulatory collapse, etc.) if the patient uses previously tolerated doses of opioids. Cases of opioid overdose with fatal outcomes have been reported in patients after discontinuing treatment.



 Patients should be alerted that they may be more sensitive to opioids, even at lower doses, after REVIA treatment is discontinued. It is important that patients inform family members, and the people closest to the patient of this increased sensitivity to opioids and the risk of overdose (see  PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients  ).



 There is also the possibility that a patient who is treated with REVIA could overcome the opioid blockade effect of REVIA. Although REVIA is a potent antagonist, the blockade produced by REVIA is surmountable. The plasma concentration of exogenous opioids attained immediately following their acute administration may be sufficient to overcome the competitive receptor blockade. This poses a potential risk to individuals who attempt, on their own, to overcome the blockade by administering large amounts of exogenous opioids. Any attempt by a patient to overcome the antagonism by taking opioids is especially dangerous and may lead to life-threatening opioid intoxication or fatal overdose. Patients should be told of the serious consequences of trying to overcome the opioid blockade (see  PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients  ).



    Precipitated Opioid Withdrawal



  The symptoms of spontaneous opioid withdrawal (which are associated with the discontinuation of opioid in a dependent individual) are uncomfortable, but they are not generally believed to be severe or necessitate hospitalization. However, when withdrawal is precipitated abruptly by the administration of an opioid antagonist to an opioid-dependent patient, the resulting withdrawal syndrome can be severe enough to require hospitalization. Symptoms of withdrawal have usually appeared within five minutes of ingestion of REVIA and have lasted for up to 48 hours. Mental status changes including confusion, somnolence and visual hallucinations have occurred. Significant fluid losses from vomiting and diarrhea have required intravenous fluid administration. Review of postmarketing cases of precipitated opioid withdrawal in association with naltrexone treatment has identified cases with symptoms of withdrawal severe enough to require hospital admission, and in some cases, management in the intensive care unit.



 To prevent occurrence of precipitated withdrawal in patients dependent on opioids, or exacerbation of a pre-existing subclinical withdrawal syndrome, opioid-dependent patients, including those being treated for alcohol dependence, should be opioid-free (including tramadol) before starting REVIA treatment. An opioid-free interval of a minimum of 7 to 10 days is recommended for patients previously dependent on short-acting opioids. Patients transitioning from buprenorphine or methadone may be vulnerable to precipitation of withdrawal symptoms for as long as two weeks.



 If a more rapid transition from agonist to antagonist therapy is deemed necessary and appropriate by the healthcare provider, monitor the patient closely in an appropriate medical setting where precipitated withdrawal can be managed.



 In every case, healthcare providers should always be prepared to manage withdrawal symptomatically with non-opioid medications because there is no completely reliable method for determining whether a patient has had an adequate opioid-free period. A naloxone challenge test may be helpful; however, a few case reports have indicated that patients may experience precipitated withdrawal despite having a negative urine toxicology screen or tolerating a naloxone challenge test (usually in the setting of transitioning from buprenorphine treatment). Patients should be made aware of the risks associated with precipitated withdrawal and encouraged to give an accurate account of last opioid use. Patients treated for alcohol dependence with REVIA should also be assessed for underlying opioid dependence and for any recent use of opioids prior to initiation of treatment with REVIA. Precipitated opioid withdrawal has been observed in alcohol-dependent patients in circumstances where the prescriber had been unaware of the additional use of opioids or co-dependence on opioids.



    Hepatotoxicity



  Cases of hepatitis and clinically significant liver dysfunction were observed in association with REVIA exposure during the clinical development program and in the postmarketing period. Transient, asymptomatic hepatic transaminase elevations were also observed in the clinical trials and postmarketing period. When patients presented with elevated transaminases, there were often other potential causative or contributory etiologies identified, including pre-existing alcoholic liver disease, hepatitis B and/or C infection, and concomitant usage of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs. Although clinically significant liver dysfunction is not typically recognized as a manifestation of opioid withdrawal, opioid withdrawal that is precipitated abruptly may lead to systemic sequelae, including acute liver injury.



 Patients should be warned of the risk of hepatic injury and advised to seek medical attention if they experience symptoms of acute hepatitis. Use of REVIA should be discontinued in the event of symptoms and/or signs of acute hepatitis.



    Depression and Suicidality



  Depression, suicide, attempted suicide and suicidal ideation have been reported in the postmarketing experience with REVIA (naltrexone hydrochloride) used in the treatment of opioid dependence. No causal relationship has been demonstrated. In the literature, endogenous opioids have been theorized to contribute to a variety of conditions.



 Alcohol- and opioid-dependent patients, including those taking REVIA, should be monitored for the development of depression or suicidal thinking. Families and caregivers of patients being treated with REVIA should be alerted to the need to monitor patients for the emergence of symptoms of depression or suicidality, and to report such symptoms to the patient's healthcare provider.



    Ultra Rapid Opioid Withdrawal



  Safe use of REVIA  in ultra rapid opiate detoxification programs has not been established (see  ADVERSE REACTIONS  ).
