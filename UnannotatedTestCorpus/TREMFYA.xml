  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 In clinical trials, a total of 1748 subjects with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis received TREMFYA. Of these, 1393 subjects were exposed to TREMFYA for at least 6 months and 728 subjects were exposed for at least 1 year.



 Data from two placebo- and active-controlled trials (VOYAGE 1 and VOYAGE 2) in 1441 subjects (mean age 44 years; 70% males; 82% white) were pooled to evaluate the safety of TREMFYA (100 mg administered subcutaneously at Weeks 0 and 4, followed by every 8 weeks).



     Weeks 0 to 16  



 In the 16-week placebo-controlled period of the pooled clinical trials (VOYAGE 1 and VOYAGE 2), adverse events occurred in 49% of subjects in the TREMFYA group compared to 47% of subjects in the placebo group and 49% of subjects in the U.S. licensed adalimumab group. Serious adverse events occurred in 1.9% of the TREMFYA group (6.3 events per 100 subject-years of follow-up) compared to 1.4% of the placebo group (4.7 events per 100 subject-years of follow-up), and in 2.6% of U.S. licensed adalimumab group (9.9 events per 100 subject-years of follow-up).



 Table 1 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 1% and at a higher rate in the TREMFYA group than in the placebo group during the 16-week placebo-controlled period.

     Specific Adverse Reactions  



     Infections  



 Infections occurred in 23% of the TREMFYA group compared to 21% of the placebo group.



 The most common (&gt;= 1%) infections were upper respiratory infections, gastroenteritis, tinea infections, and herpes simplex infections; all cases were mild to moderate in severity and did not lead to discontinuation of TREMFYA.



     Elevated Liver Enzymes  



 Elevated liver enzymes were reported more frequently in the TREMFYA group (2.6%) than in the placebo group (1.9%). Of the 21 subjects who were reported to have elevated liver enzymes in the TREMFYA group, all events except one were mild to moderate in severity and none of the events led to discontinuation of TREMFYA.



     Safety through Week 48  



 Through Week 48, no new adverse reactions were identified with TREMFYA use and the frequency of the adverse reactions was similar to the safety profile observed during the first 16 weeks of treatment.



   6.2 Immunogenicity

  As with all therapeutic proteins, there is the potential for immunogenicity with TREMFYA. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of incidence of antibodies to guselkumab with the incidences of antibodies to other products may be misleading.



 Up to Week 52, approximately 6% of subjects treated with TREMFYA developed antidrug antibodies. Of the subjects who developed antidrug antibodies, approximately 7% had antibodies that were classified as neutralizing antibodies. Among the 46 subjects who developed antibodies to guselkumab and had evaluable data, 21 subjects exhibited lower trough levels of guselkumab, including one subject who experienced loss of efficacy after developing high antibody titers. However, antibodies to guselkumab were generally not associated with changes in clinical response or development of injection-site reactions.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Infections: TREMFYA may increase the risk of infection. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms of clinically important chronic or acute infection occur. If a serious infection develops, discontinue TREMFYA until the infection resolves. (  5.1  ) 
 *  Tuberculosis (TB): Evaluate for TB prior to initiating treatment with TREMFYA. (  5.2  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Infections



  TREMFYA may increase the risk of infection. In clinical trials, infections occurred in 23% of subjects in the TREMFYA group versus 21% of subjects in the placebo group through 16 weeks of treatment. Upper respiratory tract infections, gastroenteritis, tinea infections, and herpes simplex infections occurred more frequently in the TREMFYA group than in the placebo group [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . The rate of serious infections for the TREMFYA group and the placebo group was &lt;= 0.2%. Treatment with TREMFYA should not be initiated in patients with any clinically important active infection until the infection resolves or is adequately treated.



 In patients with a chronic infection or a history of recurrent infection, consider the risks and benefits prior to prescribing TREMFYA. Instruct patients to seek medical help if signs or symptoms of clinically important chronic or acute infection occur. If a patient develops a clinically important or serious infection or is not responding to standard therapy, monitor the patient closely and discontinue TREMFYA until the infection resolves.



    5.2 Pre-treatment Evaluation for Tuberculosis



  Evaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating treatment with TREMFYA. Initiate treatment of latent TB prior to administering TREMFYA. In clinical studies, 105 subjects with latent TB who were concurrently treated with TREMFYA and appropriate TB prophylaxis did not develop active TB (during the mean follow-up of 43 weeks). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of active TB during and after TREMFYA treatment. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiating TREMFYA in patients with a past history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed. Do not administer TREMFYA to patients with active TB infection.



    5.3 Immunizations



  Prior to initiating therapy with TREMFYA, consider completion of all age appropriate immunizations according to current immunization guidelines. Avoid use of live vaccines in patients treated with TREMFYA. No data are available on the response to live or inactive vaccines.
