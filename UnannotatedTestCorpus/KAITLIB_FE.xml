      6.1 Clinical Trial Experience
   Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 A phase 3 clinical trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of Kaitlib Fe for pregnancy prevention. The study was a multicenter, non-comparative, open-label study with a treatment duration of 12 months (thirteen 28-day cycles). A total of 1,677 women aged 18 to 46 were enrolled and took at least one dose of Kaitlib Fe.



     Adverse         Reactions         Leading         to         Study         Discontinuation    



 8.5% of the women discontinued from the clinical trial due to an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were nausea (1.0%), weight increase (0.8%), acne (0.8%), metrorrhagia (0.7%), altered mood (0.4%), hypertension (0.4%), irritability (0.3%), migraine (0.3%), decreased libido (0.3%) and mood swings (0.3%).



     Common         Adverse         Reactions         (&gt;=         2%         of         all         treated         subjects)    



 Nausea/vomiting (8.8%), headaches/migraine (7.5%), depression/mood complaints (4.1%), dysmenorrhea (3.9%), acne (3.2%), anxiety symptoms (2.4%), breast pain/tenderness (2.4%), and increased weight (2.3%).

  FDA-APPROVED PATIENT LABELING

    Guide for Using Kaitlib  TM   Fe  



   [KATE-lib EFF EE]  



   (norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol chewable tablets and ferrous fumarate chewable tablets)  



     WARNING     TO     WOMEN     WHO     SMOKE  



   Do     not     use     Kaitlib     Fe     if     you     smoke     cigarettes     and     are     over     35     years     old.     Smoking     increases     your     risk     of     serious     cardiovascular     side     effects     (heart     and     blood     vessel     problems)     from     birth     control     pills  ,   including     death     from     heart     attack  ,   blood     clots     or     stroke.     This     risk     increases     with     age     and     the     number     of     cigarettes     you     smoke.  



   Birth control pills help to lower the chances of becoming pregnant when taken as directed. They do not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases.



   What     is     Kaitlib     Fe?  



 Kaitlib Fe is birth control pill. It contains two female hormones, an estrogen called ethinyl estradiol and a progestin called norethindrone.



   How     Well     Does     Kaitlib     Fe     Work?  



 Your chance of getting pregnant depends on how well you follow the directions for taking your birth control pills. The more carefully you follow the directions, the less chance you have of getting pregnant.



 Based on the results of one clinical study, 1 to 3 women out of 100 women may get pregnant during the first year they use Kaitlib Fe.



 The following chart shows the chance of getting pregnant for women who use different methods of birth control. Each box on the chart contains a list of birth control methods that are similar in effectiveness. The most effective methods are at the top of the chart. The box on the bottom of the chart shows the chance of getting pregnant for women who do not use birth control and are trying to get pregnant.



   How     Do     I     Take     Kaitlib     Fe?  



 *  Chew and swallow one pill every day without water at the same time. Take the pills in the order directed on the wallet. 
 *  Do not skip pills or take at intervals exceeding 24 hours. If you miss pills (including starting the pack late), you could get pregnant. The more pills you miss, the more likely you are to get pregnant. 
 *  If you have trouble remembering to take Kaitlib Fe, talk to your healthcare provider about how to make pill-taking easier or about using another method of birth control. 
 *  You may have spotting or light bleeding when you first take Kaitlib Fe. Spotting or light bleeding is normal at first. 
 *  You may feel sick to your stomach (nauseated), especially during the first few months that you take Kaitlib Fe. If you feel sick to your stomach, do not stop taking the pill. The problem will usually go away. If your nausea doesn't go away, call your healthcare provider. 
 *  If you vomit or have diarrhea within 3 to 4 hours of taking your pill, follow the instructions for "What Should I Do if I Miss any Pills." 
 *  Missing pills can also cause spotting or light bleeding, even when you take the missed pills late. On the days you take 2 pills to make up for missed pills, you could also feel a little sick to your stomach. 
      Before     you     start     taking     Kaitlib     Fe  
 

 *  Decide what time of day to take your pill. It is important to take it at the same time every day and in the order as directed on the wallet. 
   *  Look at your Kaitlib Fe wallet. The wallet has four rows of 7 pills each, for a total of 28 pills. Find: 
        o    where on the pack to start taking your pills
 

     o    in what order to take the pills



 Each Kaitlib Fe wallet has 28 pills



     o    24 light green pills with hormones for Weeks 1, 2 and 3 and the first part of Week 4



     o    4 brown pills without hormones for the remainder of Week 4



 *  Be sure to have ready at all times another kind of birth control (such as condoms or spermicides) to use as a back-up in case you miss pills. 
      When     to     Start     Kaitlib     Fe  
 

   If     you     start     taking     Kaitlib     Fe     and     you     did     not     use     a     hormonal     birth     control     method     before:  



   DAY-1     START:  



 *  Pick the day label strip that starts with the first day of your period (this is the day you start bleeding or spotting, even if it is almost midnight when the bleeding begins). Pick a time of day that will be easy to remember. 
 *  Place this day label strip on the wallet over the area that has the days of the week (starting with Sunday) printed on the wallet. 
 *  Take the first light green pill of the first pack during the first 24 hours of your period. 
 *  You will not need to use a back-up method of birth control because you are starting the pill at the beginning of your period. However, if you start on a day other than the first day of your period or if you are starting after having been pregnant and have not yet had a period, use a back-up method of birth control such as a condom or spermicide until you have taken a light green pill for 7 days in a row. 
 *  After taking the last brown pill (day 28) of the wallet, start taking the first light green pill from a new wallet the very next day whether or not you are having your period. 
      If     you     start     taking     Kaitlib     Fe     and     you     are     switching     from     a     combination     hormonal     method     such     as:  
 

     o    another pill



     o    vaginal ring



     o    patch



 *  Take the first light green pill on the first day you would have started your previous birth control pack. 
 *  If you previously used a vaginal ring or transdermal patch, finish the 21 days of use and wait 7 days after removal of the ring or transdermal patch before starting Kaitlib Fe. 
 *  Use a non-hormonal back-up method such as a condom and spermicide for the first 7 days you take Kaitlib Fe. 
      If     you     start     taking     Kaitlib     Fe     and     you     are     switching     from     a     progestin-only     method     such     as a:  
 

     o    progestin-only pill



     o    implant



     o    intrauterine system



     o    injection



 *  Take the first light green pill on the day you would have taken your next progestin-only pill or on the day of removal of your implant or intrauterine system or on the day when you would have had your next injection. 
 *  Use a non-hormonal back-up method such as a condom and spermicide for the first 7 days you take Kaitlib Fe. 
      What     Should     I     do     if     I     Miss     any     Pills  
 

 If you forgot to start a new wallet,   you may already be pregnant  . Use back-up contraception (such as a condom and spermicide) anytime you have sex. Call your healthcare provider if you are unsure whether you are pregnant.



 Your birth control pills may not be as effective if you miss any light green pills, and particularly if you miss the first few or the last few light green pills in a pack.



   If     you     MISS     ONE     light     green     pill  



 *  Take it as soon as you remember. Take the next pill at your regular time. This means you may take two pills in 1 day. 
 *  You do not need to use a back-up birth control method if you have sex. 
      If     you     MISS     TWO     light     green     pills     in     a     row     in     WEEK     1     or     WEEK     2     of     your     pack  
 

 *  Take two pills on the day you remember and two pills the next day. 
 *  Then take one pill a day until you finish the pack. 
 *  You could become pregnant if you have sex during the 7 days after you restart your pills. You MUST use a non-hormonal birth control method (such as a condom and spermicide) as a back-up for those 7 days. 
      If     you     MISS     TWO     light     green     pills     in     a     row     in     WEEK     3     or     WEEK     4     of     your     pack  
 

 *  THROW OUT the rest of the pill pack and start a new pack that same day. 
 *  You could become pregnant if you have sex during the 7 days after you restart your pills. You MUST use a non-hormonal birth control method (such as a condom and spermicide) as a back-up for those 7 days after you restart your pills. 
      If     you     MISS     THREE     OR     MORE     light     green     pills     in     a     row     at     any     time  
 

 *  THROW OUT the rest of the pill pack and start a new pack that same day. 
 *  You could become pregnant if you have sex on the days when you missed pills or during the first 7 days after restarting your pills. You MUST use a non-hormonal birth control method (such as a condoms and spermicide) as a back-up the next time you have sex and for the first 7 days after you restart your pills. 
      If     you     forget     any     of     the     four     brown     "reminder"     pills     in     WEEK     4  
 

 *  THROW AWAY the pills you missed. 
 *  Keep taking one pill each day until the pack is finished. 
 *  You do not need to use a back-up method of birth control. 
        You may already be pregnant or COULD BECOME PREGNANT if you had sex on the days after the pills were missed. The more pills missed and the closer they are to the end of the cycle, the higher the risk of a pregnancy. You should call your doctor or healthcare provider if you are unsure whether you are already pregnant.  
 

     If     you     are     still     not     sure     of     what     to     do     about     the     pills     you     have     missed:  



 *  Call your healthcare provider 
 *  Use a back-up contraception (such as condoms and spermicides) anytime you have sex and keep taking 1 pill each day 
      Who     Should     not     Take     Kaitlib     Fe?  
 

 Your healthcare provider will not give you Kaitlib Fe if you have:



 *  Ever had breast cancer or any cancer that is sensitive to female hormones 
 *  Liver disease, including liver tumors 
 *  Ever had blood clots in your arms, legs, or lungs 
 *  Ever had a stroke 
 *  Ever had a heart attack 
 *  Certain heart valve problems or heart rhythm abnormalities that can cause blood clots to form in the heart 
 *  An inherited problem with your blood that makes it clot more than normal 
 *  High blood pressure that medicine can't control 
 *  Diabetes with kidney, eye, or blood vessel damage 
 *  Certain kinds of severe migraine headaches with aura, numbness, weakness or changes in vision 
    Also, do not take birth control pills if you:
 

 *  Smoke and are over 35 years old 
 *  Are pregnant 
    Birth control pills may not be a good choice for you if you have ever had jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes) caused by pregnancy (also called cholestasis of pregnancy).
 

   What     Else     Should     I     Know     about     Taking     Kaitlib     Fe?  



 Birth control pills do not protect you against any sexually transmitted disease, including HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.



 Do not skip any pills, even if you do not have sex often.



 If you miss a period, you could be pregnant. However, some women miss periods or have light periods on birth control pills, even when they are not pregnant. Contact your healthcare provider for advice if you:



 *  Think you are pregnant 
 *  Miss one period and have not taken your birth control pills according to directions 
 *  Miss two periods in a row 
    Birth control pills should not be taken during pregnancy. However, birth control pills taken by accident during pregnancy are not known to cause birth defects.
 

 You should stop Kaitlib Fe at least four weeks before you have major surgery and not restart it until at least two weeks after the surgery due to an increased risk of blood clots.



 If you are breastfeeding, consider another birth control method until you are ready to stop breastfeeding. Birth control pills that contain estrogen, like Kaitlib Fe, may decrease the amount of milk you make. A small amount of the pill's hormones pass into breast milk.



 Tell your healthcare provider about all medicines and herbal products that you take. Some medicines and herbal products may make birth control pills less effective, including:



 *  Barbiturates 
 *  Bosentan 
 *  Carbemazepine 
 *  Felbamate 
 *  Griseofulvin 
 *  Oxcarbazepine 
 *  Phenytoin 
 *  Rifampin 
 *  St. John's wort 
 *  Topiramate 
    Consider using another birth control method when you take medicines that may make birth control pills less effective.
 

 Birth control pills may interact with lamotrigine, an anticonvulsant used for epilepsy. This may increase the risk of seizures, so your healthcare provider may need to adjust the dose of lamotrigine.



 If you have vomiting or diarrhea, your birth control pills may not work as well. Use another birth control method, like a condom and spermicide, until you check with your healthcare provider.



   What     are     the     Most     Serious     Risks     of     Taking     Birth     Control     Pills?  



 Like pregnancy, birth control pills increase the risk of serious blood clots, especially in women who have other risk factors, such as smoking, obesity, or age greater than 35. It is possible to die from a problem caused by a blood clot, such as a heart attack or a stroke. Some examples of serious blood clots are blood clots in the:



 *  Legs (thrombophlebitis) 
 *  Lungs (pulmonary embolus) 
 *  Eyes (loss of eyesight) 
 *  Heart (heart attack) 
 *  Brain (stroke) 
    A few women who take birth control pills may get:
 

 *  High blood pressure 
 *  Gallbladder problems 
 *  Rare cancerous or noncancerous liver tumors 
    All of these events are uncommon in healthy women.
 

   Call     your     healthcare     provider     right     away     if     you     have:  



 *  Persistent leg pain 
 *  Sudden shortness of breath 
 *  Sudden blindness, partial or complete 
 *  Severe pain in your chest 
 *  Sudden, severe headache unlike your usual headaches 
 *  Weakness or numbness in an arm or leg, or trouble speaking 
 *  Yellowing of the skin or eyeballs 
      What     are     the     Common     Side     Effects     of     Birth     Control     Pills?  
 

 The most common side effects of birth control pills are:



 *  Spotting or bleeding between menstrual periods 
 *  Nausea 
 *  Breast tenderness 
 *  Headache 
    These side effects are usually mild and usually disappear with time. 
 

 Less common side effects are:



 *  Acne 
 *  Less sexual desire 
 *  Bloating or fluid retention 
 *  Blotchy darkening of the skin, especially on the face 
 *  High blood sugar, especially in women who already have diabetes 
 *  High fat levels in the blood 
 *  Depression, especially if you have had depression in the past. Call your healthcare provider immediately if you have any thoughts of harming yourself. 
 *  Problems tolerating contact lenses 
 *  Weight changes 
    This is not a complete list of possible side effects. Talk to your healthcare provider if you develop any side effects that concern you. You may report side effects to the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.
 

 You may also report side effects to Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-800-399-2561 or you can visit the Lupin website at www.lupinpharmaceuticals.com



 No serious problems have been reported from a birth control pill overdose, even when accidentally taken by children.



   Do     Birth     Control     Pills     Cause     Cancer?  



 Birth control pills do not seem to cause breast cancer. However, if you have breast cancer now, or have had it in the past, do not use birth control pills because some breast cancers are sensitive to hormones.



 Women who use birth control pills may have a slightly higher chance of getting cervical cancer. However, this may be due to other reasons such as having more sexual partners.



   What     Should     I     Know     about     My     Period     when     Taking     Kaitlib     Fe?  



 Unscheduled (irregular) vaginal bleeding or spotting may occur while you are taking Kaitlib Fe. Unscheduled bleeding may vary from slight staining to breakthrough bleeding, which is a flow much like a regular period, but which occurs between menstrual periods. Unscheduled bleeding occurs most often during the first few months of oral contraceptive use, but may also occur after you have been taking the pill for some time. Such bleeding may be temporary and usually does not indicate any serious problems.



 Approximately one-third of the women who use Kaitlib Fe have unscheduled bleeding or spotting in the first months of use. About one-quarter of users continue to have unscheduled bleeding or spotting after one year of use.



 It is important to continue taking your pills on schedule. If the bleeding occurs in more than one cycle, is unusually heavy, or lasts for more than a few days, call your healthcare provider.



   What     if     I     Miss     My     Scheduled     Period     when     Taking     Kaitlib     Fe?  



 Women who use Kaitlib Fe may not have a period at the end of every 28-day pack of pills.



 If you miss more than two periods in a row or miss one period when you have not taken your birth control pills according to directions, call your healthcare provider. Also notify your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of pregnancy such as morning sickness or unusual breast tenderness. It is important that your healthcare provider checks you to find out if you are pregnant. Stop taking Kaitlib Fe if you are pregnant.



   What     If     I     Want     to     Become     Pregnant?  



 You may stop taking the pill whenever you wish. Consider a visit with your healthcare provider for a pre-pregnancy checkup before you stop taking the pill.



   General     Advice     about     Kaitlib     Fe  



 Your healthcare provider prescribed Kaitlib Fe for you. Please do not share Kaitlib Fe with anyone else. Keep Kaitlib Fe out of the reach of children.



 If you have concerns or questions, ask your healthcare provider. You may also ask your healthcare provider for a more detailed label written for medical professionals.

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Vascular risks: Stop Kaitlib Fe if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery in women who are not breastfeeding.(  5.1  ) 
 *  Liver disease: Discontinue if jaundice occurs. (  5.3  ) 
 *  High blood pressure: Do not prescribe for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease. (  5.4  ) 
 *  Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking Kaitlib Fe. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (  5.6  ) 
 *  Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue if indicated. (  5.7  ) 
 *  Uterine bleeding: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (  5.8  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Thrombotic and Other Vascular Events



  Stop Kaitlib Fe if an arterial or deep venous thrombotic (VTE) event occurs. Although the use of COCs increases the risk of venous thromboembolism, pregnancy increases the risk of venous thromboembolism as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of venous thromboembolism in women using COCs is 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The excess risk is highest during the first year of use of a COC. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued.



 If feasible, stop Kaitlib Fe at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism.



 Start Kaitlib Fe no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week.



 COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (&gt;35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors.



 Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors.



 Stop Kaitlib Fe if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately.



    5.2 Carcinoma of the Breasts and Reproductive Organs



  Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use Kaitlib Fe because breast cancer is a hormonally-sensitive tumor.



 There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings.



 Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors.



    5.3 Liver Disease



  Discontinue Kaitlib Fe if jaundice develops. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded.



 Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage.



 Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (&gt; 8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users.



 Oral contraceptive-related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. Women with a history of COC-related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use.



    5.4 High Blood Pressure



  For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Kaitlib Fe if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs.



 An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin.



    5.5 Gallbladder Disease



  Studies suggest the relative risk of developing gallbladder disease may be increased among COC users.



    5.6 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects



  Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking Kaitlib Fe. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion.



 Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs.



 Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs.



    5.7 Headache



  If a woman taking Kaitlib Fe develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Kaitlib Fe if indicated.



 An increase in frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) may be a reason for immediate discontinuation of the COC.



    5.8 Bleeding Irregularities



  Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC.



 Patient diaries from the clinical trial of Kaitlib Fe showed that on the first cycle of use, 37% of subjects taking Kaitlib Fe had unscheduled bleeding and/ or spotting. From Cycle 2 to 13, the percent of women with unscheduled bleeding/spotting ranged from 21 to 31% per cycle. For those women with unscheduled bleeding/spotting, the mean number of days of unscheduled bleeding/spotting was 5.2 in the first cycle of use and ranged from 3.6 to 4.2 in cycles 2 to 13. A total of 15 subjects out of 1,677 (0.9%) discontinued the study prematurely due to metrorrhagia or irregular menstruation.



 Women who are not pregnant and use Kaitlib Fe may not have scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding every cycle or may experience amenorrhea (absence of any bleeding and spotting). The incidence of amenorrhea in the clinical trial increased from 8.1% of the subjects in Cycle 2 to 18.4% by Cycle 13. For those women who had scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding, the average duration of bleeding per cycle in Cycles 2 to 13 was 3.7 days.



 If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.



 Some women may encounter amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after stopping COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.



    5.9 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy



  Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned, when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Kaitlib Fe use should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed.



 The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see    USE    IN    SPECIFIC    POPULATIONS    (  8.1  )].  



    5.10 Depression



  Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and Kaitlib Fe discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree.



    5.11 Interference with Laboratory Tests



  The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increase with use of COCs.



    5.12 Monitoring



  A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare.



    5.13 Other Conditions



  In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking COCs.
