  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 The safety and efficacy of DITROPAN XL  (r)  (5 to 30 mg/day) was evaluated in 774 adult subjects who participated in five double-blind, controlled clinical trials. In four of the five studies, Ditropan IR (5 to 20 mg/day in 199 subjects) was an active comparator. Adverse reactions reported by &gt;= 1% of subjects are shown in Table 1.

         The discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 4.4% with DITROPAN XL  (r)  compared to 0% with Ditropan IR. The most frequent adverse reaction causing discontinuation of study medication was dry mouth (0.7%).
 

 The following adverse reactions were reported by &lt;1% of DITROPAN XL  (r)  -treated patients and at a higher incidence than placebo in clinical trials:  Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders:  anorexia, fluid retention;  Vascular disorders:  hot flush;  Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders:  dysphonia;  Gastrointestinal Disorders:  dysphagia, frequent bowel movements;  General disorders and administration site conditions:  chest discomfort, thirst.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following additional adverse reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with DITROPAN XL  (r)  . Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Infections and Infestations:  Urinary tract infection;  Psychiatric Disorders:  psychotic disorder, agitation, confusional state, hallucinations, memory impairment, abnormal behavior;  Nervous System Disorders:  convulsions;  Eye Disorders:  glaucoma;  Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders:  nasal congestion;  Cardiac Disorders:  arrhythmia, tachycardia, palpitations, QT interval prolongation;  Vascular Disorders:  flushing, hypertension;  Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders:  rash;  Renal and Urinary Disorders:  impotence;  General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions:  hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema with airway obstruction, urticaria, and face edema; anaphylactic reactions requiring hospitalization for emergency treatment;  Injury, poisoning and procedural complications:  fall.



 Additional adverse events reported with some other oxybutynin chloride formulations include: cycloplegia, mydriasis, and suppression of lactation.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Angioedema: Angioedema has been reported with oxybutynin. If symptoms of angioedema occur, discontinue DITROPAN XL  (r)  immediately and initiate appropriate therapy. (  5.1  ) 
 *  Central Nervous System (CNS) effects: CNS effects have been reported with oxybutynin. If patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, consider dose adjustment or discontinuation of DITROPAN XL  (r)  . (  5.2  ) 
 *  *  Pre-existing dementia in patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitors (  5.2  ), 
 *  Parkinson's disease (  5.2  ), 
 *  Myasthenia gravis (  5.3  ), and 
 *  Decreased gastrointestinal motility in patients with autonomic neuropathy. (  5.4  ). 
   Use with caution due to aggravation of symptoms: 
 *  Urinary Retention: Use with caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (  5.5  ) 
 *  Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: Use with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased intestinal motility due to risk of gastric retention. Use with caution in patients with gastroesophageal reflux or in patients concurrently taking drugs that can exacerbate esophagitis. (  5.6  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Angioedema



  Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with oxybutynin. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided.



    5.2 Central Nervous System Effects



  Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see  Adverse Reactions (6)  ]  . A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how DITROPAN XL  (r)  affects them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered.



 DITROPAN XL  (r)  should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms.



 DITROPAN XL  (r)  should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson's disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms.



    5.3 Worsening of Symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis



  DITROPAN XL  (r)  should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms.



    5.4 Worsening of Symptoms of Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility in Patients with Autonomic Neuropathy



  DITROPAN XL  (r)  should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility.



    5.5 Urinary Retention



  DITROPAN XL  (r)  should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see  Contraindications (4)  ]  .



    5.6 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions



  DITROPAN XL  (r)  should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [see  Contraindications (4)  ]  .



 DITROPAN XL  (r)  , like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis and intestinal atony.



 DITROPAN XL  (r)  should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis.



 As with any other nondeformable material, caution should be used when administering DITROPAN XL  (r)  to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations.
