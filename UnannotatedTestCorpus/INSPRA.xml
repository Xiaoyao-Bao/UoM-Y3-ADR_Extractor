  The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:



 *  Hyperkalemia [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  
      EXCERPT:     HFrEF Post-MI  : Most common adverse reactions (&gt;2% and more frequent than with placebo): hyperkalemia and increased creatinine. (  6.1  )
 

   Hypertension  : In clinical studies, adverse reactions with INSPRA were uncommon. (  6.1  )

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     Heart Failure Post-Myocardial Infarction  



 In EPHESUS, safety was evaluated in 3307 patients treated with INSPRA and 3301 placebo-treated patients. The overall incidence of adverse events reported with INSPRA (78.9%) was similar to placebo (79.5%). Adverse events occurred at a similar rate regardless of age, gender, or race. Patients discontinued treatment due to an adverse event at similar rates in either treatment group (4.4% INSPRA vs. 4.3% placebo), with the most common reasons for discontinuation being hyperkalemia, MI, and abnormal renal function.



 Adverse reactions that occurred more frequently in patients treated with INSPRA than placebo were hyperkalemia (3.4% vs. 2.0%) and increased creatinine (2.4% vs. 1.5%). Discontinuations due to hyperkalemia or abnormal renal function were less than 1.0% in both groups.



     Hypertension  



 INSPRA has been evaluated for safety in 3091 patients treated for hypertension. A total of 690 patients were treated for over 6 months and 106 patients were treated for over 1 year.



 In placebo-controlled studies, the overall rates of adverse events were 47% with INSPRA and 45% with placebo. Adverse events occurred at a similar rate regardless of age, gender, or race. Therapy was discontinued due to an adverse event in 3% of patients treated with INSPRA and 3% of patients given placebo. The most common reasons for discontinuation of INSPRA were headache, dizziness, angina pectoris/MI, and increased GGT.



 Gynecomastia and abnormal vaginal bleeding were reported with INSPRA but not with placebo. The rates increased with increasing duration of therapy.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of INSPRA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



     Skin:  angioneurotic edema, rash



   6.3 Clinical Laboratory Test Findings

    Heart Failure Post-Myocardial Infarction  



     Creatinine:  Increases of more than 0.5 mg/dL were reported for 6.5% of patients administered INSPRA and for 4.9% of placebo-treated patients.



     Potassium:  In EPHESUS  [see  Clinical Studies (14.1)  ]  , the frequencies of patients with changes in potassium (&lt;3.5 mEq/L or &gt;5.5 mEq/L or &gt;=6.0 mEq/L) receiving INSPRA compared with placebo are displayed in Table 2.

         Rates of hyperkalemia increased with decreasing renal function.

         The rates of hyperkalemia in EPHESUS in the INSPRA treated group vs. placebo were increased in patients with proteinuria (16% vs 11%), diabetes (18% vs. 13%) or both (26% vs. 16%).
 

     Hypertension  



     Potassium:  In placebo-controlled fixed-dose studies, the mean increases in serum potassium were dose-related and are shown in Table 4 along with the frequencies of values &gt;5.5 mEq/L.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Hyperkalemia: Patients with decreased renal function, diabetes, proteinuria or patients who are taking ACEs and ARBs, NSAIDs or moderate CYP3A inhibitors are at increased risk. Monitor serum potassium levels and adjust dose as needed. (  5.1  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Hyperkalemia



  The risk of hyperkalemia is higher in patients with impaired renal function, proteinuria, diabetes and those concomitantly treated with ACEs, ARBs, NSAIDs and moderate CYP3A inhibitors. Minimize the risk of hyperkalemia with proper patient selection and monitoring [see  Dosage and Administration (2.1)  ,  Contraindications (4)  ,  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  , and  Drug Interactions (7)  ]  . Monitor patients for the development of hyperkalemia until the effect of INSPRA is established. Patients who develop hyperkalemia (5.5-5.9 mEq/L) may continue INSPRA therapy with proper dose adjustment. Dose reduction decreases potassium levels. Patients on moderate CYP3A inhibitors that cannot be avoided should have their dose of eplerenone reduced [see  Drug Interactions (7.2)  ].
