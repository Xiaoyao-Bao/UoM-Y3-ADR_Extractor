  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



     Autologous Peripheral Blood Progenitor Cell (PBPC) and Bone Marrow Transplantation  



 Studies 301, 302 and 303 enrolled a total of 156 patients after autologous or allogeneic marrow or PBPC transplantation. In these placebo-controlled studies, pediatric and adult patients received once-daily intravenous infusions of LEUKINE 250 mcg/m  2  or placebo for 21 days.



 In Studies 301, 302, and 303, there was no difference in relapse rate between the LEUKINE and placebo-treated patients. Adverse reactions reported in at least 10% of patients who received intravenous LEUKINE or at a rate that was at least 5% higher than the placebo arm are shown in Table 1.

            There was no significant difference between the arms in the proportion of patients achieving complete remission (CR; 69% in the LEUKINE group and 55% in the placebo group). There was also no significant difference in relapse rates; 12 of 36 patients who received LEUKINE and five of 26 patients who received placebo relapsed within 180 days of documented CR (p=0.26). The study was not sized to assess the impact of LEUKINE treatment on response.
 

     Graft Failure  



 In a historically controlled study of 86 patients with AML, the LEUKINE treated group exhibited an increased incidence of weight gain (p=0.007), low serum proteins, and prolonged prothrombin time (p=0.02) when compared to the control group. Two LEUKINE treated patients had progressive increase in circulating monocytes and promonocytes and blasts in the marrow, which reversed when LEUKINE was discontinued. The historical control group exhibited an increased incidence of cardiac events (p=0.018), liver function abnormalities (p=0.008), and neurocortical hemorrhagic events (p=0.025). Headache (26%), pericardial effusion (25%), arthralgia (21%), and myalgia (18%) were also reported in patients treated with LEUKINE in the graft failure study.



   6.2 Immunogenicity

  As with all therapeutic proteins, there is the potential for immunogenicity with LEUKINE. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, duration of treatment, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to sargramostim in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or other products may be misleading.



 In 214 patients with a variety of underlying diseases, neutralizing anti-sargramostim antibodies were detected in 5 patients (2.3%) after receiving LEUKINE by continuous IV infusion (3 patients) or SC injection (2 patients) for 28 to 84 days in multiple courses (as assessed by GM-CSF dependent human cell-line proliferation assay). All 5 patients had impaired hematopoiesis before the administration of LEUKINE, and consequently the effect of the development of anti-sargramostim antibodies on normal hematopoiesis could not be assessed.



 Antibody studies of 75 patients with Crohn's disease (a disease for which LEUKINE is not indicated), with normal hematopoiesis and no other immunosuppressive drugs, receiving LEUKINE daily for 8 weeks by SC injection, showed 1 patient (1.3%) with detectable neutralizing anti-sargramostim antibodies (as assessed by GM-CSF dependent human cell-line proliferation assay).



 In an experimental use trial where LEUKINE was given for an extended period, 53 patients with melanoma in complete remission (a disease for which LEUKINE is not indicated) received adjuvant therapy with LEUKINE 125 mcg/m  2  once daily (maximum dose 250 mcg) from day 1 to 14 every 28 days for 1 year. Serum samples from patients assessed at day 0, 2 weeks, 1 month, and 5 and/or 12 months were tested retrospectively for the presence of anti-sargramostim antibodies. Of 43 evaluable patients (having at least 3 timepoint samples post treatment), 42 (97.7%) developed anti-sargramostim binding antibody as assessed by ELISA and confirmed using an immunoprecipitation assay. Of these 42 patients, 41 had sufficient sample and were further tested: 34 patients (82.9%) developed anti-sargramostim neutralizing antibodies (as determined by a cell based luciferase reporter gene neutralizing antibody assay); 17 (50%) of these patients did not have a sustained pharmacodynamic effect of LEUKINE by day 155 as assessed by WBC counts. This study provided limited assessment of the impact of antibody formation on the safety and efficacy of LEUKINE.



 Serious allergic and anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with LEUKINE, but the rate of occurrence of antibodies in such patients has not been assessed.



   6.3 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of LEUKINE in clinical trials and/or postmarketing surveillance. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 *  Infusion related reactions including dyspnea, hypoxia, flushing, hypotension, syncope and/or tachycardia [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  
 *  Serious allergic reactions/hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis, skin rash, urticaria, generalized erythema, and flushing [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]  
 *  Effusions and capillary leak syndrome [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  
 *  Supraventricular arrhythmias [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.4)  ]  
 *  Leukocytosis including eosinophilia [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.6)  ]  
 *  Thromboembolic events 
 *  Pain, including chest, abdominal, back, and joint pain 
 *  Injection site reactions

   EXCERPT:    *  Hypersensitivity Reactions: Permanently discontinue LEUKINE in patients with serious allergic reactions. (  5.1  ) 
 *  Infusion Related Reactions: Manage using infusion rate reductions or discontinuations. (  5.2  ) 
 *  Effusions and Capillary Leak Syndrome: Manage with dose-reduction, discontinuation, or diuretics. Monitor body weight and hydration status during therapy. (  5.4  ) 
 *  Supraventricular Arrhythmias: Risk may be increased in patients with history of cardiac arrhythmias. Manage medically and discontinue LEUKINE. (  5.5  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions



  Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have been reported with LEUKINE. Parenteral administration of LEUKINE should be attended by appropriate precautions in case an allergic or untoward reaction occurs. If any serious allergic or anaphylactic reaction occurs, immediately discontinue LEUKINE therapy and institute medical management. Discontinue LEUKINE permanently for patients with serious allergic reactions.



    5.2 Infusion Related Reactions



   LEUKINE can cause infusion-related reactions. Infusion-related reactions may be characterized by respiratory distress, hypoxia, flushing, hypotension, syncope, and/or tachycardia following the first administration of LEUKINE in a particular cycle. These signs have resolved with symptomatic treatment and usually do not recur with subsequent doses in the same cycle of treatment.  



 Observe closely during infusion for symptoms, particularly in patients with pre-existing lung disease. If patients display dyspnea or other acute symptoms, reduce the rate of infusion by 50%. If symptoms persist or worsen despite rate reduction, discontinue the LEUKINE infusion. If patient experiences infusion-related reaction, subsequent intravenous infusions may be administered following the standard dose schedule with careful monitoring.



    5.3 Risk of Severe Myelosuppression when LEUKINE Administered within 24 hours of Chemotherapy or Radiotherapy



   Due to the potential sensitivity of rapidly dividing hematopoietic progenitor cells, LEUKINE should not be administered simultaneously with or within 24 hours preceding cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiotherapy or within 24 hours following chemotherapy. In one controlled study, patients with small cell lung cancer received LEUKINE and concurrent thoracic radiotherapy and chemotherapy or the identical radiotherapy and chemotherapy without LEUKINE. The patients randomized to LEUKINE had significantly higher incidence of adverse reactions, including higher mortality and a higher incidence of grade 3 and 4 infections and grade 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia.  



    5.4 Effusions and Capillary Leak Syndrome



   Edema, capillary leak syndrome, and pleural and/or pericardial effusion, have been reported in patients after LEUKINE administration. In 156 patients enrolled in placebo-controlled studies using LEUKINE at a dose of 250 mcg/m  2  /day by 2-hour IV infusion, the reported incidences of fluid retention (LEUKINE vs. placebo) were as follows: peripheral edema, 11% vs. 7%; pleural effusion, 1% vs. 0%; and pericardial effusion, 4% vs. 1%. Capillary leak syndrome was not observed in this limited number of studies; based on other uncontrolled studies and reports from users of marketed LEUKINE, the incidence is estimated to be less than 1%. In patients with preexisting pleural and pericardial effusions, administration of LEUKINE may aggravate fluid retention; however, fluid retention associated with or worsened by LEUKINE has been reversible after interruption or dose reduction of LEUKINE with or without diuretic therapy. LEUKINE should be used with caution in patients with preexisting fluid retention, pulmonary infiltrates, or congestive heart failure. Body weight and hydration status should be carefully monitored during LEUKINE administration.  



    5.5 Supraventricular Arrhythmias



   Supraventricular arrhythmia has been reported in uncontrolled studies during LEUKINE administration, particularly in patients with a previous history of cardiac arrhythmia. These arrhythmias have been reversible after discontinuation of LEUKINE. Use LEUKINE with caution in patients with preexisting cardiac disease.  



    5.6 Leukocytosis



   White blood cell counts of &gt;= 50,000/mm  3  were observed in patients receiving LEUKINE. Monitor complete blood counts (CBC) with differential twice per week. Base the decision whether to reduce the dose or interrupt treatment on the clinical condition of the patient [see  Dosage and Administration (2.1  ,  2.4  ,  2.5  ,  2.6)  ]  . Following cessation of LEUKINE therapy, excessive blood counts have returned to normal or baseline levels within 3 to 7 days.  



    5.7 Potential Effect on Malignant Cells



   LEUKINE is a growth factor that primarily stimulates normal myeloid precursors. However, the possibility that LEUKINE can act as a growth factor for any tumor type, particularly myeloid malignancies, cannot be excluded. Because of the possibility of tumor growth potentiation, precaution should be exercised when using this drug in any malignancy with myeloid characteristics.  



  Discontinue LEUKINE therapy if disease progression is detected during LEUKINE treatment.  



    5.8 Immunogenicity



  Treatment with LEUKINE may induce neutralizing anti-drug antibodies. The incidence of anti-sargramostim neutralizing antibodies may be related to duration of exposure to LEUKINE. In a study of patients with normal neutrophil count and a solid tumor in complete response (an unapproved use) treated with LEUKINE for up to 12 months, 82.9% of 41 evaluable patients developed anti-sargramostim neutralizing antibodies and the myelostimulatory effect of LEUKINE was not sustained by day 155 as assessed by WBC count. Use LEUKINE for the shortest duration required [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ]  .



    5.9 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative



   Serious and fatal adverse reactions including "gasping syndrome" can occur in neonates and low birth weight infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including LEUKINE injection (solution) or LEUKINE for injection (lyophilized powder) reconstituted with Bacteriostatic Water. The "gasping syndrome" is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis and gasping respirations.  



  Avoid administration of solutions containing benzyl alcohol (including LEUKINE injection [solution] or LEUKINE for injection [lyophilized powder] reconstituted with Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP [0.9% benzyl alcohol]) to neonates and low birth weight infants. Instead, administer lyophilized LEUKINE reconstituted with Sterile Water for Injection, USP [see  Dosage and Administration (2.7)  ]  .  



  If LEUKINE injection (solution) or LEUKINE for injection (lyophilized powder) reconstituted with Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP (0.9% benzyl alcohol) must be used in neonates and low birth weight infants, consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including LEUKINE (LEUKINE injection and LEUKINE for injection reconstituted with Bacteriostatic Water contain 11 mg and 9 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL, respectively). The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which serious adverse reactions may occur is not known [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.4)  and  Dosage and Administration (2.7)  ].
