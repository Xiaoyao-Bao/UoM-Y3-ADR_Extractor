    6.1 Clinical Trials Experience  

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug, and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 In total, Asacol tablets have been evaluated in 2,690 patients with ulcerative colitis in controlled and open-label trials.



 Clinical studies supporting Asacol use for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis included two 6-week, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind studies in adults with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis (Studies 1 and 2), and one 6-week, randomized, double-blind, study of 2 dosage levels in children with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis (Study 3). Clinical studies supporting the use of Asacol tablets in the maintenance of remission of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis included a 6-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study (Study 4) and four active-controlled maintenance trials comparing Asacol tablets with sulfasalazine. Asacol has been evaluated in 427 adults and 82 children with ulcerative colitis in these controlled studies.



   Treatment of Mildly to Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis  



   Adults  



 In a 6-week placebo-controlled clinical study (Study 1) involving 105 patients, 53 of whom were randomized to Asacol 2.4 grams/day  [see Clinical Studies (      14.1      )]  , 4% of the Asacol-treated patients in 2.4 grams/day group discontinued therapy because of adverse reactions as compared to 0% of the placebo-treated patients. The average age of patients was 41 years and 49% of patients were male. Adverse reactions leading to withdrawal from Asacol included (each in one patient): diarrhea and colitis flare; dizziness, nausea, joint pain, and headache.



 The most common adverse reactions in patients treated with Asacol 2.4 grams/day in Study 1 are listed in Table 2 below.

   Pediatric Patients 5 to 17 Years         Old  



 A randomized, double-blind, 6-week study of 2 dosage levels of Asacol (Study 3) was conducted in 82 pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. All patients were divided by body weight category (17 to less than 33 kg, 33 to less than 54 kg, and 54 to 90 kg) and randomly assigned to receive a low dosage (1.2, 2, and 2.4 grams/day for the respective body weight category) or a high dosage (2, 3.6, and 4.8 grams/day).



 The high dosage regimen is not recommended because it was not found to be more effective than the recommended low dosage regimen       [see Dosage and Administration (      2.1      )    and Clinical Studies (      14.1      )    ]  .



 Duration of exposure to Asacol among the 82 patients in the study ranged from 12 to 50 days (mean of 40 days in each dosage group). The majority (88%) of patients in each group were treated for more than 5 weeks. Table 3 provides a summary of the specific reported adverse reactions.

 Low Dosage = Asacol 1.2 to 2.4 grams/day; High Dosage = Asacol 2.0 to 4.8 grams/day. Dosage was dependent on body weight.Adverse Reactions reported at the 1-week telephone follow-up visit are included.   
         * At Least 5% of Patients in the low dosage or high dosage group
 

 Twelve percent of the patients in the low dosage group (5 patients) and 2% of the patients in the high dosage group (1 patient) had serious adverse reactions. The serious adverse reactions consisted of sinusitis, adenovirus infection, and pancreatitis in one patient each in the low dosage group. Abdominal pain and decreased body mass index occurred in one patient and bloody diarrhea and sclerosing cholangitis also occurred in one patient in the low dosage group. Anemia and syncope occurred in one patient in the high dosage group.



 Five patients were withdrawn from the study due to adverse reactions: 3 (7%) in the low dosage group (1 patient each with adenovirus infection, sclerosing cholangitis, and pancreatitis) and 2 patients (5%) in the high dosage group (1 patient with increased amylase and increased lipase, and 1 patient with upper abdominal pain).  



 In general, the nature and severity of reactions in the pediatric population was similar to those reported in adult populations of patients with ulcerative colitis.



   Maintenance of Remission of    Mildly to Moderately Active    Ulcerative Colitis  



 Clinical studies supporting the use of Asacol tablets in the maintenance of remission of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis in adults included a randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 6 months' duration in 264 patients (Study 4  [see Clinical Studies (      14.2      )]  .



 In Study 4, a randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 6 months' duration, 87 patients were randomized to receive Asacol 1.6 grams/day compared to 87 patients randomized to placebo. The average age of patients in Study 4 was 42 years and 55 % of patients were male. Adverse reactions leading to study withdrawal in patients using Asacol included (each in one patient): anxiety, stomatitis and asthenia.



 In addition to the adverse reactions listed in Table 2, the following occurred at a frequency of 2% or greater in patients who received Asacol in Study 4: abdominal enlargement, gastroenteritis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, infection, joint disorder, nervousness, paresthesia, hemorrhoids, tenesmus, urinary frequency, and vision abnormalities.



     6.2 Postmarketing Experience  

  In addition to the adverse reactions reported above in clinical trials involving Asacol, the adverse reactions listed below have been identified during post-approval use of Asacol and other mesalamine-containing products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">     5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  



   EXCERPT:    *   Renal Impairment:  Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drugs; monitor renal function (  5.1  ,  7.1  ,  8.6  ,  13.2  ) 
 *   Mesalamine-induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome : Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from a UC exacerbation; monitor for worsening symptoms; discontinue if acute intolerance syndrome suspected (  5.2  ) 
 *   Hypersensitivity Reactions  , including Myocarditis and Pericarditis  :  Evaluate patients immediately and discontinue if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected (  5.3  ) 
 *   Hepatic Failur e :  Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known liver impairment (  5.4  ) 
    
 

    5.1 Renal Impairment  



  Renal impairment, including minimal change nephropathy, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and renal failure, has been reported in patients taking products such as Asacol that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine.  [see Adverse Reactions (     6.2     )].  



 Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of Asacol and periodically while on therapy.



 Evaluate the risks and benefits of using Asacol in patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs  [   see Drug Interactions (     7.1     ), Use in Specific Populations (     8.6     ) and Nonclinical Toxicology (     13.2     )]  .



     5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome  



  Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Monitor patients for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with Asacol.



     5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions  



  Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to Asacol or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine. 



 As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue Asacol if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.



     5.4 Hepatic Failure  



  There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using Asacol in patients with known liver impairment.
