  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely variable conditions, adverse event rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates of clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

     Mantle Cell Lymphoma  

 The data described below reflect exposure to IMBRUVICA in a clinical trial (Study 1104) that included 111 patients with previously treated MCL treated with 560 mg daily with a median treatment duration of 8.3 months.

 The most commonly occurring adverse reactions (&gt;= 20%) were thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, neutropenia, anemia, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, peripheral edema, upper respiratory tract infection, nausea, bruising, dyspnea, constipation, rash, abdominal pain, vomiting and decreased appetite (see  Tables 1  and  2  ).

 The most common Grade 3 or 4 non-hematological adverse reactions (&gt;= 5%) were pneumonia, abdominal pain, atrial fibrillation, diarrhea, fatigue, and skin infections.

 Fatal and serious cases of renal failure have occurred with IMBRUVICA therapy. Increases in creatinine 1.5 to 3 times the upper limit of normal occurred in 9% of patients.

 Adverse reactions from the MCL trial (N=111) using single agent IMBRUVICA 560 mg daily occurring at a rate of &gt;= 10% are presented in  Table 1  .

         Ten patients (9%) discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions in the trial (N=111). The most frequent adverse reaction leading to treatment discontinuation was subdural hematoma (1.8%). Adverse reactions leading to dose reduction occurred in 14% of patients.
 

 Patients with MCL who develop lymphocytosis greater than 400,000/mcL have developed intracranial hemorrhage, lethargy, gait instability, and headache. However, some of these cases were in the setting of disease progression.

 Forty percent of patients had elevated uric acid levels on study including 13% with values above 10 mg/dL. Adverse reaction of hyperuricemia was reported for 15% of patients.

     Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia  /  Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma  

 The data described below reflect exposure in one single-arm, open-label clinical trial (Study 1102) and three randomized controlled clinical trials (RESONATE, RESONATE-2, and HELIOS) in patients with CLL/SLL (n=1278 total and n=668 patients exposed to IMBRUVICA). Study 1102 included 51 patients with previously treated CLL/SLL, RESONATE included 391 randomized patients with previously treated CLL or SLL who received single agent IMBRUVICA or ofatumumab, RESONATE-2 included 269 randomized patients 65 years or older with treatment naive-CLL or SLL who received single agent IMBRUVICA or chlorambucil, and HELIOS included 578 randomized patients with previously treated CLL or SLL who received IMBRUVICA in combination with bendamustine and rituximab or placebo in combination with bendamustine and rituximab.

 The most commonly occurring adverse reactions in Studies 1102, RESONATE, RESONATE-2, and HELIOS in patients with CLL/SLL receiving IMBRUVICA (&gt;= 20%) were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, diarrhea, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, rash, bruising, fatigue, pyrexia and hemorrhage. Four to 10 percent of patients receiving IMBRUVICA in Studies 1102, RESONATE, RESONATE-2, and HELIOS discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions. These included pneumonia, hemorrhage, atrial fibrillation, rash and neutropenia (1% each). Adverse reactions leading to dose reduction occurred in approximately 6% of patients.

     Study 1102  

 Adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities from the CLL/SLL trial (N=51) using single agent IMBRUVICA 420 mg daily in patients with previously treated CLL/SLL occurring at a rate of &gt;= 10% with a median duration of treatment of 15.6 months are presented in  Tables 3  and  4  .

           Atrial fibrillation of any grade occurred in 7% of patients treated with IMBRUVICA + BR and 2% of patients treated with placebo + BR. The frequency of Grade 3 and 4 atrial fibrillation was 3% in patients treated with IMBRUVICA + BR and 1% in patients treated with placebo +BR.
 

     Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia and Marginal Zone Lymphoma  

 The data described below reflect exposure to IMBRUVICA in open-label clinical trials that included 63 patients with previously treated WM (Study 1118) and 63 patients with previously treated MZL (Study 1121).

 The most commonly occurring adverse reactions in Studies 1118 and 1121 (&gt;= 20%) were thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, neutropenia, fatigue, bruising, hemorrhage, anemia, rash, musculoskeletal pain, and nausea.

 Nine percent of patients receiving IMBRUVICA across Studies 1118 and 1121 discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were interstitial lung disease, diarrhea and rash. Adverse reactions leading to dose reduction occurred in 10% of patients.

 The data described below reflect exposure to IMBRUVICA in an open-label clinical trial (Study 1129) that included 42 patients with cGVHD after failure of first line corticosteroid therapy and required additional therapy.

 The most commonly occurring adverse reactions in the cGVHD trial (&gt;= 20%) were fatigue, bruising, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, stomatitis, muscle spasms, nausea, hemorrhage, anemia, and pneumonia. Atrial fibrillation occurred in one patient (2%) which was Grade 3.

 Twenty-four percent of patients receiving IMBRUVICA in the cGVHD trial discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were fatigue and pneumonia. Adverse reactions leading to dose reduction occurred in 26% of patients.

 Adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities described below in  Tables 13  and  14  reflect exposure to IMBRUVICA with a median duration of 4.4 months in the cGVHD trial.

             Additional Important Adverse Reactions  
 

     Diarrhea  

 Diarrhea of any grade occurred at a rate of 43% (range, 36% to 59%) of patients treated with IMBRUVICA. Grade 2 diarrhea occurred in 9% (range, 3% to 14%) and Grade 3 in 3% (range, 0 to 5%) of patients treated with IMBRUVICA. The median time to first onset of any grade diarrhea was 10 days (range, 0 to 627), of Grade 2 was 39 days (range, 1 to 719) and of Grade 3 was 74 days (range, 3 to 627). Of the patients who reported diarrhea, 82% had complete resolution, 1% had partial improvement and 17% had no reported improvement at time of analysis. The median time from onset to resolution or improvement of any grade diarrhea was 5 days (range, 1 to 418), and was similar for Grades 2 and 3. Less than 1% of patients discontinued IMBRUVICA due to diarrhea.

     Visual Disturbance  

 Blurred vision and decreased visual acuity of any grade occurred in 10% of patients treated with IMBRUVICA (9% Grade 1, 2% Grade 2). The median time to first onset was 85 days (range, 1 to 414 days). Of the patients with visual disturbance, 61% had complete resolution and 38% had no reported improvement at time of analysis. The median time from onset to resolution or improvement was 29 days (range, 1 to 335 days).

   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of IMBRUVICA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

 Hepatobiliary disorders: hepatic failure

 Respiratory disorders: interstitial lung disease

 Metabolic and nutrition disorders: tumor lysis syndrome  [  see  Warnings &amp; Precautions (  5.7  )]  

 Immune system disorders: anaphylactic shock, angioedema, urticaria

 Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), onychoclasis

 Infections: hepatitis B reactivation

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">   5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

   EXCERPT:    *  Hemorrhage: Monitor for bleeding and manage (  5.1  ). 
 *  Infections: Monitor patients for fever and infections, evaluate promptly, and treat (  5.2  ). 
 *  Cytopenias: Check complete blood counts monthly (  5.3  ). 
 *  Atrial Fibrillation: Monitor for atrial fibrillation and manage (  5.4  ). 
 *  Hypertension: Monitor blood pressure and treat (  5.5  ). 
 *  Second Primary Malignancies: Other malignancies have occurred in patients, including skin cancers, and other carcinomas (  5.6  ). 
 *  Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS): Assess baseline risk and take precautions. Monitor and treat for TLS (  5.7  ). 
 *  Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of the potential risk to a fetus and to avoid pregnancy while taking the drug and for 1 month after cessation of therapy. Advise men to avoid fathering a child during the same time period (  5.8  ,  8.3  ). 
    
 

   5.1 Hemorrhage

  Fatal bleeding events have occurred in patients treated with IMBRUVICA. Grade 3 or higher bleeding events (intracranial hemorrhage [including subdural hematoma], gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, and post procedural hemorrhage) have occurred in up to 6% of patients. Bleeding events of any grade, including bruising and petechiae, occurred in approximately half of patients treated with IMBRUVICA.

 The mechanism for the bleeding events is not well understood.

 IMBRUVICA may increase the risk of hemorrhage in patients receiving antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapies and patients should be monitored for signs of bleeding.

 Consider the benefit-risk of withholding IMBRUVICA for at least 3 to 7 days pre and post-surgery depending upon the type of surgery and the risk of bleeding [see Clinical Studies (  14  )].  

    5.2 Infections

   Fatal and non-fatal infections (including bacterial, viral, or fungal) have occurred with IMBRUVICA therapy. Grade 3 or greater infections occurred in 14% to 29% of patients [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  ,  6.2  )]  . Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and Pneumocystis jirovecii  pneumonia (PJP) have occurred in patients treated with IMBRUVICA. Consider prophylaxis according to standard of care in patients who are at increased risk for opportunistic infections. Monitor and evaluate patients for fever and infections and treat appropriately.  

    5.3 Cytopenias

   Treatment-emergent Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias including neutropenia (range, 13 to 29%), thrombocytopenia (range, 5 to 17%), and anemia (range, 0 to 13%) based on laboratory measurements occurred in patients with B-cell malignancies treated with single agent IMBRUVICA.  

 Monitor complete blood counts monthly.

    5.4 Atrial Fibrillation

  Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter (range, 6 to 9%) have occurred in patients treated with IMBRUVICA, particularly in patients with cardiac risk factors, hypertension, acute infections, and a previous history of atrial fibrillation. Periodically monitor patients clinically for atrial fibrillation. Patients who develop arrhythmic symptoms (e.g., palpitations, lightheadedness) or new onset dyspnea should have an ECG performed. Atrial fibrillation should be managed appropriately, and if it persists, consider the risks and benefits of IMBRUVICA treatment and follow dose modification guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (  2.3  )]  .

    5.5 Hypertension

  Hypertension (range, 6 to 17%) has occurred in patients treated with IMBRUVICA with a median time to onset of 4.6 months (range, 0.03 to 22 months). Monitor patients for new onset hypertension or hypertension that is not adequately controlled after starting IMBRUVICA. Adjust existing anti-hypertensive medications and/or initiate anti-hypertensive treatment as appropriate.

    5.6 Second Primary Malignancies

   Other malignancies (range, 3 to 16%) including non-skin carcinomas (range, 1 to 4%) have occurred in patients treated with IMBRUVICA. The most frequent second primary malignancy was non-melanoma skin cancer (range, 2 to 13%).  

    5.7 Tumor Lysis Syndrome

  Tumor lysis syndrome has been infrequently reported with IMBRUVICA therapy. Assess the baseline risk (e.g., high tumor burden) and take appropriate precautions. Monitor patients closely and treat as appropriate.

    5.8 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

   Based on findings in animals, IMBRUVICA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Administration of ibrutinib to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis caused embryofetal toxicity including malformations at exposures that were 2-20 times higher than those reported in patients with hematologic malignancies. Advise women to avoid becoming pregnant while taking IMBRUVICA and for 1 month after cessation of therapy. If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  )]  .
