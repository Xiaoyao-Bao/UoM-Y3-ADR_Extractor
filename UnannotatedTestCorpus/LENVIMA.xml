    6.1         Clinical Trials Experience  

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The data in the Warnings and Precautions reflect exposure to LENVIMA as a single agent in 261 patients with DTC (SELECT) and 476 patients with HCC (REFLECT), and to LENVIMA with everolimus in 62 patients with RCC (Study 205). Safety data obtained in 1823 patients with advanced solid tumors who received LENVIMA as a single agent across multiple clinical studies was used to further characterize the risks of serious adverse reactions. Among the 1823 patients who received LENVIMA as a single agent, the median age was 61 years (20 to 89 years), the dose range was 0.2 mg to 32 mg daily, and the median duration of exposure was 5.6 months.



 The data below reflect exposure to LENVIMA in 799 patients enrolled in randomized, active-controlled trials (REFLECT; Study 205) or a randomized, placebo-controlled trial (SELECT). The median duration of exposure to LENVIMA across these three studies ranged from 6 to 16 months. The demographic and exposure data for each clinical trial population are described in the subsections below.



   Differentiated Thyroid Cancer  



 The safety of LENVIMA was evaluated in SELECT, in which patients with radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer were randomized (2:1) to LENVIMA (n=261) or placebo (n=131)  [    see Clinical Studies (      14.1      )    ]  . The median treatment duration was 16.1 months for LENVIMA. Among 261 patients who received LENVIMA, median age was 64 years, 52% were females, 80% were White, 18% were Asian, and 2% were Black; and 4% were Hispanic/Latino. 



 The most common adverse reactions observed in LENVIMA-treated patients (&gt;=30%) were, in order of decreasing frequency, hypertension, fatigue, diarrhea, arthralgia/myalgia, decreased appetite, decreased weight, nausea, stomatitis, headache, vomiting, proteinuria, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE) syndrome, abdominal pain, and dysphonia. The most common serious adverse reactions (at least 2%) were pneumonia (4%), hypertension (3%), and dehydration (3%).



 Adverse reactions led to dose reductions in 68% of patients receiving LENVIMA; 18% of patients discontinued LENVIMA for adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions (at least 10%) resulting in dose reductions of LENVIMA were hypertension (13%), proteinuria (11%), decreased appetite (10%), and diarrhea (10%); the most common adverse reactions (at least 1%) resulting in discontinuation of LENVIMA were hypertension (1%) and asthenia (1%).



 Table 3 presents adverse reactions occurring at a higher rate in LENVIMA-treated patients than patients receiving placebo in the double-blind phase of the study.

   Renal Cell Carcinoma       



 The safety of LENVIMA was evaluated in Study 205, in which patients with unresectable advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) were randomized (1:1:1) to LENVIMA 18 mg orally once daily with everolimus 5 mg orally once daily (n=51), LENVIMA 24 mg orally once daily (n=52), or everolimus 10 mg orally once daily (n=50)  [see Clinical Studies    (      14.2      )    ]  . This data also includes     patients on the dose escalation portion of the study who received LENVIMA with everolimus (n=11). The median treatment duration was 8.1 months for LENVIMA with everolimus. Among 62 patients who received LENVIMA with everolimus, the median age was 61 years, 71% were men, and 98% were White.



 The most common adverse reactions observed in the LENVIMA with everolimus-treated group (&gt;=30%) were, in order of decreasing frequency, diarrhea, fatigue, arthralgia/myalgia, decreased appetite, vomiting, nausea, stomatitis/oral inflammation, hypertension, peripheral edema, cough, abdominal pain, dyspnea, rash, decreased weight, hemorrhagic events, and proteinuria. The most common serious adverse reactions (&gt;=5%) were renal failure (11%), dehydration (10%), anemia (6%), thrombocytopenia (5%), diarrhea (5%), vomiting (5%), and dyspnea (5%).



 Adverse reactions led to dose reductions or interruption in 89% of patients receiving LENVIMA with everolimus. The most common adverse reactions (&gt;=5%) resulting in dose reductions in the LENVIMA with everolimus-treated group were diarrhea (21%), fatigue (8%), thrombocytopenia (6%), vomiting (6%), nausea (5%), and proteinuria (5%).



 Treatment discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 29% of patients in the LENVIMA with everolimus-treated group.



 Table 5 presents the adverse reactions in &gt;15% of patients in the LENVIMA with everolimus arm. Study 205 was not designed to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in adverse reaction rates for LENVIMA in combination with everolimus, as compared to everolimus for any specific adverse reaction listed in Table 5.

           Hepatocellular Carcinoma  
 

 The safety of LENVIMA was evaluated in REFLECT, which randomized (1:1) patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to LENVIMA (n=476) or sorafenib (n=475)  [    see Clinical Studies (      14.3      )    ]  . The dose of LENVIMA was 12 mg orally once daily for patients with a baseline body weight of &gt;=60 kg and 8 mg orally once daily for patients with a baseline body weight of &lt;60 kg. The dose of sorafenib was 400 mg orally twice daily. Duration of treatment was &gt;=6 months in 49% and 32% of patients in the LENVIMA and sorafenib groups, respectively. Among the 476 patients who received LENVIMA in REFLECT, the median age was 63 years, 85% were men, 28% were White and 70% were Asian. 



 The most common adverse reactions observed in the LENVIMA-treated patients (&gt;=20%) were, in order of decreasing frequency, hypertension, fatigue, diarrhea, decreased appetite, arthralgia/myalgia, decreased weight, abdominal pain, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, proteinuria, dysphonia, hemorrhagic events, hypothyroidism, and nausea. 



 The most common serious adverse reactions (&gt;=2%) in LENVIMA-treated patients were hepatic encephalopathy (5%), hepatic failure (3%), ascites (3%), and decreased appetite (2%).



 Adverse reactions led to dose reduction or interruption in 62% of patients receiving LENVIMA. The most common adverse reactions (&gt;=5%) resulting in dose reduction or interruption of LENVIMA were fatigue (9%), decreased appetite (8%), diarrhea (8%), proteinuria (7%), hypertension (6%), and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (5%).



 Treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients in the LENVIMA-treated group. The most common adverse reactions (&gt;=1%) resulting in discontinuation of LENVIMA were fatigue (1%), hepatic encephalopathy (2%), hyperbilirubinemia (1%), and hepatic failure (1%). 



 Table 7 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred in &gt;=10% of patients receiving LENVIMA in REFLECT. REFLECT was not designed to demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in adverse reaction rates for LENVIMA, as compared to sorafenib, for any specified adverse reaction listed in Table 7.

    5.1        Hypertension  



  Hypertension occurred in 73% of patients in SELECT (DTC) receiving LENVIMA 24 mg orally once daily and in 45% of patients in REFLECT (HCC) receiving LENVIMA 8 mg or 12 mg orally once daily. The median time to onset of new or worsening hypertension was 16 days in SELECT and 26 days in REFLECT. Grade 3 hypertension occurred in 44% of patients in SELECT and in 24% in REFLECT. Grade 4 hypertension occurred &lt;1% in SELECT and Grade 4 hypertension was not reported in REFLECT.



 In patients receiving LENVIMA 18 mg orally once daily with everolimus in Study 205 (RCC), hypertension was reported in 42% of patients and the median time to onset of new or worsening hypertension was 35 days. Grade 3 hypertension occurred in 13% of patients. Systolic blood pressure &gt;=160 mmHg occurred in 29% of patients and diastolic blood pressure &gt;=100 mmHg occurred in 21% [see Adverse Reactions (     6.1     )].  



  Serious complications of poorly controlled hypertension have been reported.  



 Control blood pressure prior to initiating LENVIMA. Monitor blood pressure after 1 week, then every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, and then at least monthly thereafter during treatment. Withhold and resume at a reduced dose when hypertension is controlled or permanently discontinue LENVIMA based on severity [   see Dosage and Administration   (     2.5     )].  



     5.2        Cardiac Dysfunction  



  Serious and fatal cardiac dysfunction can occur with LENVIMA. Across clinical trials in 799 patients with DTC, RCC or HCC, Grade 3 or higher cardiac dysfunction (including cardiomyopathy, left or right ventricular dysfunction, congestive heart failure, cardiac failure, ventricular hypokinesia, or decrease in left or right ventricular ejection fraction of more than 20% from baseline) occurred in 3% of LENVIMA-treated patients. 



 Monitor patients for clinical symptoms or signs of cardiac dysfunction. Withhold and resume at a reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue LENVIMA based on severity [   see   Dosage and Administration   (     2.5     )   ]  .



     5.3        Arterial Thromboembolic Events  



  Among patients receiving LENVIMA or LENVIMA with everolimus, arterial thromboembolic events of any severity occurred in 2% of patients in Study 205 (RCC), 2% of patients in REFLECT (HCC) and 5% of patients in SELECT (DTC). Grade 3 to 5 arterial thromboembolic events ranged from 2% to 3% across all clinical trials  [see Adverse   Reactions   (     6.1     )]  .



 Permanently discontinue LENVIMA following an arterial thrombotic event  [   see   Dosage and Administration (     2.5     )   ]  . The safety of resuming LENVIMA after an arterial thromboembolic event has not been established and LENVIMA has not been studied in patients who have had an arterial thromboembolic event within the previous 6 months.



     5.4        Hepatotoxicity  



  Across clinical studies enrolling 1327 LENVIMA-treated patients with malignancies other than HCC, serious hepatic adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% of patients. Fatal events, including hepatic failure, acute hepatitis and hepatorenal syndrome, occurred in 0.5% of patients. 



 In REFLECT (HCC), hepatic encephalopathy (including hepatic encephalopathy, encephalopathy, metabolic encephalopathy, and hepatic coma) occurred in 8% of LENVIMA-treated patients and 3% of sorafenib-treated patients. Grade 3 to 5 hepatic encephalopathy occurred in 5% of LENVIMA-treated patients and 2% of sorafenib-treated patients. Grade 3 to 5 hepatic failure occurred in 3% of LENVIMA-treated patients and 3% of sorafenib-treated patients. Two percent of patients discontinued LENVIMA and 0.2% discontinued sorafenib due to hepatic encephalopathy and 1% of patients discontinued lenvatinib or sorafenib due to hepatic failure [see Adverse   Reactions   (     6.1     )]   .  



 Monitor liver function prior to initiating LENVIMA, then every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, and at least monthly thereafter during treatment. Monitor patients with HCC closely for signs of hepatic failure, including hepatic encephalopathy. Withhold and resume at a reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue LENVIMA based on severity [   see   Dosage and Administration (     2.5     )   ]  .



     5.5        Renal Failure   or       Impairment  



  Serious including fatal renal failure or impairment can occur with LENVIMA. Renal impairment occurred in 14% of patients receiving LENVIMA in SELECT (DTC) and in 7% of patients receiving LENVIMA in REFLECT (HCC). Grade 3 to 5 renal failure or impairment occurred in 3% (DTC) and 2% (HCC) of patients, including 1 fatality in each study.



 In Study 205 (RCC), renal impairment or renal failure occurred in 18% of patients receiving LENVIMA with everolimus, including Grade 3 in 10% of patients  [see Adverse Reactions (     6.1     )]  .



 Initiate prompt management of diarrhea or dehydration/hypovolemia. Withhold and resume at a reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue LENVIMA for renal failure or impairment based on severity [   see    Dosage and Administration       (     2.5     )   ]  . 



     5.   6        Proteinuria  



  Proteinuria occurred in 34% of LENVIMA-treated patients in SELECT (DTC) and in 26% of LENVIMA-treated patients in REFLECT (HCC). Grade 3 proteinuria occurred in 11% and 6% in SELECT and REFLECT, respectively. In Study 205 (RCC), proteinuria occurred in 31% of patients receiving LENVIMA with everolimus and 14% of patients receiving everolimus. Grade 3 proteinuria occurred in 8% of patients receiving LENVIMA with everolimus compared to 2% of patients receiving everolimus  [see Adverse Reactions (     6.1     )]  .



 Monitor for proteinuria prior to initiating LENVIMA and periodically during treatment. If urine dipstick proteinuria greater than or equal to 2+ is detected, obtain a 24-hour urine protein. Withhold and resume at a reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue LENVIMA based on severity  [   see       Dosage and Administration   (     2.5     )   ]  .



     5.   7        Diarrhea  



  Of the 737 patients treated with LENVIMA in SELECT (DTC) and REFLECT (HCC), diarrhea occurred in 49% of patients, including Grade 3 in 6%.



 In Study 205 (RCC), diarrhea occurred in 81% of patients receiving LENVIMA with everolimus, including Grade 3 in 19%. Diarrhea was the most frequent cause of dose interruption/reduction and diarrhea recurred despite dose reduction  [see Adverse Reactions (     6.1     )]  .



 Promptly initiate management of diarrhea. Withhold and resume at a reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue LENVIMA based on severity  [   see   Dosage and Administration (     2.5     )   ]  .



     5.   8        Fistula Formation and   Gastrointestinal Perforation  



   Of 799 patients treated with LENVIMA or LENVIMA with everolimus in SELECT (DTC), Study 205 (RCC) and REFLECT (HCC), fistula or gastrointestinal perforation occurred in 2%.   



  Fistulas (e.g. gastrointestinal, bronchopleural, tracheo-oesophageal, oesophageal, cutaneous, pharyngeal, female genital tract fistula) and gastrointestinal perforations have also been reported in other lenvatinib clinical trials and in post-marketing experience. Pneumothorax has been reported with and without clear evidence of a bronchopleural fistula. Some reports of gastrointestinal perforation, fistula and pneumothorax occurred in association with tumor regression or necrosis. In most cases of fistula formation or gastrointestinal perforation, risk factors such as prior surgery or radiotherapy were present.  



  Permanently discontinue LENVIMA in patients who develop gastrointestinal perforation of any severity or Grade 3 or 4 fistula [see   Dosage and Administration   (     2.5     )].    



     5.   9        QT Interval Prolongation  



  In SELECT (DTC), QT/QTc interval prolongation occurred in 9% of LENVIMA-treated patients and QT interval prolongation of &gt;500 ms occurred in 2%. In Study 205 (RCC), QTc interval increases of &gt;60 ms occurred in 11% of patients receiving LENVIMA with everolimus and QTc interval &gt;500 ms occurred in 6%. In REFLECT (HCC), QTc interval increases of &gt;60 ms occurred in 8% of LENVIMA-treated patients and QTc interval &gt;500 ms occurred in 2%.



 Monitor and correct electrolyte abnormalities at baseline and periodically during treatment. Monitor electrocardiograms in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or those who are taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval, including Class Ia and III antiarrhythmics. Withhold and resume at reduced dose of LENVIMA upon recovery based on severity  [see   Dosage and Administration       (     2.5     )]  .



     5.   10        Hypocalcemia  



  In SELECT (DTC), Grade 3 to 4 hypocalcemia occurred in 9% of patients receiving LENVIMA. In 65% of cases, hypocalcemia improved or resolved following calcium supplementation, with or without dose interruption or dose reduction. 



 In Study 205 (RCC), Grade 3 to 4 hypocalcemia occurred in 6% of patients treated with LENVIMA with everolimus. In REFLECT (HCC), Grade 3 hypocalcemia occurred in 0.8% of LENVIMA-treated patients  [see Adverse Reactions (     6.1     )]  .



 Monitor blood calcium levels at least monthly and replace calcium as necessary during treatment. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue LENVIMA depending on severity [   see   Dosage and Administration       (     2.5     )   ]  .



     5.1   1        Reversible   Posterior Leukoe   ncephalopathy Syndrome  



  Across clinical studies of 1823 patients who received LENVIMA as a single agent  [see Adverse Reaction (     6.1     )]  , reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) occurred in 0.3%.



 Confirm the diagnosis of RPLS with magnetic resonance imaging. Withhold and resume at a reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue LENVIMA depending on severity and persistence of neurologic symptoms [see   Dosage and Administration   (     2.5     )]  .



     5.1   2        Hemorrhagic   E   vents  



  Serious including fatal hemorrhagic events can occur with LENVIMA. Across SELECT (DTC), Study 205 (RCC) and REFLECT (HCC), hemorrhagic events of any grade occurred in 29% of the 799 patients treated with LENVIMA as a single agent or in combination with everolimus. The most frequently reported hemorrhagic events (all grades and occurring in at least 5% of patients) were epistaxis and hematuria. 



 In SELECT, Grade 3 to 5 hemorrhage occurred in 2% of patients receiving LENVIMA, including 1 fatal intracranial hemorrhage among 16 patients who received LENVIMA and had CNS metastases at baseline. In Study 205, Grade 3 to 5 hemorrhage occurred in 8% of patients receiving LENVIMA with everolimus, including 1 fatal cerebral hemorrhage. In REFLECT, Grade 3 to 5 hemorrhage occurred in 5% of patients receiving LENVIMA, including 7 fatal hemorrhagic events [see Adverse Reactions (     6.1     )]  .



 Serious tumor related bleeds, including fatal hemorrhagic events, occurred in patients treated with LENVIMA in clinical trials and in the post-marketing setting. In post-marketing surveillance, serious and fatal carotid artery hemorrhages were seen more frequently in patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) than in other tumor types. The safety and effectiveness of LENVIMA in patients with ATC have not been demonstrated in clinical trials.



 Consider the risk of severe or fatal hemorrhage associated with tumor invasion or infiltration of major blood vessels (e.g. carotid artery). Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue LENVIMA based on the severity [see       Dosage and Administration       (     2.5     )   ]  .



     5.1   3        Impairment of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Suppression   /Thyroid Dysfunction      



  LENVIMA impairs exogenous thyroid suppression. In SELECT (DTC), 88% of all patients had a baseline thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level &lt;=0.5 mU/L. In those patients with a normal TSH at baseline, elevation of TSH level &gt;0.5 mU/L was observed post baseline in 57% of LENVIMA-treated patients.



 Grade 1 or 2 hypothyroidism occurred in 24% of patients receiving LENVIMA with everolimus in Study 205 (RCC) and in 21% of patients receiving LENVIMA in REFLECT (HCC). In those patients with a normal or low TSH at baseline, an elevation of TSH was observed post baseline in 70% of patients receiving LENVIMA in REFLECT and 60% of patients receiving LENVIMA with everolimus in Study 205  [see Adverse   Reactions   (     6.1     )]  .



 Monitor thyroid function prior to initiating LENVIMA and at least monthly during treatment. Treat hypothyroidism according to standard medical practice.



     5.14        Wound Healing Complications  



   Wound healing complications, including fistula formation and wound dehiscence, can occur with LENVIMA. Withhold LENVIMA for at least 6 days prior to scheduled surgery. Resume LENVIMA after surgery based on clinical judgment of adequate wound healing. Permanently discontinue LENVIMA in patients with wound healing complications.  



     5.   15        Embryo   -F   etal Toxicity  



  Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal reproduction studies, LENVIMA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of lenvatinib during organogenesis at doses below the recommended clinical doses resulted in embryotoxicity, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits.



 Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LENVIMA and for at least 30 days after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (     8.1     ,     8.3     )   ]  .
