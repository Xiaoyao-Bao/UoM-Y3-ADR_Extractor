  6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 MYDAYIS was studied in adults (18 to 55 years) and pediatric patients (13 to 17 years) who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4  th  or 5  th  editions (DSM-IV-TR  (r) or  DSM-5) criteria for ADHD. The safety data for adults were pooled from three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in doses of 12.5 mg to 75 mg per day (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage). Doses higher than 50 mg per day did not demonstrate additional clinical benefit and are not recommended.



 The safety data for pediatric patients (13 to 17 years) is from 1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of doses of 12.5 mg to 25 mg. The total exposure in patients treated with MYDAYIS totalled 704; this included pediatric patients, 78 adolescent patients and 626 adult patients from multiple well-controlled trials. The duration of use ranged from 4 to 7 weeks  [see  Clinical Studies (14)    ].



     Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation of Treatment  



 In pooled controlled trials of adult patients, 9% (54/626) of MYDAYIS-treated patients discontinued due to adverse reactions compared to 2% (7/328) of placebo-treated patients. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation (i.e. leading to discontinuation in at least 1% of MYDAYIS-treated patients and at a rate at least twice that of placebo) were insomnia (2%, n=15), blood pressure increased (2%, n=10), decreased appetite (1%, n=5), and headache (1%, n= 4).



 In a controlled trial including adolescent patients (13 to 17 years), 5% (4/78) of MYDAYIS-treated patients discontinued due to adverse reactions compared to 0% (0/79) of placebo-treated patients. The most frequent adverse reaction leading to discontinuation (i.e. leading to discontinuation in at least 1% of MYDAYIS-treated patients and at a rate at least twice that of placebo) were dizziness (1%, n=1), depression (1%, n=1), abdominal pain upper (1%, n=1), and viral infection (1%, n=1).



     Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of &gt;=2% and at Least Twice Placebo Among MYDAYIS-Treated Adults in Clinical Trials  



 The most common adverse reactions reported in adults were insomnia, decreased appetite, dry mouth, decreased weight, heart rate increased, and anxiety. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions that occurred &gt;=2% compared to placebo. The most common adverse reaction (insomnia) generally occurred early during treatment with MYDAYIS.

            6.2 Adverse Reactions Associated with the Use of Amphetamines
   The following adverse reactions have been associated with the use of amphetamines. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of amphetamines. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Cardiovascular  : Dyspnea, sudden death. There have been isolated reports of cardiomyopathy associated with chronic amphetamine use.



   Central Nervous System  : Psychotic episodes at recommended doses, overstimulation, restlessness, euphoria, dyskinesia, dysphoria, headache, tics, fatigue, aggression, anger, logorrhea, dermatillomania, and paresthesia (including formication).



   Eye Disorders:  Mydriasis.



   Gastrointestinal  : Unpleasant taste, constipation.



   Allergic  : Urticaria, rash, hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and anaphylaxis. Serious skin rashes, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported.



   Endocrine  : Impotence, changes in libido, frequent or prolonged erections.



   Skin  : Alopecia.



   Vascular Disorders  : Raynaud's phenomenon.



   Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders  : Rhabdomyolysis.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE

    WARNING: ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE  

    CNS stimulants, including MYDAYIS, other amphetamine-containing products, and methylphenidate, have a high potential for abuse and dependence. Assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing and monitor for signs of abuse and dependence while on therapy   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1  ,   9.3)  , and   Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2  ,   9.3)  ].    



   EXCERPT:   WARNING: ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE



   See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.  



 *  CNS stimulants, including MYDAYIS, other amphetamine -containing products, and methylphenidate, have a high potential for abuse and dependence (5.1, 9.3) 
 *  Assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing and monitor for signs of abuse and dependence while on therapy (9.2, 9.3) 
    
</Section>
    <Section id="S3" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *   Serious Cardiovascular Reactions: Sudden death has been reported in association with CNS stimulant treatment at recommended doses in pediatric patients with structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious heart problems. In adults, sudden death, stroke, and myocardial infarction have been reported. Avoid use in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart arrhythmia, or coronary artery disease. (  5.2  ) 
 *   Blood Pressure and Heart Rate Increases: Monitor blood pressure and pulse. Consider benefits and risks before use in patients for whom blood pressure increases may be problematic. (  5.3  ) 
 *   Psychiatric Adverse Reactions: May cause psychotic or manic symptoms in patients with no prior history, or exacerbation of symptoms in patients with pre-existing psychosis. Evaluate for bipolar disorder prior to stimulant use. (  5.4  ) 
 *   Long-Term Suppression of Growth: Monitor height and weight in pediatric patients during treatment. (  5.5  ) 
 *   Peripheral Vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon: Stimulants used to treat ADHD are associated with peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon. Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during treatment with ADHD stimulants. (  5.6  ) 
 *   Seizures: May lower the convulsive threshold. If a seizure occurs, discontinue MYDAYIS . (  5.7  ) 
 *   Serotonin Syndrome: Increased risk when co-administered with serotonergic agents (e.g., SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans), but also during overdosage situations. If it occurs, discontinue MYDAYIS and initiate supportive treatment. (  5.8  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Potential for Abuse and Dependence



  CNS stimulants, including MYDAYIS, other amphetamine-containing products, and methylphenidate, have a high potential for abuse and dependence. Assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing, and monitor for signs of abuse and dependence while on therapy [see  Boxed Warning  ,  Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2  ,  9.3)  ]  .



    5.2 Serious Cardiovascular Reactions



  Sudden death, stroke and myocardial infarction have been reported in adults with CNS stimulant treatment at recommended doses. Sudden death has been reported in pediatric patients with structural cardiac abnormalities and other serious heart problems while taking CNS stimulants at recommended doses for ADHD. Avoid use in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, and other serious heart problems. Further evaluate patients who develop exertional chest pain, unexplained syncope, or arrhythmias during MYDAYIS treatment.



    5.3 Blood Pressure and Heart Rate Increases



  CNS stimulants cause an increase in blood pressure (mean increase about 2-4 mm Hg) and heart rate (mean increase about 3-6 bpm). Monitor all patients for potential tachycardia and hypertension [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



    5.4 Psychiatric Adverse Reactions



   Exacerbation of Pre-existing Psychosis  



 CNS stimulants may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder in patients with a pre-existing psychotic disorder.



    Induction of a Manic Episode in Patients with Bipolar Disorder  



 CNS stimulants may induce a mixed/manic episode in patients with bipolar disorder. Prior to initiating treatment, screen patients for risk factors for developing a manic episode (e.g., comorbid or history of depressive symptoms or a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression).



    New Psychotic or Manic Symptoms  



 CNS stimulants, at recommended doses, may cause psychotic or manic symptoms, e.g., hallucinations, delusional thinking, or mania in patients without a prior history of psychotic illness or mania. If such symptoms occur, consider discontinuing MYDAYIS. In a pooled analysis of multiple short-term, placebo-controlled studies of CNS stimulants, psychotic or manic symptoms occurred in 0.1% of CNS stimulant-treated patients compared to 0% in placebo-treated patients.



    5.5 Long-Term Suppression of Growth



  CNS stimulants have been associated with weight loss and slowing of growth rate in pediatric patients. Closely monitor growth (weight and height) in pediatric patients treated with CNS stimulants, including MYDAYIS. In a 4-week, placebo-controlled trial of MYDAYIS in patients ages 6 to 17 years old with ADHD, there was a decrease in weight in the MYDAYIS groups compared to weight gain in the placebo group [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



 Patients who are not growing or gaining weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted. MYDAYIS is not approved for use in pediatric patients 12 years and younger [Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].  



    5.6 Peripheral Vasculopathy, including Raynaud's Phenomenon



  Stimulants, including MYDAYIS, used to treat ADHD are associated with peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon. Signs and symptoms are usually intermittent and mild; however, very rare sequelae include digital ulceration and/or soft tissue breakdown. Effects of peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon, were observed in post-marketing reports at different times and at therapeutic doses in all age groups throughout the course of treatment. Signs and symptoms generally improve after reduction in dose or discontinuation of drug. Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during treatment with ADHD stimulants. Further clinical evaluation (e.g., rheumatology referral) may be appropriate for certain patients.



    5.7 Seizures



  MYDAYIS may lower the convulsive threshold in patients with prior history of seizure, in patients with prior EEG abnormalities in the absence of seizures, and in patients without a history of seizures and no prior EEG evidence of seizures. In the presence of seizures, MYDAYIS should be discontinued.



    5.8 Serotonin Syndrome



  Serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening reaction, may occur when amphetamines are used in combination with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John's Wort [see  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ].  The co-administration with cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) inhibitors may also increase the risk with increased exposure to MYDAYIS. In these situations, consider an alternative non-serotonergic drug or an alternative drug that does not inhibit CYP2D6 [see  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ].  



 Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).



 Concomitant use of MYDAYIS with MAOI drugs is contraindicated [see  Contraindications (4)  ]  .



 Discontinue treatment with MYDAYIS and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of MYDAYIS with other serotonergic drugs or CYP2D6 inhibitors is clinically warranted, initiate MYDAYIS with lower doses, monitor patients for the emergence of serotonin syndrome during drug initiation or titration, and inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome.



    5.9 Potential for Overdose Due to Medication Errors



  Medication errors, including substitution and dispensing errors, between MYDAYIS and other amphetamine products could occur, leading to possible overdosage. To avoid substitution errors and overdosage, do not substitute for other amphetamine products on a milligram-per-milligram basis because of different amphetamine base compositions and differing pharmacokinetic profiles [see  Dosage and Administration (2.7)  and  Overdosage (10)  ]  .
