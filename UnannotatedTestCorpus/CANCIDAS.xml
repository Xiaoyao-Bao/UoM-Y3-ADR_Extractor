    <Section id="S1" name="adverse reactions">    6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

  The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in detail in another section of the labeling:



 *  Hypersensitivity [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  
 *  Hepatic Effects [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]  
 *  Elevated Liver Enzymes During Concomitant Use With Cyclosporine [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  
   *   Adults: Most common adverse reactions (incidence 10% or greater) are diarrhea, pyrexia, ALT/AST increased, blood alkaline phosphatase increased, and blood potassium decreased. (  6.1  ) 
 *   Pediatric Patients: Most common adverse reactions (incidence &gt;=10%) are pyrexia, diarrhea, rash, ALT/AST increased, blood potassium decreased, hypotension, and chills. (  6.1  )

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of CANCIDAS cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



       Clinical Trials Experience in Adults    



 The overall safety of CANCIDAS was assessed in 1865 adult individuals who received single or multiple doses of CANCIDAS: 564 febrile, neutropenic patients (empirical therapy study); 382 patients with candidemia and/or intra-abdominal abscesses, peritonitis, or pleural space infections (including 4 patients with chronic disseminated candidiasis); 297 patients with esophageal and/or oropharyngeal candidiasis; 228 patients with invasive aspergillosis; and 394 individuals in phase I studies. In the empirical therapy study patients had undergone hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation or chemotherapy. In the studies involving patients with documented  Candida  infections, the majority of the patients had serious underlying medical conditions (e.g., hematologic or other malignancy, recent major surgery, HIV) requiring multiple concomitant medications. Patients in the noncomparative  Aspergillus  studies often had serious predisposing medical conditions (e.g., bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplants, hematologic malignancy, solid tumors or organ transplants) requiring multiple concomitant medications.



       Empirical Therapy for Presumed Fungal Infections in Febrile Neutropenic Patients    



 In the randomized, double-blinded empirical therapy study, patients received either CANCIDAS 50 mg/day (following a 70-mg loading dose) or AmBisome  (r)  (amphotericin B liposome for injection, 3 mg/kg/day). In this study clinical or laboratory hepatic adverse reactions were reported in 39% and 45% of patients in the CANCIDAS and AmBisome groups, respectively. Also reported was an isolated, serious adverse reaction of hyperbilirubinemia. Adverse reactions occurring in 7.5% or greater of the patients in either treatment group are presented in Table 2.

         The proportion of patients who experienced an infusion-related adverse reaction (defined as a systemic event, such as pyrexia, chills, flushing, hypotension, hypertension, tachycardia, dyspnea, tachypnea, rash, or anaphylaxis, that developed during the study therapy infusion and one hour following infusion) was significantly lower in the group treated with CANCIDAS (35%) than in the group treated with AmBisome (52%).
 

 To evaluate the effect of CANCIDAS and AmBisome on renal function, nephrotoxicity was defined as doubling of serum creatinine relative to baseline or an increase of greater than or equal to 1 mg/dL in serum creatinine if baseline serum creatinine was above the upper limit of the normal range. Among patients whose baseline creatinine clearance was greater than 30 mL/min, the incidence of nephrotoxicity was significantly lower in the group treated with CANCIDAS (3%) than in the group treated with AmBisome (12%).



       Candidemia and Other Candida Infections    



 In the randomized, double-blinded invasive candidiasis study, patients received either CANCIDAS 50 mg/day (following a 70-mg loading dose) or amphotericin B 0.6 to 1 mg/kg/day. Adverse reactions occurring in 10% or greater of the patients in either treatment group are presented in Table 3.

 To evaluate the effect of CANCIDAS and amphotericin B on renal function, nephrotoxicity was defined as doubling of serum creatinine relative to baseline or an increase of greater than or equal to 1 mg/dL in serum creatinine if baseline serum creatinine was above the upper limit of the normal range. In a subgroup of patients whose baseline creatinine clearance was greater than 30 mL/min, the incidence of nephrotoxicity was significantly lower in the group treated with CANCIDAS than in the group treated with amphotericin B.



 In a second randomized, double-blinded invasive candidiasis study, patients received either CANCIDAS 50 mg/day (following a 70-mg loading dose) or CANCIDAS 150 mg/day. The proportion of patients who experienced any adverse reaction was similar in the 2 treatment groups; however, this study was not large enough to detect differences in rare or unexpected adverse reactions. Adverse reactions occurring in 5% or greater of the patients in either treatment group are presented in Table 4.

               Invasive Aspergillosis    
 

 In an open-label, noncomparative aspergillosis study, in which 69 patients received CANCIDAS (70-mg loading dose on Day 1 followed by 50 mg daily), the following adverse reactions were observed with an incidence of 12.5% or greater: blood alkaline phosphatase increased (22%), hypotension (20%), respiratory failure (20%), pyrexia (17%), diarrhea (15%), nausea (15%), headache (15%), rash (13%), alanine aminotransferase increased (13%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (13%), blood bilirubin increased (13%), and blood potassium decreased (13%). Also reported in this patient population were pulmonary edema, ARDS (adult respiratory distress syndrome), and radiographic infiltrates.



       Clinical Trials Experience in Pediatric Patients (3 months to 17 years of age)    



 The overall safety of CANCIDAS was assessed in 171 pediatric patients who received single or multiple doses of CANCIDAS. The distribution among the 153 pediatric patients who were over the age of 3 months was as follows: 104 febrile, neutropenic patients; 38 patients with candidemia and/or intra-abdominal abscesses, peritonitis, or pleural space infections; 1 patient with esophageal candidiasis; and 10 patients with invasive aspergillosis. The overall safety profile of CANCIDAS in pediatric patients is comparable to that in adult patients. Table 6 shows the incidence of adverse reactions reported in 7.5% or greater of pediatric patients in clinical studies.



 One patient (0.6%) receiving CANCIDAS, and three patients (12%) receiving AmBisome developed a serious drug-related adverse reaction. Two patients (1%) were discontinued from CANCIDAS and three patients (12%) were discontinued from AmBisome due to a drug-related adverse reaction. The proportion of patients who experienced an infusion-related adverse reaction (defined as a systemic event, such as pyrexia, chills, flushing, hypotension, hypertension, tachycardia, dyspnea, tachypnea, rash, or anaphylaxis, that developed during the study therapy infusion and one hour following infusion) was 22% in the group treated with CANCIDAS and 35% in the group treated with AmBisome.

                Overall Safety Experience of CANCIDAS in Clinical Trials    
 

 The overall safety of CANCIDAS was assessed in 2036 individuals (including 1642 adult or pediatric patients and 394 volunteers) from 34 clinical studies. These individuals received single or multiple (once daily) doses of CANCIDAS, ranging from 5 mg to 210 mg. Full safety data is available from 1951 individuals, as the safety data from 85 patients enrolled in 2 compassionate use studies was limited solely to serious adverse reactions. Adverse reactions which occurred in 5% or greater of all individuals who received CANCIDAS in these trials are shown in Table 7.



 Overall, 1665 of the 1951 (85%) patients/volunteers who received CANCIDAS experienced an adverse reaction.

      6.2 Postmarketing Experience
   The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during the post-approval use of CANCIDAS. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 *   Gastrointestinal disorders: pancreatitis 
 *   Hepatobiliary disorders: hepatic necrosis 
 *   Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and skin exfoliation 
 *   Renal and urinary disorders: clinically significant renal dysfunction 
 *   General disorders and administration site conditions  : swelling and peripheral edema 
 *   Laboratory abnormalities: gamma-glutamyltransferase increased

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *   Hypersensitivity : Anaphylaxis, possible histamine-mediated adverse reactions, including rash, facial swelling, angioedema, pruritus, sensation of warmth or bronchospasm, and cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported with use of CANCIDAS. Discontinue CANCIDAS at the first sign or symptom of a hypersensitivity reaction and administer appropriate treatment. (  5.1  ) 
 *   Hepatic Effects: Can cause abnormalities in liver enzymes. Isolated cases of hepatic dysfunction, hepatitis, or hepatic failure have been reported. Monitor patients who develop abnormal liver enzymes for evidence of worsening hepatic function, and evaluate risk/benefit of continuing CANCIDAS. (  5.2  ) 
 *   Elevated Liver Enzymes During Concomitant Use with Cyclosporine : Limit use to patients for whom potential benefit outweighs potential risk. Monitor patients who develop abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) during concomitant use with CANCIDAS. (  5.3  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Hypersensitivity



  Anaphylaxis and other hypersensitivity reactions have been reported during administration of CANCIDAS.



 Possible histamine-mediated adverse reactions, including rash, facial swelling, angioedema, pruritus, sensation of warmth or bronchospasm have been reported.



 Cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), some with a fatal outcome, have been reported with use of CANCIDAS [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ]  .



 Discontinue CANCIDAS at the first sign or symptom of a hypersensitivity reaction and administer appropriate treatment.



    5.2 Hepatic Effects



  Laboratory abnormalities in liver function tests have been seen in healthy volunteers and in adult and pediatric patients treated with CANCIDAS. In some adult and pediatric patients with serious underlying conditions who were receiving multiple concomitant medications with CANCIDAS, isolated cases of clinically significant hepatic dysfunction, hepatitis, and hepatic failure have been reported; a causal relationship to CANCIDAS has not been established. Monitor patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during CANCIDAS therapy for evidence of worsening hepatic function and evaluated for risk/benefit of continuing CANCIDAS therapy.



    5.3 Elevated Liver Enzymes During Concomitant Use With Cyclosporine



  Elevated liver enzymes have occurred in patients receiving CANCIDAS and cyclosporine concomitantly. Only use CANCIDAS and cyclosporine in those patients for whom the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk. Patients who develop abnormal liver enzymes during concomitant therapy should be monitored and the risk/benefit of continuing therapy should be evaluated.
