  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed cannot be directly compared to rates in other trials and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



     Monotherapy    



     Comparison of FASLODEX 500 mg and FASLODEX 250 mg (CONFIRM)    



 The following adverse reactions (ARs) were calculated based on the safety analysis of CONFIRM comparing the administration of FASLODEX 500 mg intramuscularly once a month with FASLODEX 250 mg intramuscularly once a month. The most frequently reported adverse reactions in the FASLODEX 500 mg group were injection site pain (11.6% of patients), nausea (9.7% of patients), and bone pain (9.4% of patients); the most frequently reported adverse reactions in the FASLODEX 250 mg group were nausea (13.6% of patients), back pain (10.7% of patients), and injection site pain (9.1% of patients).



 Table 1 lists adverse reactions reported with an incidence of 5% or greater, regardless of assessed causality, from CONFIRM.

         In the pooled safety population (N=1127) from clinical trials comparing FASLODEX 500 mg to FASLODEX 250 mg, post-baseline increases of &gt;=1 CTC grade in either AST, ALT, or alkaline phosphatase were observed in &gt;15% of patients receiving FASLODEX. Grade 3-4 increases were observed in 1-2% of patients. The incidence and severity of increased hepatic enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP) did not differ between the 250 mg and the 500 mg FASLODEX arms.
 

     Comparison of FASLODEX 500 mg and Anastrozole 1 mg (FALCON)    



 The safety of FASLODEX 500 mg versus anastrozole 1 mg was evaluated in FALCON. The data described below reflect exposure to FASLODEX in 228 out of 460 patients with HR-positive advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women not previously treated with endocrine therapy who received at least one (1) dose of treatment in FALCON.



 Permanent discontinuation associated with an adverse reaction occurred in 4 of 228 (1.8%) patients receiving FASLODEX and in 3 of 232 (1.3%) patients receiving anastrozole. Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation for those patients receiving FASLODEX included drug hypersensitivity (0.9%), injection site hypersensitivity (0.4%), and elevated liver enzymes (0.4%).



 The most common adverse reactions (&gt;=10%) of any grade reported in patients in the FASLODEX arm were arthralgia, hot flash, fatigue, and nausea.



 Adverse reactions reported in patients who received FASLODEX in FALCON at an incidence of &gt;=5% in either treatment arm are listed in Table 2, and laboratory abnormalities are listed in Table 3.

The data described below reflect exposure to FASLODEX plus palbociclib in 345 out of 517 patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer who received at least 1 dose of treatment in PALOMA-3. The median duration of treatment for FASLODEX plus palbociclib was 10.8 months while the median duration of treatment for FASLODEX plus placebo arm was 4.8 months.



 No dose reduction was allowed for FASLODEX in PALOMA-3. Dose reductions of palbociclib due to an adverse reaction of any grade occurred in 36% of patients receiving FASLODEX plus palbociclib.



 Permanent discontinuation associated with an adverse reaction occurred in 19 of 345 (6%) patients receiving FASLODEX plus palbociclib, and in 6 of 172 (3%) patients receiving FASLODEX plus placebo. Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation for those patients receiving FASLODEX plus palbociclib included fatigue (0.6%), infections (0.6%), and thrombocytopenia (0.6%).



 The most common adverse reactions (&gt;=10%) of any grade reported in patients in the FASLODEX plus palbociclib arm by descending frequency were neutropenia, leukopenia, infections, fatigue, nausea, anemia, stomatitis, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, alopecia, rash, decreased appetite, and pyrexia.



 The most frequently reported Grade &gt;=3 adverse reactions (&gt;=5%) in patients receiving FASLODEX plus palbociclib in descending frequency were neutropenia and leukopenia.



 Adverse reactions (&gt;=10%) reported in patients who received FASLODEX plus palbociclib or FASLODEX plus placebo in PALOMA-3 are listed in Table 5, and laboratory abnormalities are listed in Table 6.

     Combination Therapy with Abemaciclib (MONARCH 2)    



 The safety of FASLODEX (500 mg) plus abemaciclib (150 mg twice daily) versus FASLODEX plus placebo was evaluated in MONARCH 2. The data described below reflect exposure to FASLODEX in 664 patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who received at least one dose of FASLODEX plus abemaciclib or placebo in MONARCH 2.



 Median duration of treatment was 12 months for patients receiving FASLODEX plus abemaciclib and 8 months for patients receiving FASLODEX plus placebo.



 Dose reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 43% of patients receiving FASLODEX plus abemaciclib. Adverse reactions leading to dose reductions &gt;=5% of patients were diarrhea and neutropenia. Abemaciclib dose reduction due to diarrhea of any grade occurred in 19% of patients receiving FASLODEX plus abemaciclib compared to 0.4% of patients receiving FASLODEX plus placebo. Abemaciclib dose reductions due to neutropenia of any grade occurred in 10% of patients receiving FASLODEX plus abemaciclib compared to no patients receiving FASLODEX plus placebo.



 Permanent study treatment discontinuation due to an adverse event was reported in 9% of patients receiving FASLODEX plus abemaciclib and in 3% of patients receiving FASLODEX plus placebo. Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation for patients receiving FASLODEX plus abemaciclib were infection (2%), diarrhea (1%), hepatotoxicity (1%), fatigue (0.7%), nausea (0.2%), abdominal pain (0.2%), acute kidney injury (0.2%), and cerebral infarction (0.2%).



 Deaths during treatment or during the 30-day follow up, regardless of causality, were reported in 18 cases (4%) of FASLODEX plus abemaciclib treated patients versus 10 cases (5%) of FASLODEX plus placebo treated patients. Causes of death for patients receiving FASLODEX plus abemaciclib included: 7 (2%) patient deaths due to underlying disease, 4 (0.9%) due to sepsis, 2 (0.5%) due to pneumonitis, 2 (0.5%) due to hepatotoxicity, and one (0.2%) due to cerebral infarction.



 The most common adverse reactions reported (&gt;=20%) in the FASLODEX plus abemaciclib arm were diarrhea, fatigue, neutropenia, nausea, infections, abdominal pain, anemia, leukopenia, decreased appetite, vomiting, and headache (Table 7). The most frequently reported (&gt;=5%) Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were neutropenia, diarrhea, leukopenia, anemia, and infections.

   EXCERPT:    *    Risk of Bleeding: Use with caution in patients with bleeding diatheses, thrombocytopenia, or anticoagulant use.  (5.1)   
 *    Increased Exposure in Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Use a 250 mg dose for patients with moderate hepatic impairment. (  2.2  ,  5.2  ,  8.6  ) 
 *    Injection Site Reaction: Use caution while administering FASLODEX at the dorsogluteal injection site due to the proximity of the underlying sciatic nerve.  (5.3)   
 *    Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. (  5.4  ,  8.1  ,  8.3  ) 
 *    Immunoassay Measurement of Serum Estradiol: FASLODEX can interfere with estradiol measurement by immunoassay, resulting in falsely elevated estradiol levels.  (5.5)   
    
 

   5.1 Risk of Bleeding



  Because FASLODEX is administered intramuscularly, it should be used with caution in patients with bleeding diatheses, thrombocytopenia, or anticoagulant use.



    5.2 Increased Exposure in Patients with Hepatic Impairment



  The safety and pharmacokinetics of FASLODEX were evaluated in a study in seven subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B) and seven subjects with normal hepatic function. Exposure was increased in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, therefore, a dose of 250 mg is recommended [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ].  



 FASLODEX has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.6)  ].  



    5.3 Injection Site Reaction



  Injection site related events including sciatica, neuralgia, neuropathic pain, and peripheral neuropathy have been reported with FASLODEX injection. Caution should be taken while administering FASLODEX at the dorsogluteal injection site due to the proximity of the underlying sciatic nerve [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



    5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, FASLODEX can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of fulvestrant to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis resulted in embryo-fetal toxicity at daily doses that are significantly less than the maximum recommended human dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with FASLODEX and for one year after the last dose [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ,  (8.3)  , and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)  ]  .



    5.5 Immunoassay Measurement of Serum Estradiol



  Due to structural similarity of fulvestrant and estradiol, FASLODEX can interfere with estradiol measurement by immunoassay, resulting in falsely elevated estradiol levels.
