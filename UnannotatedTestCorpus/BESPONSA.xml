  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The adverse reactions described in this section reflect exposure to BESPONSA in 164 patients with relapsed or refractory ALL who participated in a randomized clinical study of BESPONSA versus Investigator's choice of chemotherapy (fludarabine + cytarabine + granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [FLAG], mitoxantrone + cytarabine [MXN/Ara-C], or high dose cytarabine [HIDAC]) (INO-VATE ALL Trial [NCT01564784])  [see  Clinical Studies (14)  ]  .



 Of the 164 patients who received BESPONSA, the median age was 47 years (range: 18-78 years), 56% were male, 68% had received 1 prior treatment regimen for ALL, 31% had received 2 prior treatment regimens for ALL, 68% were White, 19% were Asian, and 2% were Black.



 In patients who received BESPONSA, the median duration of treatment was 8.9 weeks (range: 0.1-26.4 weeks), with a median of 3 treatment cycles started in each patient. In patients who received Investigator's choice of chemotherapy, the median duration of treatment was 0.9 weeks (range: 0.1-15.6 weeks), with a median of 1 treatment cycle started in each patient.



 In patients who received BESPONSA, the most common (&gt;= 20%) adverse reactions were thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, infection, anemia, leukopenia, fatigue, hemorrhage, pyrexia, nausea, headache, febrile neutropenia, transaminases increased, abdominal pain, gamma-glutamyltransferase increased, and hyperbilirubinemia.



 In patients who received BESPONSA, the most common (&gt;= 2%) serious adverse reactions were infection, febrile neutropenia, hemorrhage, abdominal pain, pyrexia, VOD, and fatigue.



 In patients who received BESPONSA, the most common (&gt;= 2%) adverse reactions reported as the reason for permanent discontinuation were infection (6%), thrombocytopenia (2%), hyperbilirubinemia (2%), transaminases increased (2%), and hemorrhage (2%); the most common (&gt;= 5%) adverse reactions reported as the reason for dosing interruption were neutropenia (17%), infection (10%), thrombocytopenia (10%), transaminases increased (6%), and febrile neutropenia (5%); and the most common (&gt;= 1%) adverse reactions reported as the reason for dose reduction were neutropenia (1%), thrombocytopenia (1%), and transaminases increased (1%).



 VOD was reported in 23/164 patients (14%) who received BESPONSA during or following treatment or following a HSCT after completion of treatment  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ].  



 Table 6 shows the adverse reactions with &gt;= 10% incidence reported in patients with relapsed or refractory ALL who received BESPONSA or Investigator's choice of chemotherapy.

               6.2 Immunogenicity
   As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to inotuzumab ozogamicin in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading.



 In clinical studies of BESPONSA in patients with relapsed or refractory ALL, the immunogenicity of BESPONSA was evaluated using an electrochemiluminescence (ECL)-based immunoassay to test for anti-inotuzumab ozogamicin antibodies. For patients whose sera tested positive for anti-inotuzumab ozogamicin antibodies, a cell-based luminescence assay was performed to detect neutralizing antibodies.



 In clinical studies of BESPONSA in patients with relapsed or refractory ALL, 7/236 patients (3%) tested positive for anti-inotuzumab ozogamicin antibodies. No patients tested positive for neutralizing anti-inotuzumab ozogamicin antibodies. In patients who tested positive for anti-inotuzumab ozogamicin antibodies, the presence of anti-inotuzumab ozogamicin antibodies did not affect clearance following BESPONSA treatment.

   See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.  



 *  Hepatotoxicity, including fatal and life-threatening VOD occurred in patients who received BESPONSA. (5.1) 
 *  A higher post-HSCT non-relapse mortality rate occurred in patients receiving BESPONSA (5.2) 
    
 

    HEPATOTOXICITY, INCLUDING VOD  



 *  Hepatotoxicity, including fatal and life-threatening VOD occurred in patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who received BESPONSA. The risk of VOD was greater in patients who underwent HSCT after BESPONSA treatment; use of HSCT conditioning regimens containing 2 alkylating agents and last total bilirubin level &gt;= upper limit of normal (ULN) before HSCT were significantly associated with an increased risk of VOD. 
 *  Other risk factors for VOD in patients treated with BESPONSA included ongoing or prior liver disease, prior HSCT, increased age, later salvage lines, and a greater number of BESPONSA treatment cycles. 
 *  Elevation of liver tests may require dosing interruption, dose reduction, or permanent discontinuation of BESPONSA. Permanently discontinue treatment if VOD occurs. If severe VOD occurs, treat according to standard medical practice [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 
        INCREASED RISK OF POST-HSCT NON-RELAPSE MORTALITY  
 

 *  There was higher post-HSCT non-relapse mortality rate in patients receiving BESPONSA, resulting in a higher Day 100 post-HSCT mortality rate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

   5.1 Hepatotoxicity, Including Hepatic Veno-occlusive Disease (VOD) (also known as Sinusoidal Obstruction Syndrome)



  In the INO-VATE ALL trial, hepatotoxicity, including severe, life-threatening, and sometimes fatal hepatic VOD was observed in 23/164 patients (14%) in the BESPONSA arm during or following treatment or following a HSCT after completion of treatment. VOD was reported up to 56 days after the last dose during treatment or during follow-up without an intervening HSCT. The median time from subsequent HSCT to onset of VOD was 15 days (range: 3-57 days). In the BESPONSA arm, among the 79 patients who proceeded to a subsequent HSCT, VOD was reported in 18/79 patients (23%), and among all 164 patients treated, VOD was reported in 5/164 patients (3%) during study therapy or in follow-up without an intervening HSCT.



 The risk of VOD was greater in patients who underwent HSCT after BESPONSA treatment; use of HSCT conditioning regimens containing 2 alkylating agents (e.g., busulfan in combination with other alkylating agents) and last total bilirubin level greater than or equal to the ULN before HSCT are significantly associated with an increased risk of VOD. Other risk factors for VOD in patients treated with BESPONSA included ongoing or prior liver disease, prior HSCT, increased age, later salvage lines, and a greater number of BESPONSA treatment cycles. Patients who have experienced prior VOD or have serious ongoing hepatic liver disease (e.g., cirrhosis, nodular regenerative hyperplasia, active hepatitis) are at an increased risk for worsening of liver disease, including developing VOD, following treatment with BESPONSA.



 Monitor closely for signs and symptoms of VOD; these may include elevations in total bilirubin, hepatomegaly (which may be painful), rapid weight gain, and ascites. Due to the risk of VOD, for patients proceeding to HSCT, the recommended duration of treatment with BESPONSA is 2 cycles; a third cycle may be considered for those patients who do not achieve a CR or CRi and MRD negativity after 2 cycles [see  Dosage and Administration (2.1)  ]  . For patients who proceed to HSCT, monitor liver tests closely during the first month post-HSCT, then less frequently thereafter, according to standard medical practice.



 In the INO-VATE ALL trial, increases in liver tests were reported. Grade 3/4 AST, ALT, and total bilirubin abnormal liver tests occurred in 7/160 (4%), 7/161 (4%), and 8/161 patients (5%), respectively.



 In all patients, monitor liver tests, including ALT, AST, total bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase, prior to and following each dose of BESPONSA. Elevations of liver tests may require dosing interruption, dose reduction, or permanent discontinuation of BESPONSA [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .



    5.2 Increased Risk of Post-Transplant Non-Relapse Mortality



  In the INO-VATE ALL trial, a higher post-HSCT non-relapse mortality rate was observed in patients receiving BESPONSA compared to the Investigator's choice of chemotherapy arm, resulting in a higher Day 100 post-HSCT mortality rate.



 Overall, 79/164 patients (48%) in the BESPONSA arm and 35/162 patients (22%) in the Investigator's choice of chemotherapy arm had a follow-up HSCT. The post-HSCT non-relapse mortality rate was 31/79 (39%) and 8/35 (23%) in the BESPONSA arm compared to the Investigator's choice of chemotherapy arm, respectively.



 In the BESPONSA arm, the most common causes of post-HSCT non-relapse mortality included VOD and infections. Five of the 18 VOD events that occurred post-HSCT were fatal. In the BESPONSA arm, among patients with ongoing VOD at time of death, 6 patients died due to multiorgan failure (MOF) or infection (3 patients died due to MOF, 2 patients died due to infection, and 1 patient died due to MOF and infection).



 Monitor closely for toxicities post-HSCT, including signs and symptoms of infection and VOD [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1  ,  5.3)  ]  .



    5.3 Myelosuppression



  In the INO-VATE ALL trial, myelosuppression was observed in patients receiving BESPONSA [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



 Thrombocytopenia and neutropenia were reported in 83/164 patients (51%) and 81/164 patients (49%), respectively. Grade 3 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia were reported in 23/164 patients (14%) and 33/164 patients (20%), respectively. Grade 4 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia were reported in 46/164 patients (28%) and 45/164 patients (27%), respectively. Febrile neutropenia, which may be life-threatening, was reported in 43/164 patients (26%). For patients who were in CR or CRi at the end of treatment, the recovery of platelet counts to &gt; 50,000/mm  3  was later than 45 days after the last dose in 15/164 patients (9%) who received BESPONSA and 3/162 patients (2%) who received Investigator's choice of chemotherapy.



 Complications associated with myelosuppression (including infections and bleeding/hemorrhagic events) were observed in patients receiving BESPONSA [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Infections, including serious infections, some of which were life-threatening or fatal, were reported in 79/164 patients (48%). Fatal infections, including pneumonia, neutropenic sepsis, sepsis, septic shock, and pseudomonal sepsis, were reported in 8/164 patients (5%). Bacterial, viral, and fungal infections were reported.



 Hemorrhagic events were reported in 54/164 patients (33%). Grade 3 or 4 hemorrhagic events were reported in 8/164 patients (5%). One Grade 5 (fatal) hemorrhagic event (intra-abdominal hemorrhage) was reported in 1/164 patients (1%). The most common hemorrhagic event was epistaxis which was reported in 24/164 patients (15%).



 Monitor complete blood counts prior to each dose of BESPONSA and monitor for signs and symptoms of infection, bleeding/hemorrhage, or other effects of myelosuppression during treatment with BESPONSA. As appropriate, administer prophylactic anti-infectives and employ surveillance testing during and after treatment with BESPONSA. Management of severe infection, bleeding/hemorrhage, or other effects of myelosuppression, including severe neutropenia or thrombocytopenia, may require dosing interruption, dose reduction, or permanent discontinuation of BESPONSA [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ].  



    5.4 Infusion Related Reactions



  In the INO-VATE ALL trial, infusion related reactions were observed in patients who received BESPONSA. Infusion related reactions (all Grade 2) were reported in 4/164 patients (2%). Infusion related reactions generally occurred in Cycle 1 shortly after the end of the BESPONSA infusion and resolved spontaneously or with medical management.



 Premedicate with a corticosteroid, antipyretic, and antihistamine prior to dosing [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  .



 Monitor patients closely during and for at least 1 hour after the end of infusion for the potential onset of infusion related reactions, including symptoms such as fever, chills, rash, or breathing problems. Interrupt infusion and institute appropriate medical management if an infusion related reaction occurs. Depending on the severity of the infusion related reaction, consider discontinuation of the infusion or administration of steroids and antihistamines. For severe or life-threatening infusion reactions, permanently discontinue BESPONSA [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .



    5.5 QT Interval Prolongation



  In the INO-VATE ALL trial, increases in QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) of &gt;= to 60 msec from baseline were measured in 4/162 patients (3%). No patients had QTcF values greater than 500 msec [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)  ]  . Grade 2 QT prolongation was reported in 2/164 patients (1%). No &gt;= Grade 3 QT prolongation or events of Torsade de Pointes were reported [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



 Administer BESPONSA with caution in patients who have a history of or predisposition for QTc prolongation, who are taking medicinal products that are known to prolong QT interval [see  Drug Interactions (7)  ]  , and in patients with electrolyte disturbances [see  Drug Interactions (7)  ].  Obtain electrocardiograms (ECGs) and electrolytes prior to the start of treatment, after initiation of any drug known to prolong QTc, and periodically monitor as clinically indicated during treatment [see  Drug Interactions (7)  ,  Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)  ]  ).



    5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies, BESPONSA can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal studies, inotuzumab ozogamicin caused embryo-fetal toxicities, starting at a dose that was approximately 0.4 times the exposure in patients at the maximum recommended dose, based on the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC). Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with BESPONSA and for at least 8 months after the final dose of BESPONSA. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with BESPONSA and for at least 5 months after the last dose of BESPONSA. Apprise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise women to contact their healthcare provider if they become pregnant or if pregnancy is suspected during treatment with BESPONSA [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1  ,  8.3)    ,   Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)  ,  Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)  ].
