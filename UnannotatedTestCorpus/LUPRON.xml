  Clinical Trials

  In the majority of patients testosterone levels increased above baseline during the first week, declining thereafter to baseline levels or below by the end of the second week of treatment. This transient increase was occasionally associated with a temporary worsening of signs and symptoms, usually manifested by an increase in bone pain (see    WARNINGS    section). In a few cases a temporary worsening of existing hematuria and urinary tract obstruction occurred during the first week. Temporary weakness and paresthesia of the lower limbs have been reported in a few cases.



 Potential exacerbations of signs and symptoms during the first few weeks of treatment is a concern in patients with vertebral metastases and/or urinary obstruction which, if aggravated, may lead to neurological problems or increase the obstruction.



 In a comparative trial of LUPRON INJECTION (leuprolide acetate) versus DES, in 5% or more of the patients receiving either drug, the following adverse reactions were reported to have a possible or probable relationship to drug as ascribed by the treating physician. Often, causality is difficult to assess in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Reactions considered not drug related are excluded.

   Postmarketing

  During postmarketing surveillance which includes other dosage forms and other patient populations, the following adverse events were reported.



 Symptoms consistent with an anaphylactoid or asthmatic process have been rarely (incidence rate of about 0.002%) reported. Rash, urticaria, and photosensitivity reactions have also been reported.



 Localized reactions including induration and abscess have been reported at the site of injection.



 Symptoms consistent with fibromyalgia (e.g., joint and muscle pain, headaches, sleep disorders, gastrointestinal distress, and shortness of breath) have been reported individually and collectively.



   Cardiovascular System  - Hypotension, Myocardial infarction;  Endocrine System  - Diabetes;  Gastrointestinal System  - Hepatic dysfunction;  Hemic and Lymphatic System  - Decreased WBC;  Integumentary System  - Hair growth;  Central/Peripheral Nervous System  - Convulsion, Spinal fracture/paralysis, Hearing disorder;  Miscellaneous  - Hard nodule in throat, Weight gain, Increased uric acid;  Musculoskeletal System  - Tenosynovitis-like symptoms;  Respiratory System  - Respiratory disorders.



   Changes in Bone Density:  Decreased bone density has been reported in the medical literature in men who have had orchiectomy or who have been treated with an LH-RH agonist analog. In a clinical trial, 25 men with prostate cancer, 12 of whom had been treated previously with leuprolide acetate for at least six months, underwent bone density studies as a result of pain. The leuprolide-treated group had lower bone density scores than the nontreated control group. It can be anticipated that long periods of medical castration in men will have effects on bone density.



   Pituitary apoplexy:  During post-marketing surveillance, rare cases of pituitary apoplexy (a clinical syndrome secondary to infarction of the pituitary gland) have been reported after the administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists. In a majority of these cases, a pituitary adenoma was diagnosed, with a majority of pituitary apoplexy cases occurring within 2 weeks of the first dose, and some within the first hour. In these cases, pituitary apoplexy has presented as sudden headache, vomiting, visual changes, ophthalmoplegia, altered mental status, and sometimes cardiovascular collapse. Immediate medical attention has been required.

</Section>
    <Section id="S2" name="precautions">    PRECAUTIONS



  Patients with metastatic vertebral lesions and/or with urinary tract obstruction should be closely observed during the first few weeks of therapy (see   WARNINGS    and   ADVERSE REACTIONS    sections).



 Patients with known allergies to benzyl alcohol, an ingredient of the drug's vehicle, may present symptoms of hypersensitivity, usually local, in the form of erythema and induration at the injection site.



 Hyperglycemia and an increased risk of developing diabetes have been reported in men receiving GnRH agonists. Hyperglycemia may represent development of diabetes mellitus or worsening of glycemic control in patients with diabetes. Monitor blood glucose and/or glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) periodically in patients receiving a GnRH agonist and manage with current practice for treatment of hyperglycemia or diabetes.



 Increased risk of developing myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death and stroke has been reported in association with use of GnRH agonists in men. The risk appears low based on the reported odds ratios, and should be evaluated carefully along with cardiovascular risk factors when determining a treatment for patients with prostate cancer. Patients receiving a GnRH agonist should be monitored for symptoms and signs suggestive of development of cardiovascular disease and be managed according to current clinical practice.



    Effect on QT/QTc Interval



  Androgen deprivation therapy may prolong the QT/QTc interval. Providers should consider whether the benefits of androgen deprivation therapy outweigh the potential risks in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, frequent electrolyte abnormalities, and in patients taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval. Electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected. Consider periodic monitoring of electrocardiograms and electrolytes.



    Information for Patients



  See   INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS    which appears after the REFERENCE  section.



    Laboratory Tests



  Response to leuprolide acetate should be monitored by measuring serum levels of testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). In the majority of patients, testosterone levels increased above baseline during the first week, declining thereafter to baseline levels or below by the end of the second week of treatment. Castrate levels were reached within two to four weeks and once attained were maintained for as long as drug administration continued.



    Drug Interactions



  See   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics    section.



    Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions



  Administration of leuprolide acetate in therapeutic doses results in suppression of the pituitary-gonadal system. Normal function is usually restored within 4 to 12 weeks after treatment is discontinued.



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility



  Two-year carcinogenicity studies were conducted in rats and mice. In rats, a dose-related increase of benign pituitary hyperplasia and benign pituitary adenomas was noted at 24 months when the drug was administered subcutaneously at high daily doses (0.6 to 4 mg/kg). There was a significant but not dose-related increase of pancreatic islet-cell adenomas in females and of testicular interstitial cell adenomas in males (highest incidence in the low dose group). In mice no pituitary abnormalities were observed at a dose as high as 60 mg/kg for two years. Patients have been treated with leuprolide acetate for up to three years with doses as high as 10 mg/day and for two years with doses as high as 20 mg/day without demonstrable pituitary abnormalities.



 Mutagenicity studies have been performed with leuprolide acetate using bacterial and mammalian systems. These studies provided no evidence of a mutagenic potential.



 Clinical and pharmacologic studies in adults (&gt;= 18 years) with leuprolide acetate and similar analogs have shown full reversibility of fertility suppression when the drug is discontinued after continuous administration for periods of up to 24 weeks. However, no clinical studies have been conducted with leuprolide acetate to assess the reversibility of fertility suppression.



    Pregnancy



  Teratogenic Effects



  Pregnancy Category X  



 (see   CONTRAINDICATIONS    and   WARNINGS    sections)



 When administered on day 6 of pregnancy at test dosages of 0.00024, 0.0024, and 0.024 mg/kg (1/600 to 1/6 the human dose) to rabbits, LUPRON produced a dose-related increase in major fetal abnormalities. Similar studies in rats failed to demonstrate an increase in major fetal malformations throughout gestation. There was increased fetal mortality and decreased fetal weights with the two higher doses of LUPRON in rabbits and with the highest dose in rats. The effects on fetal mortality are expected consequences of the alterations in hormonal levels brought about by this drug.



    Nursing Mothers



  It is not known whether leuprolide acetate is excreted in human milk. LUPRON should not be used by nursing mothers.



    Pediatric Use



  See labeling for   LUPRON INJECTION for Pediatric Use    for the safety and effectiveness in children with central precocious puberty.



    Geriatric Use



  In the clinical trials for LUPRON INJECTION, the majority (69%) of subjects studied were at least 65 years of age. Therefore, the labeling reflects the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of LUPRON in this population.



       PRECAUTIONS



  Patients with known allergies to benzyl alcohol, an ingredient of the vehicle of LUPRON INJECTION, may present symptoms of hypersensitivity, usually local, in the form of erythema and induration at the injection site.



    Information for Caregivers



  Prior to starting therapy with LUPRON INJECTION, the parent or guardian must be aware of the importance of continuous therapy. Adherence to daily drug administration schedules must be accepted if therapy is to be successful. Irregular dosing could restart the maturation process.



 *  During the first 2 months of therapy, a female may experience menses or spotting. If bleeding continues beyond the second month, notify the physician. 
 *  Any irritation at the injection site should be reported to the physician immediately. If the child has experienced an allergic reaction to other drugs like LUPRON, this drug should not be used. 
 *  Report any unusual signs or symptoms to the physician, like continued pubertal changes, substantial mood swings or behavioral changes. 
 *  Inform caregivers that symptoms of emotional lability, such as crying, irritability, impatience, anger and aggression, have been observed in patients receiving GnRH agonists, including leuprolide acetate. Alert caregivers to the possibility of development or worsening of psychiatric symptoms, including depression, during treatment with LUPRON (see   WARNINGS   and   ADVERSE REACTIONS   ). 
 *  Inform caregivers that reports of convulsions have been observed in patients receiving GnRH agonists, including leuprolide acetate. Patients with a history of seizures, epilepsy, cerebrovascular disorders, central nervous system anomalies or tumors, and patients on concomitant medications that have been associated with convulsions may be at increased risk (see   WARNINGS   ). 
       Laboratory Tests
 

  Response to leuprolide acetate should be monitored 1-2 months after the start of therapy with a GnRH stimulation test and sex steroid levels. Measurement of bone age for advancement should be done every 6-12 months.



 Sex steroids may increase or rise above prepubertal levels if the dose is inadequate (see   WARNINGS    section). Once a therapeutic dose has been established, gonadotropin and sex steroid levels will decline to prepubertal levels.



    Drug Interactions



  See   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics    section.



    Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions



  Administration of leuprolide acetate in therapeutic doses results in suppression of the pituitary-gonadal system. Normal function is usually restored within 4 to 12 weeks after treatment is discontinued.



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility



  A two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in rats and mice. In rats, a dose-related increase of benign pituitary hyperplasia and benign pituitary adenomas was noted at 24 months when the drug was administered subcutaneously at high daily doses of 0.6 to 4 mg/kg (&gt;100 times the clinical doses of 7.5 to 15 mg/month based on body surface area). There was a significant but not dose-related increase of pancreatic islet-cell adenomas in females and of testes interstitial cell adenomas in males (highest incidence in the low dose group). In mice, no leuprolide acetate-induced tumors or pituitary abnormalities were observed at daily dose as high as 60 mg/kg (&gt;5000 times the clinical doses based on body surface area). Adult patients have been treated with leuprolide acetate for up to three years with doses as high as 10 mg/day and for two years with doses as high as 20 mg/day without demonstrable pituitary abnormalities.



 Although no clinical studies have been completed in children to assess the full reversibility of fertility suppression, animal studies (prepubertal and adult rats and monkeys) with leuprolide acetate and other GnRH analogs have shown functional recovery. However, following a study with leuprolide acetate, immature male rats demonstrated tubular degeneration in the testes even after a recovery period. In spite of the failure to recover histologically, the treated males proved to be as fertile as the controls. Also, no histologic changes were observed in the female rats following the same protocol. In both sexes, the offspring of the treated animals appeared normal. The effect of the treatment of the parents on the reproductive performance of the F1 generation was not tested. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.



    Pregnancy



   Teratogenic Effects



   Pregnancy Category X



  (see   CONTRAINDICATIONS    section)



 When administered on day 6 of pregnancy at test dosages of 0.00024, 0.0024, and 0.024 mg/kg (1/1200 to 1/12 the human pediatric dose) to rabbits, LUPRON produced a dose-related increase in major fetal abnormalities. Similar studies in rats failed to demonstrate an increase in fetal malformations. There was increased fetal mortality and decreased fetal weights with the two higher doses of LUPRON in rabbits and with the highest dose in rats.



    Nursing Mothers



  It is not known whether leuprolide acetate is excreted in human milk. LUPRON should not be used by nursing mothers.



    Geriatric Use



  See labeling for LUPRON INJECTION for the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of LUPRON in this population.

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings">    WARNINGS



  Initially, LUPRON, like other LH-RH agonists, causes increases in serum levels of testosterone. Transient worsening of symptoms, or the occurrence of additional signs and symptoms of prostate cancer, may occasionally develop during the first few weeks of LUPRON treatment. A small number of patients may experience a temporary increase in bone pain, which can be managed symptomatically. As with other LH-RH agonists, isolated cases of ureteral obstruction and spinal cord compression have been observed, which may contribute to paralysis with or without fatal complications.



 Safe use of leuprolide acetate in pregnancy has not been established clinically. Before starting treatment with LUPRON, pregnancy must be excluded (see   CONTRAINDICATIONS    section).



 Periodic monitoring of serum testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels is recommended, especially if the anticipated clinical or biochemical response to treatment has not been achieved. It should be noted that results of testosterone determinations are dependent on assay methodology. It is advisable to be aware of the type and precision of the assay methodology to make appropriate clinical and therapeutic decisions.



       WARNINGS



  During the early phase of therapy, gonadotropins and sex steroids rise above baseline because of the natural stimulatory effect of the drug. Therefore, an increase in clinical signs and symptoms may be observed (see   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY    section).



 Psychiatric events have been reported in patients taking GnRH agonists, including leuprolide acetate. Postmarketing reports with this class of drugs include symptoms of emotional lability, such as crying, irritability, impatience, anger, and aggression. Monitor for development or worsening of psychiatric symptoms during treatment with LUPRON (see   ADVERSE REACTIONS    ).



 Postmarketing reports of convulsions have been observed in patients receiving GnRH agonists, including leuprolide acetate. These have included patients with a history of seizures, epilepsy, cerebrovascular disorders, central nervous system anomalies or tumors, and patients on concomitant medications that have been associated with convulsions such as bupropion and SSRIs. Convulsions have also been reported in patients in the absence of any of the conditions mentioned above.



 Noncompliance with drug regimen or inadequate dosing may result in inadequate control of the pubertal process. The consequences of poor control include the return of pubertal signs such as menses, breast development, and testicular growth. The long-term consequences of inadequate control of gonadal steroid secretion are unknown, but may include a further compromise of adult stature.
