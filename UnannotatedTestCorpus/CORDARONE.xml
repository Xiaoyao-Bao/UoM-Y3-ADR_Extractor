  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 At the usual maintenance dose (400 mg/day) and above, CORDARONE causes adverse reactions in about three-fourths of all patients, resulting in discontinuation in 7 to 18%.



 In surveys of almost 5,000 patients treated in open U.S. studies and in published reports of treatment with CORDARONE, the adverse reactions most frequently requiring discontinuation of CORDARONE included pulmonary infiltrates or fibrosis, paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia, congestive heart failure, and elevation of liver enzymes. Other symptoms causing discontinuations less often included visual disturbances, photosensitivity, blue skin discoloration, hyperthyroidism, and hypothyroidism.



 The following side-effect rates are based on a retrospective study of 241 patients treated for 2 to 1,515 days (mean 441.3 days):



   Thyroid  



 Common: Hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism.



   Cardiovascular  



 Common: Congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, SA node dysfunction.



   Gastrointestinal  



 Very common: Nausea, vomiting.



 Common: Constipation, anorexia, abdominal pain.



   Dermatologic

   Neurologic  



 Common: Malaise and fatigue, tremor/abnormal involuntary movements, lack of coordination, abnormal gait/ataxia, dizziness, paresthesias, decreased libido, insomnia, headache, sleep disturbances.



   Ophthalmic  



 Common: Visual disturbances.



   Hepatic  



 Common: Abnormal liver-function tests, nonspecific hepatic disorders.



   Respiratory  



 Common: Pulmonary inflammation or fibrosis.



   Other  



 Common: Flushing, abnormal taste and smell, edema, abnormal salivation, coagulation abnormalities.



 Uncommon: Blue skin discoloration, rash, spontaneous ecchymosis, alopecia, hypotension, and cardiac conduction abnormalities.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of CORDARONE. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Hematologic  : hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, granuloma.



   Immune:  anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction (including shock), angioedema.



   Neurologic  : pseudotumor cerebri, parkinsonian symptoms such as akinesia and bradykinesia (sometimes reversible with discontinuation of therapy), demyelinating polyneuropathy.



   Psychiatric  : hallucination, confusional state, disorientation, delirium.



   Cardiac  : hypotension (sometimes fatal), sinus arrest.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: PULMONARY, HEPATIC and CARDIAC TOXICITY

  WARNING: PULMONARY, HEPATIC and CARDIAC TOXICITY

    CORDARONE is intended for use only in patients with the indicated life-threatening arrhythmias because its use is accompanied by substantial toxicity   [see   Indications and Usage (1)  ].    



   CORDARONE can cause pulmonary toxicity (hypersensitivity pneumonitis or interstitial/alveolar pneumonitis) that has resulted in clinically manifest disease at rates as high as 17% in some series of patients. Pulmonary toxicity has been fatal about 10% of the time  .   Obtain a baseline chest X-ray and pulmonary-function tests, including diffusion capacity, when CORDARONE therapy is initiated. Repeat history, physical exam, and chest X-ray every 3 to 6 months   [see   Warnings and Precautions 5.2)  ].    



   CORDARONE can cause hepatoxicity, which can be fatal. Obtain baseline and periodic liver transaminases and discontinue or reduce dose if the increase exceeds three times normal, or doubles in a patient with an elevated baseline. Discontinue CORDARONE if the patient experiences signs or symptoms of clinical liver injury   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ].    



   CORDARONE can exacerbate arrhythmias. Initiate CORDARONE in a clinical setting where continuous electrocardiograms and cardiac resuscitation are available   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.4)  ].    



   EXCERPT:   WARNING: PULMONARY, HEPATIC, and CARDIAC TOXICITY



   See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning  .



 *  Reserve CORDARONE for patients with the indicated life-threatening arrhythmias because its use is accompanied by substantial toxicity, some also life-threatening. Utilize alternative agents first. (1) 
 *  CORDARONE's life-threatening toxicities include pulmonary (5.2), hepatic (5.3), and proarrhythmic (5.4). 
 *  Initiate under hospital or specialist supervision. (5)

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Persistence of Adverse Effects: Adverse reactions and drug interaction can persist for several weeks following discontinuation. (  5.1  ) 
 *  Impaired Vision: Corneal microdeposits (common; reversible), optic neuropathy/neuritis (rare; may lead to blindness). (  5.5  ) 
 *  Thyroid Abnormalities: Hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. (  5.6  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Persistence of Adverse Effects



  Because of the long half-life of amiodarone (15 to 142 days) and its active metabolite desethylamiodarone (14 to 75 days), adverse reactions and drug interactions can persist for several weeks following amiodarone discontinuation [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  .



    5.2 Pulmonary Toxicity



  CORDARONE may cause a clinical syndrome of cough and progressive dyspnea accompanied by functional, radiographic, gallium-scan, and pathological data consistent with pulmonary toxicity. Pulmonary toxicity secondary to CORDARONE may result from either indirect or direct toxicity as represented by hypersensitivity pneumonitis (including eosinophilic pneumonia) or interstitial/alveolar pneumonitis, respectively. Rates of pulmonary toxicity have been reported to be as high as 17% and is fatal in about 10% of cases. Obtain a baseline chest X-ray and pulmonary-function tests, including diffusion capacity, when CORDARONE therapy is initiated. Repeat history, physical exam, and chest X-ray every 3 to 6 months or if symptoms occur. Consider alternative antiarrhythmic therapy if the patient experiences signs or symptoms of pulmonary toxicity. Prednisone 40 to 60 mg/day tapered over several weeks may be helpful in treating pulmonary toxicity.



    Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)  



  Postoperatively, occurrences of ARDS have been reported in patients receiving CORDARONE therapy who have undergone either cardiac or noncardiac surgery. Although patients usually respond well to vigorous respiratory therapy, in rare instances the outcome has been fatal.  



    5.3 Hepatic Injury



  Asymptomatic elevations of hepatic enzyme levels are seen frequently, but CORDARONE can cause life-threatening hepatic injury. Histology has resembled that of alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis. Obtain baseline and periodic liver transaminases. If transaminases exceed three times normal, or doubles in a patient with an elevated baseline, discontinue or reduce dose of CORDARONE, obtain follow-up tests and treat appropriately.



    5.4 Worsened Arrhythmia



  CORDARONE can exacerbate the presenting arrhythmia in about 2 to 5% of patients or cause new ventricular fibrillation, incessant ventricular tachycardia, increased resistance to cardioversion, and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia associated with QTc prolongation (Torsade de Pointes [TdP]).



 Correct hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia before initiating treatment with CORDARONE, as these disorders can exaggerate the degree of QTc prolongation and increase the potential for TdP. Give special attention to electrolyte and acid-base balance in patients experiencing severe or prolonged diarrhea or receiving drugs affecting electrolyte levels, such as diuretics, laxatives, systemic corticosteroids, or amphotericin B.



    5.5 Visual Impairment and Loss of Vision



   Optic Neuropathy and Optic Neuritis  



 Cases of optic neuropathy and optic neuritis, usually resulting in visual impairment and sometimes permanent blindness, have been reported in patients treated with amiodarone and may occur at any time during therapy. If symptoms of visual impairment appear, such as changes in visual acuity and decreases in peripheral vision, consider discontinuing CORDARONE and promptly refer for ophthalmic examination. Regular ophthalmic examination, including funduscopy and slit-lamp examination, is recommended during administration of CORDARONE [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



    Corneal Microdeposits  



 Corneal microdeposits appear in the majority of adults treated with CORDARONE. They are usually discernible only by slit-lamp examination, but give rise to symptoms such as visual halos or blurred vision in as many as 10% of patients. Corneal microdeposits are reversible upon reduction of dose or termination of treatment. Asymptomatic microdeposits alone are not a reason to reduce dose or discontinue treatment [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



    5.6 Thyroid Abnormalities



  CORDARONE inhibits peripheral conversion of thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) and may cause increased thyroxine levels, decreased T3levels, and increased levels of inactive reverse T3(rT3) in clinically euthyroid patients. CORDARONE can cause either hypothyroidism (reported in up to 10% of patients) or hyperthyroidism (occurring in about 2% of patients). Monitor thyroid function prior to treatment and periodically thereafter, particularly in elderly patients, and in any patient with a history of thyroid nodules, goiter, or other thyroid dysfunction.



  Hyperthyroidism may  induce arrhythmia breakthrough. If any new signs of arrhythmia appear, the possibility of hyperthyroidism should be considered. Antithyroid drugs, beta-adrenergic blockers, temporary corticosteroid therapy may be necessary to treat the symptoms of hyperthyroidism. The action of antithyroid drugs may be delayed in amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis because of substantial quantities of preformed thyroid hormones stored in the gland. Radioactive iodine therapy is contraindicated because of the low radioiodine uptake associated with amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism. CORDARONE-induced hyperthyroidism may be followed by a transient period of hypothyroidism.



 Hypothyrodism may be primary or subsequent to resolution of preceding amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism. Severe hypothyroidism and myxedema coma, sometimes fatal, have been reported in association with amiodarone therapy. In some clinically hypothyroid amiodarone-treated patients, free thyroxine index values may be normal. Manage hypothyroidism by reducing the dose of or discontinuing CORDARONE and thyroid hormone supplementation.



    5.7 Bradycardia



  CORDARONE causes symptomatic bradycardia or sinus arrest with suppression of escape foci in 2 to 4% of patients. The risk is increased by electrolytic disorders or use of concomitant antiarrhythmics or negative chronotropes [see  Drug Interactions (7)  ].  Bradycardia may require a pacemaker for rate control.



 Postmarketing cases of symptomatic bradycardia, some requiring pacemaker insertion and at least one fatal, have been reported when ledipasvir/sofosbuvir or sofosbuvir with simeprevir were initiated in patients on amiodarone. Bradycardia generally occurred within hours to days, but in some cases presented up to 2 weeks after initiating antiviral treatment. Bradycardia generally resolved after discontinuation of antiviral treatment. The mechanism for this effect is unknown. Monitor heart rate in patients taking or recently discontinuing amiodarone when starting antiviral treatment [see  Drug Interactions (7)  ]  .



    5.8 Implantable Cardiac Devices



  In patients with implanted defibrillators or pacemakers, chronic administration of antiarrhythmic drugs may affect pacing or defibrillation thresholds. Therefore, at the inception of and during amiodarone treatment, pacing and defibrillation thresholds should be assessed.



    5.9 Fetal Toxicity



  CORDARONE may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Fetal exposure may increase the potential for cardiac, thyroid, neurodevelopmental, neurological, and growth effects in neonate [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ]  .



    5.10 Peripheral Neuropathy



  Chronic administration of CORDARONE may lead to peripheral neuropathy, which may not resolve when CORDARONE is discontinued.



    5.11 Photosensitivity and Skin Discoloration



  CORDARONE induces photosensitization in about 10% of patients; some protection may be afforded sun-barrier creams or protective clothing. During long-term treatment, a blue-gray discoloration of the exposed skin may occur. The risk may be increased in patients of fair complexion or those with excessive sun exposure. Some reversal of discoloration may occur upon drug discontinuation.



    5.12 Surgery



   Volatile Anesthetic Agents  



 Patients on CORDARONE therapy may be more sensitive to the myocardial depressant and conduction effects of halogenated inhalational anesthetics.
