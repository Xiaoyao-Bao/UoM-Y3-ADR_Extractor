    6.1          Clinical Trials Experience  

  Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



   Olmesartan medoxomil    and         hydrochlorothiazide  



 The concomitant use of olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide was evaluated for safety in 1243 hypertensive patients. Treatment with olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide was well tolerated, with an incidence of adverse events similar to that of placebo. Adverse reactions were generally mild, transient and not dependent on the dose of olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide. 



 The rate of withdrawals for adverse events in all trials of hypertensive patients was 2.0% (25/1243) on olmesartan medoxomil plus hydrochlorothiazide and 2.0% (7/342) on placebo.



 In a placebo-controlled, factorial clinical trial of olmesartan medoxomil (2.5 mg to 40 mg) and hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg to 25 mg), the following adverse reactions reported in Table 1 occurred in &gt;2% of patients, and more often on the olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide combination than on placebo.

 Upper Respiratory Infection  7                6                7                0                 
           Other adverse reactions that have been reported with an incidence of greater than 1.0%, whether or not attributed to treatment, in the more than 1200 hypertensive patients treated with olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide in controlled or open-label trials are listed below.
 

   Body as a Whole:  chest pain, back pain, peripheral edema  Central and Peripheral Nervous System:  vertigo       Gastrointestinal:  abdominal pain, dyspepsia, gastroenteritis, diarrhea  Liver and Biliary System:  SGOT increased, GGT increased, ALT increased  Metabolic and Nutritional:       creatine phosphokinase increased  Musculoskeletal:  arthritis, arthralgia, myalgia  Respiratory System:  coughing  Skin and Appendages Disorders:  rash  Urinary System:  hematuria



 Facial edema was reported in 2/1243 patients receiving olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide. Angioedema has been reported with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including BENICAR HCT.



   Hydrochlorothiazide  



 Other adverse reactions that have been reported with hydrochlorothiazide are listed below:



   Body as a Whole:  weakness  Digestive:  pancreatitis, jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice), sialadenitis, cramping, gastric irritation  Hematologic:  aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia  Hypersensitivity:  purpura, photosensitivity, urticaria, necrotizing angiitis (vasculitis and cutaneous vasculitis), fever, respiratory distress including pneumonitis and pulmonary edema, anaphylactic reactions  Metabolic:  glycosuria, hyperuricemia  Musculoskeletal:  muscle spasm  Nervous System/Psychiatric:  restlessness  Renal:  renal dysfunction, interstitial nephritis  Skin:  erythema multiforme including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis including toxic epidermal necrolysis  Special Senses:  transient blurred vision, xanthopsia



   Clinical Laboratory Test Findings  



   Creatinine/    b    lood    u    rea    n    itrogen (BUN):  Minor elevations in creatinine and BUN occurred in 1.7% and 2.5% respectively, of patients taking BENICAR HCT and 0% and 0% respectively, given placebo in controlled clinical trials.



     6.2    Post    m    arketing Experience  

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of BENICAR HCT. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: 



   Body as a Whole:  Asthenia  Gastrointestinal:  Vomiting  Metabolic:  Hyperkalemia  Musculoskeletal:  Rhabdomyolysis   Skin and Appendages:  Alopecia, pruritus



 Data from one controlled trial and an epidemiologic study have suggested that high-dose olmesartan may increase cardiovascular (CV) risk in diabetic patients, but the overall data are not conclusive. The randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind ROADMAP trial (Randomized Olmesartan And Diabetes MicroAlbuminuria Prevention trial, n=4447) examined the use of olmesartan, 40 mg daily, vs. placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, normoalbuminuria, and at least one additional risk factor for CV disease. The trial met its primary endpoint, delayed onset of microalbuminuria, but olmesartan had no beneficial effect on decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). There was a finding of increased CV mortality (adjudicated sudden cardiac death, fatal myocardial infarction, fatal stroke, revascularization death) in the olmesartan group compared to the placebo group (15 olmesartan vs. 3 placebo, HR 4.9, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4, 17), but the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction was lower with olmesartan (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.35, 1.18).



 The epidemiologic study included patients 65 years and older with overall exposure of &gt; 300,000 patient-years. In the sub-group of diabetic patients receiving high-dose olmesartan (40 mg/d) for &gt; 6 months, there appeared to be an increased risk of death (HR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1, 3.8) compared to similar patients taking other angiotensin receptor blockers. In contrast, high-dose olmesartan use in non-diabetic patients appeared to be associated with a decreased risk of death (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.24, 0.86) compared to similar patients taking other angiotensin receptor blockers. No differences were observed between the groups receiving lower doses of olmesartan compared to other angiotensin blockers or those receiving therapy for &lt; 6 months.



 Overall, these data raise a concern of a possible increased CV risk associated with the use of high-dose olmesartan in diabetic patients. There are, however, concerns with the credibility of the finding of increased CV risk, notably the observation in the large epidemiologic study for a survival benefit in non-diabetics of a magnitude similar to the adverse finding in diabetics.

    5.1         Fetal   Toxicity      



  Pregnancy Category D



 Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue BENICAR HCT as soon as possible [   see     Use in Specific Populations (8.1)     ].   



 Thiazides cross the placental barrier and appear in cord blood. Adverse reactions include fetal or neonatal jaundice and thrombocytopenia  [   s   ee     Use in Specific Populations (8.1)     ]   .  



     5.2         Hypotension in Volume or Salt-Depleted Patients  



  In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system, such as volume- or salt-depleted patients ( e.g.,  those being treated with high doses of diuretics), symptomatic hypotension may occur after initiation of treatment with BENICAR HCT. If hypotension does occur, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. When electrolyte and fluid imbalances have been corrected, BENICAR HCT usually can be continued without difficulty. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment.



     5.3        Impaired       Renal Function  



  Changes in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and by diuretics. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system ( e.g.  , patients with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe congestive heart failure, or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing acute renal failure on BENICAR HCT. Monitor renal function periodically in these patients. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on BENICAR HCT  [   s   ee     Drug Interactions (7)     ]   .  



     5.4         Hypersensitivity Reactions  



  Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history.



     5.   5         Electrolyte and Metabolic   Imbalances  



  BENICAR HCT contains hydrochlorothiazide which can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which may be difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. BENICAR HCT also contains olmesartan, a drug that inhibits the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Drugs that inhibit the RAS can cause hyperkalemia. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically.



 Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.



 Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in patients receiving thiazide therapy. 



 Hydrochlorothiazide decreases urinary calcium excretion and may cause elevations of serum calcium. Monitor calcium levels.



     5.6         Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle-Closure Glaucoma  



  Hydrochlorothiazide, a sulfonamide, can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in acute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue hydrochlorothiazide as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy.



     5.   7         Systemic Lupus Erythematosus  



  Thiazide diuretics have been reported to cause exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus.



     5   .   8             Sprue-L   ike Enteropathy  



  Severe, chronic diarrhea with substantial weight loss has been reported in patients taking olmesartan months to years after drug initiation. Intestinal biopsies of patients often demonstrated villous atrophy. If a patient develops these symptoms during treatment with olmesartan, exclude other etiologies. Consider discontinuation of BENICAR HCT in cases where no other etiology is identified.
