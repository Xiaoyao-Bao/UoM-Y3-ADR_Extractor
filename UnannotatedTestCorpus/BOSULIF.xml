  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 Serious adverse reactions reported include anaphylactic shock  [see  Contraindications (4)  ]  , myelosuppression, gastrointestinal toxicity (diarrhea), fluid retention, hepatotoxicity and rash.



     Adverse Reactions in Patients With Newly-Diagnosed CP CML  



 The clinical trial randomized and treated 533 patients with newly-diagnosed CP CML to receive BOSULIF 400 mg daily or imatinib 400 mg daily as single agents (Newly-Diagnosed CP CML Study)  [see  Clinical Studies (14.1)  ]  . The safety population (received at least 1 dose of BOSULIF) included:



 *  two hundred sixty-eight (268) patients with newly-diagnosed CP CML had a median duration of BOSULIF treatment of 14.1 months (range: 0.3 to 24.7 months) and a median dose intensity of 391.8 mg/day. 
    Adverse reactions reported for greater than or equal to 20% of bosutinib patients with newly-diagnosed CML (N=268) were diarrhea (70%), nausea (35%), thrombocytopenia (35%), rash (34%), increased ALT (31%), abdominal pain (25%), and increased AST (23%)  [see  Clinical Studies (14.1)  ]  .
 

 Table 4 identifies adverse reactions greater than or equal to 10% for All Grades and Grades 3 or 4 (3/4) for the Phase 3 CP CML safety population.

             Adverse Reactions in Patients With Imatinib-Resistant or -Intolerant Ph+ CP, AP, and BP CML  
 

 The single-arm clinical trial enrolled patients with Ph+ CP, AP, or BP CML and with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy  [see  Clinical Studies (14)  ]  . The safety population (received at least 1 dose of BOSULIF) included 546 CML patients:



 *  two hundred eighty-four (284) patients with CP CML previously treated with imatinib only who had a median duration of BOSULIF treatment of 26 months, and a median dose intensity of 442 mg/day. 
 *  one hundred nineteen (119) patients with CP CML previously treated with both imatinib and at least 1 additional tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) who had a median duration of BOSULIF treatment of 9 months and a median dose intensity of 442 mg/day. 
 *  one hundred forty-three (143) patients with advanced phase CML including 79 patients with AP CML and 64 patients with BP CML. In the patients with AP CML and BP CML, the median duration of BOSULIF treatment was 10 months and 3 months, respectively. The median dose intensity was 425 mg/day, and 456 mg/day, in the AP CML and BP CML cohorts, respectively. 
    Adverse reactions of any toxicity grade reported for greater than or equal to 20% of patients in the safety population of the single-arm trial in patients with CP CML (N=546) who were resistant or intolerant to prior therapy were diarrhea (85%), nausea (47%), abdominal pain (42%), rash (42%), thrombocytopenia (40%), vomiting (37%), anemia (27%), fatigue (26%), pyrexia (23%), cough (22%), headache (21%), ALT (20%), and edema (20%)  [see  Clinical Studies (14.2)  ].

 *  Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: BOSULIF can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. (  5.6  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Gastrointestinal Toxicity



  Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain occur with BOSULIF treatment. Monitor and manage patients using standards of care, including antidiarrheals, antiemetics, and fluid replacement.



  In the randomized clinical trial in patients with newly-diagnosed Ph+ CML, the median time to onset for diarrhea (all grades) was 3 days and the median duration per event was 3 days.  



  Among 546 patients in a single-arm study in patients with CML who were resistant or intolerant to prior therapy, the median time to onset for diarrhea (all grades) was 2 days and the median duration per event was 2 days. Among the patients who experienced diarrhea, the median number of episodes of diarrhea per patient during treatment with BOSULIF was 3 (range 1-268).  



 To manage gastrointestinal toxicity, withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  and  Adverse Reactions (6)  ]  .



    5.2 Myelosuppression



  Thrombocytopenia, anemia and neutropenia occur with BOSULIF treatment. Perform complete blood counts weekly for the first month of therapy and then monthly thereafter, or as clinically indicated. To manage myelosuppression, withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary [see  Dosage and Administration (2.4)  and  Adverse Reactions (6)  ]  .



    5.3 Hepatic Toxicity



   Bosutinib may cause elevations in serum transaminases (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST]).  



  One case consistent with drug induced liver injury (defined as concurrent elevations in ALT or AST greater than or equal to 3*ULN with total bilirubin greater than 2*ULN and alkaline phosphatase less than 2*ULN) occurred without alternative causes in a breast cancer (a disease for which BOSULIF is not indicated) trial of BOSULIF in combination with letrozole. The patient recovered fully following discontinuation of BOSULIF. This case represented 1 out of 1611 patients in BOSULIF clinical trials.  



  In the 268 patients from the safety population in the randomized clinical trial in patients with newly-diagnosed CML in the BOSULIF treatment group, the incidence of ALT elevation was 31% and AST elevation was 23%. Of patients who experienced transaminase elevations of any grade, 79% experienced their first event within the first 3 months. The median time to onset of increased ALT and AST was 32 and 43 days, respectively, and the median duration was 20 and 15 days, respectively.  



  Among the 546 patients in a single-arm study in patients with CML who were resistant or intolerant to prior therapy, the incidence of ALT elevation was 18% and AST elevation was 15%. Twenty percent of the patients experienced an increase in either ALT or AST. Most cases of transaminase elevations in this study occurred early in treatment; of patients who experienced transaminase elevations of any grade, more than 80% experienced their first event within the first 3 months. The median time to onset of increased ALT and AST was 35 and 33 days, respectively, and the median duration for each was 21 days.  



 Perform hepatic enzyme tests monthly for the first 3 months of BOSULIF treatment and as clinically indicated. In patients with transaminase elevations, monitor liver enzymes more frequently. Withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  and  Adverse Reactions (6)  ]  .



    5.4 Fluid Retention



  Fluid retention occurs with BOSULIF and may manifest as pericardial effusion, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, and/or peripheral edema.



  In the randomized clinical trial of 268 patients with newly-diagnosed CML in the bosutinib treatment group, 1 patient (0.4%) experienced severe fluid retention of Grade 3 pericardial effusion. Among 546 patients in a single-arm study in patients with Ph+ CML who were resistant or intolerant to prior therapy, Grade 3 or 4 fluid retention was reported in 26 patients (5%). Some patients experienced more than one fluid retention event. Specifically, 21 patients experienced Grade 3 or 4 pleural effusions, 7 patients experienced Grade 3 or Grade 4 pericardial effusions, and 6 patients experienced Grade 3 edema.  



 Monitor and manage patients using standards of care. Interrupt, dose reduce or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  and  Adverse Reactions (6)  ]  .



    5.5 Renal Toxicity



   An on-treatment decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) has occurred in patients treated with BOSULIF. Table 3 identifies the shift from baseline to lowest observed eGFR during BOSULIF therapy for patients in the pooled leukemia studies regardless of line of therapy. The median duration of therapy with BOSULIF was approximately 14 months (range, 0.03 to 123) for patients in these studies.  



 Table 3: Shift From Baseline to Lowest Observed eGFR Group During Treatment Safety Population in Clinical Studies (N=1272)Among the 1272 patients, eGFR was missing in 9 patients at baseline or on-therapy. There were no patients with kidney failure at baseline.

              Monitor renal function at baseline and during therapy with BOSULIF, with particular attention to those patients who have preexisting renal impairment or risk factors for renal dysfunction. Consider dose adjustment in patients with baseline and treatment emergent renal impairment [see  Dosage and Administration (2.5)  ].  
 

    5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



   Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, BOSULIF can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies conducted in rats and rabbits, oral administration of bosutinib caused adverse developmental outcomes. Administration of bosutinib to rats prior to fertilization until gestation day (GD) 7 caused increased embryonic resorptions at maternal exposures (AUC) approximately 0.5 and 0.4 times the human exposure at the recommended doses of 400 and 500 mg/day, respectively, and decreased implantations and reduced number of viable embryos at maternal exposures approximately 1.8 and 1.3 times the human exposure at the recommended doses of 400 or 500 mg/day, respectively. Administration of bosutinib to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis caused fetal anomalies (fused sternebrae, and 2 fetuses had various visceral observations), and an approximate 6% decrease in fetal body weight at maternal exposures (AUC) approximately 2.3 and 1.7 times the human exposure at the recommended doses of 400 and 500 mg/day dose, respectively. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 1 month after the last dose [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1  ,  8.3)  and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)  ]  .
