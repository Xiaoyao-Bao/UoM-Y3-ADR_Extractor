  In all clinical studies combined, a total of 308 patients were treated with Striant  (r)  for up to 12 months



   Twelve Week Trials

  In the pivotal, Phase 3, open-label controlled study (Study 1), 98 patients received Striant  (r)  for up to 12 weeks. Adverse events judged possibly, probably, or definitely related to the use of Striant  (r)  and reported by &gt;/= 1% of patients in Study 1 are listed in Table 2.

        Please see "  Gum-related adverse events and gum examinations  " subsection for further information. The majority of gum-related adverse events were transient. Gum irritation generally resolved in 1 to 8 days. Gum tenderness resolved in 1 to 14 days.
 

 The following adverse events judged possibly, probably or definitely related to the use of Striant  (r)  occurred in 1 patient each in Study 1: abdominal cramp, acne, anxiety, asthma (acute), breast enlargement, breast pain, buccal mucosal roughening, difficulty in micturition, fatigue, gingivitis, gum blister, gustatory sense diminished, hematocrit increased, lipids serum increased, liver function tests abnormal, nose edema, stinging of lips, and toothache.



 There was one additional 12-week study in 12 patients. In this study, additional adverse events judged at least possibly related to Striant  (r)  and reported by 1 patient each included emotional lability and hypertension.



   Long-Term Extension Trials

  In two long-term extension trials, a total of 117 and 51 patients received Striant  (r)  for at least 6 months and 1 year, respectively.



 Of 117 patients treated for at least 6 months, adverse events judged possibly, probably, or definitely related to treatment and reported by 1 patient each included: anxiety, buccal inflammation, depression, dry mouth, gastrointestinal disorder, gum redness, hypertension, infection, medication error, nausea, pruritis, renal function abnormal, stomatitis, taste bitter, taste perversion, and toothache. Polycythemia and increased serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) were reported in three and two patients, respectively.



 Adverse events reported in the 51 patients treated for at least one year were similar to those reported after 6 months of treatment and lower in incidence.



   Gum-related adverse events and gum examinations

  In the pivotal controlled study (Study 1), all reported gum-related adverse events were collected and gum examinations were conducted at Baseline and every month thereafter.



 In Study 1, a total of 16 patients reported 19 gum-related adverse events. Of these, ten patients (10.2%) reported 12 events of mild intensity, four patients (4.1%) reported 5 events of moderate intensity, and two patients (2.0%) reported 2 events of severe intensity. Most of these events were judged probably or definitely related to treatment with Striant  (r)  . Four patients (4.1%) discontinued treatment with Striant  (r)  due to gum or mouth-related adverse events including two with severe gum irritation, one with mouth irritation, and one with "bad taste in mouth". The majority of gum-related adverse events were transient. Gum irritation generally resolved in 1 to 8 days. Gum tenderness resolved in 1 to 14 days.



 In Study 1, monthly gum examinations were conducted to assess for gingivitis, gum edema, oral lesions, ulcerations or leukoplakia. No cases of ulceration or leukoplakia were observed. No new oral lesions were observed. Gingivitis was common at Baseline (32.6%), and was reduced at Week 4 (10.2%), Week 8 (10.2%) and Week 12 (11.2%). Similar findings were seen for gum edema.



 In the two long-term extension trials, gum examinations were conducted every 3 months while on treatment. In one of these trials, no patient had a gum abnormality, and in the other trial, moderate gingivitis and mild gum edema were reported by 1 patient each.

  Striant  (r)  is applied to the upper gum just above the incisor tooth on either side of the mouth. Long-term data on gum safety is available for 117 patients and 51 patients with at least 6 months and 1 year of exposure, respectively. While the available data supports the overall oral safety of Striant  (r)  , longer-term data is not currently available and studies continue. Until such longer-term data become available, it is recommended that patients regularly inspect their own gum region where Striant  (r)  is applied. Any abnormal finding should be brought promptly to the attention of the patient's physician. In such circumstances, dental consultation may be appropriate.



    General



  The physician should instruct patients to report any of the following:



 *  Too frequent or persistent erections of the penis. 
 *  Any nausea, vomiting, changes in skin color, or ankle swelling. 
 *  Breathing disturbances, including those associated with sleep. 
       Information for Patients
 

  Advise patients to carefully read the attached patient leaflet accompanying each carton of Striant  (r)  blister packaged tablets.



 Advise patients to regularly inspect the gum region where they apply Striant  (r)  and to report any abnormality to their health care professional.



    Laboratory Tests



    *  Hemoglobin and hematocrit levels should be checked periodically (to detect polycythemia) in patients on long-term androgen therapy. 
 *  Liver function, prostate specific antigen (PSA), cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein should be checked periodically. 
 *  Serum total testosterone concentrations may be checked four to twelve weeks after initiating treatment with Striant  (r)  . To capture the maximum serum concentration, an early morning sample (just prior to applying the A.M. dose) is recommended. In the infrequent circumstance where the total testosterone concentration in this sample is excessive, therapy with Striant  (r)  should be discontinued and an alternative treatment considered. 
       Drug interactions
 

   Oxyphenbutazone



  Concurrent administration of oxyphenbutazone and androgens may result in elevated serum levels of oxyphenbutazone.



    Insulin



  In diabetic patients, the metabolic effects of androgens may decrease blood glucose and therefore, insulin requirements.



    Corticosteroids



  Concurrent administration of testosterone with ACTH or corticosteroids may enhance edema formation and should be administered cautiously, particularly in patients with cardiac or hepatic disease.



    Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions



  Androgens may decrease levels of thyroxin-binding globulin, resulting in decreased total T4 serum levels and increased resin uptake of T3 and T4. Free thyroid hormone levels remain unchanged, however, and there is no clinical evidence of thyroid dysfunction.



    Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility



     Animal data



  Testosterone has been tested by subcutaneous injection and implantation in mice and rats. In mice, the implant induced cervical-uterine tumors, which metastasized in some cases. There is suggestive evidence that injection of testosterone into some strains of female mice increases their susceptibility to hepatoma. Testosterone is also known to increase the number of tumors and decrease the degree of differentiation of chemically induced carcinomas of the liver in rats.



    Human data



  There were rare reports of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients receiving long-term therapy with androgens in high doses. Withdrawal of the drugs did not lead to regression of the tumors in all cases.



 Striant  (r)  has been evaluated in patients for 1 year without reports of cancer related to the product. However, safety in patients beyond 1 year has not been established.



 Geriatric patients treated with androgens may be at an increased risk for the development of prostatic hyperplasia and prostatic carcinoma.



 Geriatric patients and other patients with clinical or demographic characteristics that are recognized to be associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer should be evaluated for the presence of prostate cancer prior to initiation of testosterone replacement therapy.



 In men receiving testosterone replacement therapy, surveillance for prostate cancer should be consistent with current practices for eugonadal men.



    Pregnancy Category X



  (see  CONTRAINDICATIONS  )



    Teratogenic Effects



  Striant  (r)  is not indicated for women and must not be used in women.



    Labor and Delivery



  Striant  (r)  is not indicated for women and must not be used in women.



    Nursing Mothers



  Striant  (r)  is not indicated for women and must not be used in women.



    Pediatric Use



  Safety and effectiveness in pediatric male patients below the age of 18 have not yet been established



    Geriatric Use



  Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of Striant  (r)  , 51 patients (16.5 percent) were 65 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. However, in Study 1, in patients 65 years of age and older, the total testosterone Cavg(0-24)value was higher by 12.7% compared to patients less than 65 years of age. In addition, the total T to DHT area-under-the curve ratio was lower in the older population compared to the younger population by 15.6%. These differences may not be clinically significant.

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings">    WARNINGS



    *  Prolonged use of high doses of orally active 17-alpha-alkyl androgens (e.g., methyltestosterone) have been associated with serious hepatic adverse effects (peliosis hepatis, hepatic neoplasms, cholestatic hepatitis, and jaundice). Peliosis hepatis can be a life-threatening or fatal complication. Long-term therapy with testosterone enanthate, which elevates blood levels for prolonged periods, has produced multiple hepatic adenomas. Testosterone is not known to produce these adverse effects. 
 *  Geriatric patients treated with androgens may be at an increased risk for the development of prostatic hyperplasia and prostatic carcinoma. 
 *  Geriatric patients and other patients with clinical or demographic characteristics that are recognized to be associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer should be evaluated for the presence of prostate cancer prior to initiation of testosterone replacement therapy. In men receiving testosterone replacement therapy, surveillance for prostate cancer should be consistent with current practices for eugonadal men (see  PRECAUTIONS: Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  and  Laboratory Tests  ). 
 *  Edema with or without congestive heart failure may be a serious complication in patients with preexisting cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease. In addition to discontinuation of the drug, diuretic therapy may be required. 
 *  Gynecomastia frequently develops and occasionally persists in patients being treated for hypogonadism. 
 *  The treatment of hypogonadal men with testosterone esters may potentiate sleep apnea in some patients especially those with risk factors such as obesity or chronic lung diseases.
