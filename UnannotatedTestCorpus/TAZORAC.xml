      To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Allergan, Inc. at 1-800-678-1605 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.  
 

 

    6.1 Clinical Trials Experience  

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



   Psoriasis  



 A total of 439 subjects 14 to 87 years of age were treated with TAZORAC Gel, 0.05% and 0.1% in two controlled clinical trials. The most frequent adverse events reported with TAZORAC Gel, 0.05% and 0.1% occurring in 10 to 30% of subjects, in descending order, included pruritus, burning/stinging, erythema, worsening of psoriasis, irritation, and skin pain. Reactions occurring in 1 to 10% of subjects included rash, desquamation, irritant contact dermatitis, skin inflammation, fissuring, bleeding, and dry skin. Increases in "psoriasis worsening" and "sun-induced erythema" were noted in some subjects over the 4th to 12th months of treatment as compared to the first three months of a 1 year study. In general, the incidence of adverse events with TAZORAC Gel 0.05% was 2 to 5% lower than that seen with TAZORAC Gel 0.1%.



   Acne  



 A total of 596 subjects 12 to 44 years of age were treated with TAZORAC Gel, 0.05% and 0.1% in two controlled clinical trials. The most frequent adverse events reported during clinical trials with TAZORAC Gel, 0.1% in the treatment of acne occurring in 10 to 30% of subjects, in descending order, included desquamation, burning/stinging, dry skin, erythema and pruritus. Reactions occurring in 1 to 10% of subjects included irritation, skin pain, fissuring, localized edema and skin discoloration.



     6.2    Postmarketing Experience  

  Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of tazarotene.



   Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders  : blister, dermatitis, urticaria, skin exfoliation, skin discoloration (including skin hyperpigmentation or skin hypopigmentation), swelling at or near application sites, and pain.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">     5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  



   EXCERPT:    *  Embryofetal Toxicity: TAZORAC Gel   contains tazarotene, which is a teratogen.   TAZORAC     Gel is contraindicated in pregnancy. Females of child-bearing potential should have a negative pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to initiating treatment and use an effective method of contraception during treatment. (  5.1  ) 
 *  Local Irritation: Excessive pruritus, burning, skin redness or peeling can occur. If these reactions occur, discontinue until the integrity of the skin has been restored, or consider reducing dosing frequency or in the case of psoriasis, consider switching to the lower concentration. TAZORAC Gel should not be used on eczematous skin, as it may cause severe irritation. (  5.2  ) 
 *  Photosensitivity and Risk for Sunburn: Avoid exposure to sunlight, sunlamps, and weather extremes. Wear sunscreen daily. TAZORAC     Gel should be administered with caution if the patient is also taking drugs known to be photosensitizers. (  5.3  ) 
    
 

    5.1 Embryofetal Toxicity  



  Based on data from animal reproduction studies, retinoid pharmacology and the potential for systemic absorption, TAZORAC Gel may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated during pregnancy. Tazarotene elicits malformations and developmental effects associated with retinoids after topical and oral administration to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis.



 Systemic exposure to tazarotenic acid is dependent upon the extent of the body surface area treated. In patients treated topically over sufficient body surface area, exposure could be in the same order of magnitude as in orally treated animals.



 Although there may be less systemic exposure in the treatment of acne of the face alone due to less surface area for application, tazarotene is a teratogenic substance and causes fetal malformations in animals, and it is not known what level of exposure is required for teratogenicity in humans [see Clinical Pharmacology (     12.3     )].  



 There were thirteen reported pregnancies in subjects who participated in the clinical trials for topical tazarotene. Nine of the subjects had been treated with topical tazarotene, and the other four had been treated with vehicle. One of the subjects who was treated with tazarotene cream  elected to terminate the pregnancy for non-medical reasons unrelated to treatment. The other eight pregnant women who were inadvertently exposed to topical tazarotene during the clinical trials subsequently delivered apparently healthy babies. As the exact timing and extent of exposure in relation to the gestation times are not certain, the significance of these findings is unknown.



  Females of Child-bearing Potential  



 Females of child-bearing potential should be warned of the potential risk and use adequate birth-control measures when TAZORAC Gel is used. The possibility that a female of child-bearing potential is pregnant at the time of institution of therapy should be considered.



 A negative result for pregnancy test should be obtained within 2 weeks prior to TAZORAC Gel therapy. TAZORAC Gel therapy should begin during a normal menstrual period  [see Use in Specific Populations (     8.1     )].  



     5.2 Local Irritation and Hypersensitivity Reactions  



  Application of TAZORAC Gel may cause excessive irritation in the skin of certain sensitive individuals. Local reactions (including blistering and skin desquamation, pruritus, burning, erythema) and hypersensitivity adverse reactions (including urticaria) have been observed with topical tazarotene.



 If these adverse reactions occur, consider discontinuing the medication or reducing the dosing frequency, as appropriate, until the integrity of the skin is restored.  Alternatively, patients with psoriasis who are being treated with the 0.1% concentration can be switched to the lower concentration. Frequency of application should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance.  Therapy can be resumed, or the drug concentration or frequency of application can be increased as the patient becomes able to tolerate treatment.



 Concomitant topical medications and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect should be avoided. It is also advisable to "rest" a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before treatment with TAZORAC Gel is initiated.



 TAZORAC Gel, should not be used on eczematous skin, as it may cause severe irritation.



 Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, may be more irritating to patients using TAZORAC Gel.



     5.3 Photosensitivity and Risk for Sunburn  



  Because of heightened burning susceptibility, exposure to sunlight (including sunlamps) should be avoided unless deemed medically necessary, and in such cases, exposure should be minimized during the use of TAZORAC Gel. Patients must be warned to use sunscreens and protective clothing when using TAZORAC Gel. Patients with sunburn should be advised not to use TAZORAC Gel until fully recovered. Patients who may have considerable sun exposure due to their occupation and those patients with inherent sensitivity to sunlight should exercise particular caution when using TAZORAC Gel.



 TAZORAC Gel should be administered with caution if the patient is also taking drugs known to be photosensitizers (e.g., thiazides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, phenothiazines, sulfonamides) because of the increased possibility of augmented photosensitivity.
