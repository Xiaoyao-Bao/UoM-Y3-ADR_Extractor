  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 All patients in the safety data described below had moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis.



 The safety of KEVZARA in combination with conventional DMARDs was evaluated based on data from seven studies, of which two were placebo-controlled, consisting of 2887 patients (long-term safety population). Of these, 2170 patients received KEVZARA for at least 24 weeks, 1546 for at least 48 weeks, 1020 for at least 96 weeks, and 624 for at least 144 weeks.



 The pre-rescue placebo-controlled population includes patients from the two Phase 3 efficacy studies (Studies 1 and 2) from weeks 0 to 16 for Study 1 and weeks 0 to 12 for Study 2, and was used to assess common adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities prior to patients being permitted to switch from placebo to KEVZARA. In this population, 582 patients, 579 patients, and 579 patients received KEVZARA 200 mg, KEVZARA 150 mg, or placebo once every two weeks, respectively, in combination with conventional DMARDs.



 The 52-week placebo-controlled population includes patients from one Phase 2 study of 12 week duration and two Phase 3 efficacy studies (one of 24 week duration and the other of 52 week duration). This placebo-controlled population includes all subjects from the double-blind, placebo-controlled periods from each study and was analyzed under their original randomization assignment. In this population, 661 patients, 660 patients, and 661 patients received KEVZARA 200 mg, KEVZARA 150 mg, or placebo once every two weeks, respectively, in combination with conventional DMARDs.



 Most safety data are described for the pre-rescue population. For rarer events, the 52-week placebo-controlled population is used.



 The most common serious adverse reactions were infections  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ].  



 The most frequent adverse reactions (occurring in at least 3% of patients treated with KEVZARA in combination with DMARDs) observed with KEVZARA in the clinical studies were neutropenia, increased ALT, injection site erythema, upper respiratory infections, and urinary tract infections.



 In the pre-rescue placebo-controlled population, premature discontinuation due to adverse reactions occurred in 8%, 6% and 3% of patients treated with KEVZARA 200 mg, KEVZARA 150 mg, and placebo, respectively.



 The most common adverse reaction (greater than 1%) that resulted in discontinuation of therapy with KEVZARA was neutropenia.



 The use of KEVZARA as monotherapy was assessed in 132 patients, of which 67 received KEVZARA 200 mg and 65 patients received KEVZARA 150 mg without concomitant DMARDs. The safety profile was generally consistent with that in the population receiving concomitant DMARDs.



     Overall Infections  



 In the pre-rescue placebo-controlled population, the rate of infections in the 200 mg and 150 mg KEVZARA + DMARD group was 110 and 105 events per 100 patient-years, respectively, compared to 81 events per 100 patient-years in the placebo + DMARD group. The most commonly reported infections (2% to 4% of patients) were upper respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, and nasopharyngitis.



 In the 52-week placebo-controlled population, 0.8% of patients (5 patients) treated with KEVZARA 200 mg + DMARD, 0.6% (4 patients) treated with KEVZARA 150 mg + DMARD and 0.5% (3 patients) treated with placebo + DMARD had an event of herpes zoster  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  .



 The overall rate of infections with KEVZARA + DMARD in the long-term safety population was consistent with rates in the controlled periods of the studies.



     Serious Infections  



 In the pre-rescue population, the rate of serious infections in the 200 mg and 150 mg KEVZARA + DMARD group was 3.8 and 4.4 events per 100 patient-years, respectively, compared to 2.5 events per 100 patient-years in the placebo + DMARD group. In the 52-week placebo-controlled population, the rate of serious infections in the 200 mg and 150 mg KEVZARA + DMARD group was 4.3 and 3.0 events per 100 patient-years, respectively, compared to 3.1 events per 100 patient-years in the placebo + DMARD group.



 In the long-term safety population, the overall rate of serious infections was consistent with rates in the controlled periods of the studies. The most frequently observed serious infections included pneumonia and cellulitis. Cases of opportunistic infection have been reported  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  .



     Gastrointestinal Perforation  



 In the 52-week placebo-controlled population, one patient on KEVZARA therapy experienced a gastrointestinal (GI) perforation (0.11 events per 100 patient-years).



 In the long-term safety population, the overall rate of GI perforation was consistent with rates in the controlled periods of the studies. Reports of GI perforation were primarily reported as complications of diverticulitis including lower GI perforation and abscess. Most patients who developed GI perforations were taking concomitant nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) or corticosteroids. The contribution of these concomitant medications relative to KEVZARA in the development of GI perforations is not known  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  .



     Hypersensitivity Reactions  



 In the pre-rescue placebo-controlled population, the proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to hypersensitivity reactions was higher among those treated with KEVZARA (0.3% in 200 mg, 0.2% in 150 mg) than placebo (0%). The rate of discontinuations due to hypersensitivity in the long-term safety population was consistent with the placebo-controlled period.



     Injection Site Reactions  



 In the pre-rescue placebo-controlled population, injection site reactions were reported in 7% of patients receiving KEVZARA 200 mg, 6% receiving KEVZARA 150 mg, and 1% receiving placebo. These injection site reactions (including erythema and pruritus) were mild in severity for the majority of patients and necessitated drug discontinuation in 2 (0.2%) patients receiving KEVZARA.



     Laboratory Abnormalities  



   Decreased neutrophil count



 In the pre-rescue placebo-controlled population, decreases in neutrophil counts less than 1000 per mm  3  occurred in 6% and 4% of patients in the 200 mg KEVZARA + DMARD and 150 mg KEVZARA + DMARD group, respectively, compared to no patients in the placebo + DMARD groups. Decreases in neutrophil counts less than 500 per mm  3  occurred in 0.7% of patients in both the 200 mg KEVZARA + DMARD and 150 mg KEVZARA + DMARD groups. Decrease in ANC was not associated with the occurrence of infections, including seriou  s  infections.



 In the long-term safety population, the observations on neutrophil counts were consistent with what was seen in the placebo-controlled clinical studies  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]  .



   Decreased platelet count



 In the pre-rescue placebo-controlled population, decreases in platelet counts less than 100,000 per mm  3  occurred in 1% and 0.7% of patients on 200 mg and 150 mg KEVZARA + DMARD, respectively, compared to no patients on placebo + DMARD, without associated bleeding events.



 In the long-term safety population, the observations on platelet counts were consistent with what was seen in the placebo-controlled clinical studies  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]  .



   Elevated liver enzymes



 Liver enzyme elevations in the pre-rescue placebo-controlled population (KEVZARA + DMARD or placebo + DMARD) are summarized in Table 2. In patients experiencing liver enzyme elevation, modification of treatment regimen, such as interruption of KEVZARA or reduction in dose, resulted in decrease or normalization of liver enzymes  [see  Dosage and Administration (2.4)  ]  . These elevations were not associated with clinically relevant increases in direct bilirubin, nor were they associated with clinical evidence of hepatitis or hepatic impairment  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]  .

            Lipid Abnormalities
 

 Lipid parameters (LDL, HDL, and triglycerides) were first assessed at 4 weeks following initiation of KEVZARA + DMARDs in the placebo-controlled population. Increases were observed at this time point with no additional increases observed thereafter. Changes in lipid parameters from baseline to Week 4 are summarized below:



 *  Mean LDL increased by 12 mg/dL in the KEVZARA 150 mg every two weeks + DMARD group and 16 mg/dL in the KEVZARA 200 mg every two weeks + DMARD group. 
 *  Mean triglycerides increased by 20 mg/dL in the KEVZARA 150 mg every two weeks + DMARD group and 27 mg/dL in the KEVZARA 200 mg every two weeks + DMARD group. 
 *  Mean HDL increased by 3 mg/dL in both the KEVZARA 150 mg every two weeks + DMARD and KEVZARA 200 mg every two weeks + DMARD groups. 
    In the long-term safety population, the observations in lipid parameters were consistent with what was observed in the placebo-controlled clinical studies.
 

     Malignancies  



 In the 52-week placebo-controlled population, 9 malignancies (exposure-adjusted event rate of 1.0 event per 100 patient-years) were diagnosed in patients receiving KEVZARA+ DMARD compared to 4 malignancies in patients in the control group (exposure-adjusted event rate of 1.0 event per 100 patient-years).



 In the long-term safety population, the rate of malignancies was consistent with the rate observed in the placebo-controlled period  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.4)  ]  .



     Other Adverse Reactions  



 Adverse reactions occurring in 2% or more of patients on KEVZARA + DMARD and greater than those observed in patients on placebo + DMARD are summarized in Table 3.

   6.2 Immunogenicity

  As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to sarilumab in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading.



 In the pre-rescue population, 4.0% of patients treated with KEVZARA 200 mg + DMARD, 5.7% of patients treated with KEVZARA 150 mg + DMARD and 1.9% of patients treated with placebo + DMARD, exhibited an anti-drug antibody (ADA) response. Neutralizing antibodies (NAb) were detected in 1.0% of patients on KEVZARA 200 mg + DMARD, 1.6% of patients on KEVZARA 150 mg + DMARD, and 0.2% of patients on placebo + DMARD.



 In patients treated with KEVZARA monotherapy, 9.2% of patients exhibited an ADA response with 6.9% of patients also exhibiting NAbs. Prior to administration of KEVZARA, 2.3% of patients exhibited an ADA response.



 No correlation was observed between ADA development and either loss of efficacy or adverse reactions.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: RISK OF SERIOUS INFECTIONS

    WARNING: RISK OF SERIOUS INFECTIONS  

    Patients treated with KEVZARA are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ,   Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].   Opportunistic infections have also been reported in patients receiving KEVZARA. Most patients who developed infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids.   



   Avoid use of KEVZARA in patients with an active infection.  



   Reported infections include:   



 *  Active tuberculosis, which may present with pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease. Patients should be tested for latent tuberculosis before KEVZARA use and during therapy. Treatment for latent infection should be initiated prior to KEVZARA use. 
 *  Invasive fungal infections, such as candidiasis, and pneumocystis. Patients with invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease. 
 *  Bacterial, viral and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens. 
      Closely monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection during treatment with KEVZARA. If a serious infection develops, interrupt KEVZARA until the infection is controlled.  
 

   Consider the risks and benefits of treatment with KEVZARA prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection.  



   EXCERPT:   WARNING: RISK OF SERIOUS INFECTIONS



   See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning  .



 *  Serious infections leading to hospitalization or death including bacterial, viral, invasive fungal, and other opportunistic infections have occurred in patients receiving KEVZARA. (5.1) 
 *  If a serious infection develops, interrupt KEVZARA until the infection is controlled. (5.1) 
 *  Cases of tuberculosis (TB) have been reported. Prior to starting KEVZARA, test for latent TB; if positive, start treatment for TB. (5.1) 
 *  Closely monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection during treatment with KEVZARA. (5.1)

 *  Live vaccines: Avoid use with KEVZARA due to the risk of infection. Follow vaccination guidelines. (  5.7  ,  7.3  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Serious Infections



  Serious and sometimes fatal infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, or other opportunistic pathogens have been reported in patients receiving immunosuppressive agents including KEVZARA for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The most frequently observed serious infections with KEVZARA included pneumonia and cellulitis [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Among opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, candidiasis, and pneumocystis were reported with KEVZARA. Some patients presented with disseminated rather than localized disease and were often taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids, which in addition to RA may predispose them to infections. While not reported in KEVZARA clinical studies, other serious infections (e.g., histoplasmosis, cryptococcus, aspergillosis) have been reported in patients receiving other immunosuppressive agents for the treatment of RA.



 Avoid use of KEVZARA in patients with an active infection, including localized infections. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating KEVZARA in patients who have:



 *  chronic or recurrent infection; 
 *  a history of serious or opportunistic infections; 
 *  underlying conditions, in addition to RA, that may predispose them to infection; 
 *  been exposed to tuberculosis; or 
 *  lived in or traveled to areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses. 
    Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during treatment with KEVZARA, as signs and symptoms of acute inflammation may be lessened due to suppression of the acute phase reactants [see  Dosage and Administration (2.4)  ,  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .
 

 Hold treatment with KEVZARA if a patient develops a serious infection or an opportunistic infection.



 Perform prompt and complete diagnostic testing appropriate for an immunocompromised patient who develops a new infection during treatment with KEVZARA; initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy, and closely monitor the patient.



    Tuberculosis  



 Evaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) risk factors and test for latent infection prior to initiating treatment with KEVZARA. Treat patients with latent TB with standard antimycobacterial therapy before initiating KEVZARA. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiation of KEVZARA in patients with a past history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent TB but having risk factors for TB infection. When considering anti-TB therapy, consultation with a physician with expertise in TB may be appropriate.



 Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of TB including patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy.



    Viral Reactivation  



 Viral reactivation has been reported with immunosuppressive biologic therapies. Cases of herpes zoster were observed in clinical studies with KEVZARA [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . The risk of Hepatitis B reactivation with KEVZARA is unknown since patients who were at risk for reactivation were excluded.



    5.2 Laboratory Abnormalities



   Neutropenia  



 Treatment with KEVZARA was associated with a higher incidence of decrease in absolute neutrophil count (ANC), including neutropenia [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



 *  Assess neutrophil count prior to initiation of KEVZARA and monitor neutrophil count 4 to 8 weeks after start of therapy and every 3 months thereafter [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)  ] . For recommendations regarding initiating KEVZARA therapy and dosage modifications based on ANC results see   Dosage and Administration (2.2  and  2.4)   . 
 *  Based on the pharmacodynamics of the changes in ANC [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)  ] , use results obtained at the end of the dosing interval when considering dose modification. 
       Thrombocytopenia  
 

 Treatment with KEVZARA was associated with a reduction in platelet counts in clinical studies [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



 *  Assess platelet count prior to initiation of KEVZARA and monitor platelets 4 to 8 weeks after start of therapy and every 3 months thereafter. For recommendations regarding initiating KEVZARA therapy and dosage modifications based on platelet counts see   Dosage and Administration (2.2  and  2.4)   . 
       Elevated Liver Enzymes  
 

 Treatment with KEVZARA was associated with a higher incidence of transaminase elevations. These elevations were transient and did not result in any clinically evident hepatic injury in clinical studies [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Increased frequency and magnitude of these elevations were observed when potentially hepatotoxic drugs (e.g., MTX) were used in combination with KEVZARA.



 *  Assess ALT/AST levels prior to initiation of KEVZARA and monitor ALT and AST levels 4 to 8 weeks after start of therapy and every 3 months thereafter. When clinically indicated, consider other liver function tests such as bilirubin. For recommendations regarding initiating KEVZARA therapy and dosage modifications based on transaminase elevations see   Dosage and Administration (2.2  and  2.4)   . 
       Lipid Abnormalities  
 

 Treatment with KEVZARA was associated with increases in lipid parameters such as LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and/or triglycerides [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



 *  Assess lipid parameters approximately 4 to 8 weeks following initiation of treatment with KEVZARA, then at approximately 6 month intervals. 
 *  Manage patients according to clinical guidelines for the management of hyperlipidemia. 
       5.3 Gastrointestinal Perforation
 

  Gastrointestinal perforations have been reported in clinical studies, primarily as complications of diverticulitis. GI perforation risk may be increased with concurrent diverticulitis or concomitant use of NSAIDs or corticosteroids. Promptly evaluate patients presenting with new onset abdominal symptoms [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



    5.4 Immunosuppression



  Treatment with immunosuppressants may result in an increased risk of malignancies. The impact of treatment with KEVZARA on the development of malignancies is not known but malignancies were reported in clinical studies [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



    5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions



  Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in association with KEVZARA [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  Hypersensitivity reactions that required treatment discontinuation were reported in 0.3% of patients in controlled RA trials. Injection site rash, rash, and urticaria were the most frequent hypersensitivity reactions. Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if they experience any symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction. If anaphylaxis or other hypersensitivity reaction occurs, stop administration of KEVZARA immediately. Do not administer KEVZARA to patients with known hypersensitivity to sarilumab [see  Contraindications (4)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



    5.6 Active Hepatic Disease and Hepatic Impairment



  Treatment with KEVZARA is not recommended in patients with active hepatic disease or hepatic impairment, as treatment with KEVZARA was associated with transaminase elevations [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ,  Use in Specific Populations (8.6)  ]  .



    5.7 Live Vaccines



  Avoid concurrent use of live vaccines during treatment with KEVZARA due to potentially increased risk of infections; clinical safety of live vaccines during KEVZARA treatment has not been established. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection from persons receiving live vaccines to patients receiving KEVZARA. The interval between live vaccinations and initiation of KEVZARA therapy should be in accordance with current vaccination guidelines regarding immunosuppressive agents [see  Drug Interactions (7.3)  ]  .
