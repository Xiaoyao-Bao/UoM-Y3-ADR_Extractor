  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     Clinical Studies  

    Hypercalcemia of Malignancy  

  Transient mild elevation of temperature by at least 1 degrees C was noted 24 to 48 hours after administration of Aredia in 34% of patients in clinical trials. In the saline trial, 18% of patients had a temperature elevation of at least 1 degrees C 24 to 48 hours after treatment.



 Drug-related local soft-tissue symptoms (redness, swelling or induration and pain on palpation) at the site of catheter insertion were most common in patients treated with 90 mg of Aredia. Symptomatic treatment resulted in rapid resolution in all patients.



 Rare cases of uveitis, iritis, scleritis, and episcleritis have been reported, including one case of scleritis, and one case of uveitis upon separate rechallenges.



 Five of 231 patients (2%) who received Aredia during the four U.S. controlled hypercalcemia clinical studies were reported to have had seizures, 2 of whom had preexisting seizure disorders. None of the seizures were considered to be drug-related by the investigators. However, a possible relationship between the drug and the occurrence of seizures cannot be ruled out. It should be noted that in the saline arm 1 patient (4%) had a seizure.



 There are no controlled clinical trials comparing the efficacy and safety of 90-mg Aredia over 24 hours to 2 hours in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy. However, a comparison of data from separate clinical trials suggests that the overall safety profile in patients who received 90-mg Aredia over 24 hours is similar to those who received 90-mg Aredia over 2 hours. The only notable differences observed were an increase in the proportion of patients in the Aredia 24-hour group who experienced fluid overload and electrolyte/mineral abnormalities.



 At least 15% of patients treated with Aredia for hypercalcemia of malignancy also experienced the following adverse events during a clinical trial:



   General:  Fluid overload, generalized pain



   Cardiovascular:       Hypertension



   Gastrointestinal:  Abdominal pain, anorexia, constipation, nausea, vomiting



   Genitourinary:  Urinary tract infection



   Musculoskeletal:  Bone pain



   Laboratory Abnormality:  Anemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia



 Many of these adverse experiences may have been related to the underlying disease state.



 The following table lists the adverse experiences considered to be treatment-related during comparative, controlled U.S. trials.

                Paget's Disease  
   Transient mild elevation of temperature &gt;1 degrees C above pretreatment baseline was noted within 48 hours after completion of treatment in 21% of the patients treated with 90 mg of Aredia in clinical trials.



 Drug-related musculoskeletal pain and nervous system symptoms (dizziness, headache, paresthesia, increased sweating) were more common in patients with Paget's disease treated with 90 mg of Aredia than in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy treated with the same dose.



 Adverse experiences considered to be related to trial drug, which occurred in at least 5% of patients with Paget's disease treated with 90 mg of Aredia in two U.S. clinical trials, were fever, nausea, back pain, and bone pain.



 At least 10% of all Aredia-treated patients with Paget's disease also experienced the following adverse experiences during clinical trials:



   Cardiovascular:  Hypertension



   Musculoskeletal:  Arthrosis, bone pain



   Nervous system:  Headache



 Most of these adverse experiences may have been related to the underlying disease state.



     Osteolytic Bone Metastases of Breast Cancer and Osteolytic Lesions of Multiple Myeloma  

  The most commonly reported (&gt;15%) adverse experiences occurred with similar frequencies in the Aredia- and placebo-treatment groups, and most of these adverse experiences may have been related to the underlying disease state or cancer therapy.

              Of the toxicities commonly associated with chemotherapy, the frequency of vomiting, anorexia, and anemia were slightly more common in the Aredia patients whereas stomatitis and alopecia occurred at a frequency similar to that in placebo patients. In the breast cancer trials, mild elevations of serum creatinine occurred in 18.5% of Aredia patients and 12.3% of placebo patients. Mineral and electrolyte disturbances, including hypocalcemia, were reported rarely and in similar percentages of Aredia-treated patients compared with those in the placebo group. The reported frequencies of hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia for Aredia-treated patients were 3.3%, 10.5%, 1.7%, and 4.4%, respectively, and for placebo-treated patients were 1.2%, 12%, 1.7%, and 4.5%, respectively. In previous hypercalcemia of malignancy trials, patients treated with Aredia (60 or 90 mg over 24 hours) developed electrolyte abnormalities more frequently (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Hypercalcemia of Malignancy).
 

 Arthralgias and myalgias were reported slightly more frequently in the Aredia group than in the placebo group (13.6% and 26% vs 10.8% and 20.1%, respectively).



 In multiple myeloma patients, there were five Aredia-related serious and unexpected adverse experiences. Four of these were reported during the 12-month extension of the multiple myeloma trial. Three of the reports were of worsening renal function developing in patients with progressive multiple myeloma or multiple myeloma-associated amyloidosis. The fourth report was the adult respiratory distress syndrome developing in a patient recovering from pneumonia and acute gangrenous cholecystitis. One Aredia-treated patient experienced an allergic reaction characterized by swollen and itchy eyes, runny nose, and scratchy throat within 24 hours after the sixth infusion.



 In the breast cancer trials, there were four Aredia-related adverse experiences, all moderate in severity, that caused a patient to discontinue participation in the trial. One was due to interstitial pneumonitis, another to malaise and dyspnea. One Aredia patient discontinued the trial due to a symptomatic hypocalcemia. Another Aredia patient discontinued therapy due to severe bone pain after each infusion, which the investigator felt was trial-drug-related.



     Renal Toxicity  

  In a study of the safety and efficacy of Aredia 90 mg (2-hour infusion) vs Zometa 4 mg (15-minute infusion) in bone metastases patients with multiple myeloma or breast cancer, renal deterioration was defined as an increase in serum creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL for patients with normal baseline creatinine (&lt;1.4 mg/dL) or an increase of 1.0 mg/dL for patients with an abnormal baseline creatinine (&gt;=1.4 mg/dL). The following are data on the incidence of renal deterioration in patients in this trial. See table below.



 Incidence of Renal Function Deterioration in Multiple Myeloma and Breast Cancer Patients with Normal and Abnormal Serum Creatinine at Baseline* 
 Patient Population/Baseline Creatinine  Aredia  (r)  90 mg/2 hours  Zometa  (r)  4 mg/15 minutes   
                                   n/N              (%)                               n/N              (%)

               *Patients were randomized following the 15-minute infusion amendment for the Zometa arm.  
 

     Post-Marketing Experience  

  The following adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use of Aredia. Because these reports are from a population of uncertain size and are subject to confounding factors, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 The following adverse reactions have been reported in post-marketing use:  General  : reactivation of Herpes simplex and Herpes zoster, influenza-like symptoms;  CNS:  confusion and visual hallucinations, sometimes in the presence of electrolyte imbalance;  Skin:  rash, pruritus;  Special senses:  conjunctivitis, orbital inflammation;  Renal and urinary disorders:  focal segmental glomerulosclerosis including the collapsing variant, nephrotic syndrome; renal tubular disorders (RTD); tubulointerstitial nephritis, and glomerulonephropathies.  Laboratory abnormalities:  hyperkalemia, hypernatremia, hematuria. Rare instances of allergic manifestations have been reported, including hypotension, dyspnea, or angioedema, and, very rarely, anaphylactic shock. Aredia is contraindicated in patients with clinically significant hypersensitivity to Aredia or other bisphosphonates (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).  Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders:  adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), interstitial lung disease (ILD).  Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders:  severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain.



 Cases of osteonecrosis (primarily involving the jaw) have been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates, including Aredia. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be risk factors for ONJ. Data suggest a greater frequency of reports of ONJ in certain cancers, such as advanced breast cancer and multiple myeloma. The majority of the reported cases are in cancer patients following invasive dental procedures, such as tooth extraction. It is therefore prudent to avoid invasive dental procedures as recovery may be prolonged. (See PRECAUTIONS.)



 Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported with bisphosphonate therapy, including Aredia. (See PRECAUTIONS.)

    <Section id="S2" name="precautions">     PRECAUTIONS  



    General  



  Standard hypercalcemia-related metabolic parameters, such as serum levels of calcium, phosphate, magnesium, and potassium, should be carefully monitored following initiation of therapy with Aredia. Cases of asymptomatic hypophosphatemia (12%), hypokalemia (7%), hypomagnesemia (11%), and hypocalcemia (5%-12%), were reported in Aredia-treated patients. Rare cases of symptomatic hypocalcemia (including tetany) have been reported in association with Aredia therapy. If hypocalcemia occurs, short-term calcium therapy may be necessary. In Paget's disease of bone, 17% of patients treated with 90 mg of Aredia showed serum calcium levels below 8 mg/dL.



 Patients with a history of thyroid surgery may have relative hypoparathyroidism that may predispose to hypocalcemia with Aredia.



     Renal Insufficiency  



  Aredia is excreted intact primarily via the kidney, and the risk of renal adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Patients who receive Aredia should have serum creatinine assessed prior to each treatment. In patients receiving Aredia for bone metastases, who show evidence of deterioration in renal function, Aredia treatment should be withheld until renal function returns to baseline (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).



  In clinical trials, patients with re   n   al impairment (serum creatinine &gt;3.0 mg/dL) have not been studied. Limited pharmacokinetic data exist in patients with creatinine clearance &lt;30 ml/min (See Clinical Pharmacology, Pharmacokinetics.)  For the treatment of bone metastases, the use of Aredia in patients with severe renal impairment is not recommended. In other indications, clinical judgment should determine whether the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk in such patients.



     Osteonecrosis of the Jaw  



  Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates, including Aredia. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be risk factors for ONJ. Postmarketing experience and the literature suggest a greater frequency of reports of ONJ based on tumor type (advanced breast cancer, multiple myeloma), and dental status (dental extraction, periodontal disease, local trauma including poorly fitting dentures). Many reports of ONJ involved patients with signs of local infection including osteomyelitis.



 Cancer patients should maintain good oral hygiene and should have a dental examination with preventive dentistry prior to treatment with bisphosphonates. 



 While on treatment, these patients should avoid invasive dental procedures if possible. For patients who develop ONJ while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition. For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of ONJ. Clinical judgment of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment (See Adverse Reactions).



     Musculoskeletal Pain  



  In post-marketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates. This category of drugs includes Aredia (pamidronate disodium for injection). The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate.



     Atypical fractures of the femur  



  Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy, including Aredia. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to just above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. These fractures occur after minimal or no trauma. Patients may experience thigh or groin pain weeks to months before presenting with a completed femoral fracture. Fractures are often bilateral; therefore the contralateral femur should be examined in bisphosphonate-treated patients who have sustained a femoral shaft fracture. Poor healing of these fractures has also been reported. A number of case reports noted that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (such as prednisone or dexamethasone) at the time of fracture. Causality with bisphosphonate therapy has not been established.



 Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain in the absence of trauma should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated. Discontinuation of Aredia therapy in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture should be considered pending evaluation of the patient, based on an individual benefit risk assessment. It is unknown whether the risk of atypical femur fracture continues after stopping therapy.



     Laboratory Tests  



  Patients who receive Aredia should have serum creatinine assessed prior to each treatment. Serum calcium, electrolytes, phosphate, magnesium, and CBC, differential, and hematocrit/hemoglobin must be closely monitored in patients treated with Aredia. Patients who have preexisting anemia, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia should be monitored carefully in the first 2 weeks following treatment. Patients receiving Aredia may be at risk for anemia, leukopenia or thrombocytopenia and should have regular hematology assessments.



     Drug Interactions  



  Concomitant administration of a loop diuretic had no effect on the calcium-lowering action of Aredia.



 Caution is indicated when Aredia is used with other potentially nephrotoxic drugs.



 In multiple myeloma patients, the risk of renal function deterioration may be increased when Aredia is used in combination with thalidomide.



     Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  



  In a 104-week carcinogenicity study with daily oral administration of pamidronate in rats, there was a positive dose response relationship for benign adrenal pheochromocytoma in males (P&lt;0.00001). Although this condition was also observed in females, the incidence was not statistically significant. When the dose calculations were adjusted to account for the limited oral bioavailability of pamidronate in rats, systemic exposure with the lowest daily dose associated with adrenal pheochromocytoma resulted in systemic exposures that were similar to the systemic exposure achieved at the intended clinical dose. Adrenal pheochromocytoma was also observed in low numbers in the control animals and is considered a relatively common spontaneous neoplasm in the rat. Pamidronate given daily by oral administration was not carcinogenic in an 80-week study in mice.



 Pamidronate was nonmutagenic in six mutagenicity assays, including: the Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay, (with and without metabolic activation), nucleus-anomaly test, sister-chromatid-exchange study, point-mutation test, and micronucleus test in the rat.



 In rats, decreased fertility occurred in first-generation offspring of parents who had received 150 mg/kg of pamidronate orally; however, this occurred only when animals were mated with members of the same dose group. Pamidronate has not been administered intravenously in such a study.



     Animal Toxicology  



  In both rats and dogs, nephropathy has been associated with intravenous (bolus and infusion) administration of pamidronate.



 Two 7-day intravenous infusion studies were conducted in the dog wherein pamidronate was given for 1, 4, or 24 hours at doses of 1-20 mg/kg for up to 7 days. In the first study, the compound was well tolerated at 3 mg/kg (1.7 x highest recommended human dose [HRHD] for a single intravenous infusion) when administered for 4 or 24 hours, but renal findings such as elevated BUN and creatinine levels and renal tubular necrosis occurred when 3 mg/kg was infused for 1 hour and at doses of &gt;=10 mg/kg. In the second study, slight renal tubular necrosis was observed in 1 male at 1 mg/kg when infused for 4 hours. Additional findings included elevated BUN levels in several treated animals and renal tubular dilation and/or inflammation at &gt;=1 mg/kg after each infusion time.



 Pamidronate was given to rats at doses of 2, 6, and 20 mg/kg and to dogs at doses of 2, 4, 6, and 20 mg/kg as a 1-hour infusion, once a week, for 3 months followed by a 1-month recovery period. In rats, nephrotoxicity was observed at &gt;=6 mg/kg and included increased BUN and creatinine levels and tubular degeneration and necrosis. These findings were still present at 20 mg/kg at the end of the recovery period. In dogs, moribundity/death and renal toxicity occurred at 20 mg/kg as did kidney findings of elevated BUN and creatinine levels at &gt;=6 mg/kg and renal tubular degeneration at &gt;=4 mg/kg. The kidney changes were partially reversible at 6 mg/kg. In both studies, the dose level that produced no adverse renal effects was considered to be 2 mg/kg (1.1 x HRHD for a single intravenous infusion).



     Pregnancy Category D (  See WARNINGS )  



  There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.



 Aredia may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Bisphosphonates, such as Aredia, are incorporated into the bone matrix, from where they are gradually released over periods of weeks to years. The extent of bisphosphonate incorporation into adult bone, and hence, the amount available for release back into the systemic circulation, is directly related to the total dose and duration of bisphosphonate use. Although there are no data on fetal risk in humans, bisphosphonates do cause fetal harm in animals, and animal data suggest that uptake of bisphosphonates into fetal bone is greater than into maternal bone. Therefore, there is a theoretical risk of fetal harm (e.g., skeletal and other abnormalities) if a woman becomes pregnant after completing a course of bisphosphonate therapy. The impact of variables such as time between cessation of bisphosphonate therapy to conception, the particular bisphosphonate used, and the route of administration (intravenous versus oral) on this risk has not been established. If Aredia is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking or after taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.



 Intravenous bolus dosing of pregnant rats and rabbits with pamidronate resulted in maternal toxicity and embryo/fetal effects when given during organogenesis at doses of 0.6 to 8.3 times the highest recommended human dose for a single intravenous infusion. Pamidronate can cross the placenta in rats, and has produced marked maternal and nonteratogenic embryo/fetal effects in both rats and rabbits.



     Nursing Mothers  



  It is not known whether pamidronate is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Aredia, a decision should be made to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.



     Pediatric Use  



  Safety and effectiveness of Aredia in pediatric patients have not been established.



     Geriatric Use  



  Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of Aredia, approximately 20% were 65 and over, while approximately 15% were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

   Deterioration in Renal Function  



 Bisphosphonates, including Aredia, have been associated with renal toxicity manifested as deterioration of renal function and potential renal failure.



  DUE TO THE RISK OF CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN RENAL FUNCTION, WHICH MAY PROGRESS TO RENAL FAILURE, SINGLE DOSES OF AREDIA SHOULD NOT EXCEED 90 MG (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION for appropriate infusion durations). Renal deterioration, progression to renal failure, and dialysis have been reported in patients after the initial or a single dose of Aredia.  



 Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (including the collapsing variant) with or without nephrotic syndrome, which may lead to renal failure, has been reported in Aredia-treated patients, particularly in the setting of multiple myeloma and breast cancer. Some of these patients had gradual improvement in renal status after Aredia was discontinued.



 Patients who receive Aredia should have serum creatinine assessed prior to each treatment. Patients treated with Aredia for bone metastases should have the dose withheld if renal function has deteriorated. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.)
