  6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of fluorouracil. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Hematologic:  pancytopenia  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.7  )]    Gastrointestinal:  gastrointestinal ulceration, nausea, vomiting  Allergic Reactions:  anaphylaxis and generalized allergic reactions  Neurologic:  nystagmus, headache  Dermatologic:  dry skin; fissuring; photosensitivity, as manifested by erythema or increased pigmentation of the skin; vein pigmentation  Ophthalmic:  lacrimal duct stenosis, visual changes, lacrimation, photophobia  Psychiatric:  euphoria  Miscellaneous:  thrombophlebitis, epistaxis, nail changes (including loss of nails)

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *   Increased Risk of Serious or Fatal Adverse Reactions in Patients with Low or Absent Dipyrimidine Dehydrogenase Activity: Withhold or permanently discontinue fluorouracil in patients with evidence of acute early-onset or unusually severe toxicity, which may indicate near complete or total absence of dipyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) activity. No fluorouracil dose has been proven safe in patients with absent DPD activity. (  5.1  ) 
 *   Cardiotoxicity : Fluorouracil can cause cardiotoxicity, including angina, myocardial infarction/ischemia, arrhythmia, and heart failure. Withhold fluorouracil for cardiac toxicity. (  5.2  ) 
 *   Hyperammonemic Encephalopathy : Altered mental status, confusion, disorientation, coma, or ataxia with elevated serum ammonia level can occur within 72 hours of initiation of fluorouracil. Withhold fluorouracil and initiate ammonia-lowering therapy. (  5.3  ) 
 *   Neurologic Toxicity : Fluorouracil can cause acute cerebellar syndrome, confusion, disorientation, ataxia, or visual disturbances. Withhold fluorouracil for neurologic toxicity. (  5.4  ) 
 *   Diarrhea : Fluorouracil can cause severe diarrhea. Withhold fluorouracil for severe diarrhea until resolved. (  5.5  ) 
 *   Palmar-Plantar Erythrodysesthesia (Hand-Foot Syndrome) : Fluorouracil can cause hand-foot syndrome. If severe, discontinue fluorouracil until resolved or decreased to Grade 1, then resume at a reduced dose. (  5.6  ) 
 *   Myelosuppression : Fluorouracil can cause severe and fatal myelosuppression. Withhold fluorouracil until severe myelosuppression resolves, then resume at a reduced dose. (  5.7  ) 
 *   Mucositis : Fluorouracil can cause severe mucositis. Discontinue fluorouracil until resolved or decreased to Grade 1, then resume at a reduced dose. (  5.8  ) 
 *   Increased Risk of Elevated INR with Warfarin: Concurrent administration with warfarin can result in clinically significant increases in coagulation parameters: Closely monitor INR and prothrombin time. (  5.9  ) 
 *   Embryofetal Toxicity : Fluorouracil can cause fetal harm. Advise females and males of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. (  5.10  ,  8.1  ,  8.6  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Increased Risk of Serious or Fatal Adverse Reactions in Patients with Low or Absent Dipyrimidine Dehydrogenase (DPD) Activity



  Based on postmarketing reports, patients with certain homozygous or certain compound heterozygous mutations in the DPD gene that result in complete or near complete absence of DPD activity are at increased risk for acute early-onset of toxicity and severe, life-threatening, or fatal adverse reactions caused by fluorouracil (e.g., mucositis, diarrhea, neutropenia, and neurotoxicity). Patients with partial DPD activity may also have increased risk of severe, life-threatening, or fatal adverse reactions caused by fluorouracil.



 Withhold or permanently discontinue fluorouracil based on clinical assessment of the onset, duration and severity of the observed toxicities in patients with evidence of acute early-onset or unusually severe toxicity, which may indicate near complete or total absence of DPD activity. No fluorouracil dose has been proven safe for patients with complete absence of DPD activity. There is insufficient data to recommend a specific dose in patients with partial DPD activity as measured by any specific test.



    5.2 Cardiotoxicity



  Fluorouracil can cause cardiotoxicity, including angina, myocardial infarction/ischemia, arrhythmia, and heart failure, based on postmarketing reports. Reported risk factors for cardiotoxicity are administration by continuous infusion rather than intravenous bolus and presence of coronary artery disease. Withhold fluorouracil for cardiotoxicity. The risks of resumption of fluorouracil in patients with cardiotoxicity that has resolved have not been established.



    5.3 Hyperammonemic Encephalopathy



  Fluorouracil can cause hyperammonemic encephalopathy in the absence of liver disease or other identifiable cause, based on postmarketing reports. Signs or symptoms of hyperammonemic encephalopathy began within 72 hours after initiation of fluorouracil infusion; these included altered mental status, confusion, disorientation, coma, or ataxia, in the presence of concomitant elevated serum ammonia level. Withhold fluorouracil for hyperammonemic encephalopathy and initiate ammonia-lowering therapy. The risks of resumption of fluorouracil in patients with hyperammonemic encephalopathy that has resolved have not been established.



    5.4 Neurologic Toxicity



  Fluorouracil can cause neurologic toxicity, including acute cerebellar syndrome and other neurologic events, based on postmarketing reports. Neurologic symptoms included confusion, disorientation, ataxia, or visual disturbances. Withhold fluorouracil for neurologic toxicity. There are insufficient data on the risks of resumption of fluorouracil in patients with neurologic toxicity that has resolved.



    5.5 Diarrhea



  Fluorouracil can cause severe diarrhea. Withhold fluorouracil for Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea until resolved or decreased in intensity to Grade 1, then resume fluorouracil at a reduced dose. Administer fluids, electrolyte replacement, or antidiarrheal treatments as necessary.



    5.6 Palmar-Plantar Erythrodysesthesia (Hand-Foot Syndrome)



  Fluorouracil can cause palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, also known as hand-foot syndrome (HFS). Symptoms of HFS include a tingling sensation, pain, swelling, and erythema with tenderness, and desquamation. HFS occurs more commonly when fluorouracil is administered as a continuous infusion than when fluorouracil is administered as a bolus injection, and has been reported to occur more frequently in patients with previous exposure to chemotherapy. HFS is generally observed after 8 to 9 weeks of fluorouracil administration but may occur earlier. Institute supportive measures for symptomatic relief of HFS. Withhold fluorouracil administration for Grade 2 or 3 HFS; resume fluorouracil at a reduced dose when HFS is completely resolved or decreased in severity to Grade 1.



    5.7 Myelosuppression



  Fluorouracil can cause severe and fatal myelosuppression which may include neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. The nadir in neutrophil counts commonly occurs between 9 and 14 days after fluorouracil administration. Obtain complete blood counts prior to each treatment cycle, weekly if administered on a weekly or similar schedule, and as needed. Withhold fluorouracil until Grade 4 myelosuppression resolves; resume fluorouracil at a reduced dose when myelosuppression has resolved or improved to Grade 1 in severity.



    5.8 Mucositis



  Mucositis, stomatitis or esophagopharyngitis, which may lead to mucosal sloughing or ulceration, can occur with fluorouracil. The incidence is reported to be higher with administration of fluorouracil by intravenous bolus compared with administration by continuous infusion. Withhold fluorouracil administration for Grade 3 or 4 mucositis; resume fluorouracil at a reduced dose once mucositis has resolved or decreased in severity to Grade 1.



    5.9 Increased Risk of Elevated International Normalized Ratio (INR) with Warfarin



  Clinically significant elevations in coagulation parameters have been reported during concomitant use of warfarin and fluorouracil. Closely monitor patients receiving concomitant coumarin-derivative anticoagulants such as warfarin for INR or prothrombin time in order to adjust the anticoagulant dose accordingly [see Drug Interactions (  7  )]  .



    5.10 Embryofetal Toxicity



  Based on its mechanism of action, fluorouracil can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal studies, administration of fluorouracil at doses lower than a human dose of 12 mg/kg caused teratogenicity. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential and males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and for 3 months following cessation of therapy with fluorouracil [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  ,  8.6  ), Clinical Pharmacology (  12.1  ), and Nonclinical Toxicology (  13.1  )].
