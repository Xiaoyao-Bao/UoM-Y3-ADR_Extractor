  6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



     Previously Treated CML or Ph+ ALL  



 The adverse reactions described in this section were identified in a single-arm, open-label, international, multicenter trial in 449 patients with CML or Ph+ ALL whose disease was considered to be resistant or intolerant to prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy including those with the BCR-ABL T315I mutation.



 All patients received a starting dose of 45 mg Iclusig once daily. Interruptions and dose adjustments to 30 mg once daily or 15 mg once daily were allowed for the management of treatment toxicity. Additionally, after approximately 2 years of follow-up, patients who were still taking a 45 mg daily dose were recommended to undergo a dose reduction, in response to the continued occurrence of arterial occlusive events and venous thromboembolic events in the clinical trial.



 At the time of analysis (48 months of follow-up), 133 patients (30%) were ongoing (110 CP-CML; 20 AP-CML; 3 BP-CML; 0 Ph+ ALL), and the median duration of treatment with Iclusig was 32.2 months in patients with CP-CML, 19.4 months in patients with AP-CML, 2.9 months in patients with BP-CML, and 2.7 months in patients with Ph+ ALL. The median dose intensity in patients with CP-CML was 29 mg /day or 64% of the 45 mg starting dose; median dose intensity was greater in patients with advanced disease patients. Seventy one percent (318/449) of patients experienced a dose interruption of more than three days and 68% (304/449) experienced a dose reduction.



 The most common adverse reactions (&gt;=5%) that led to dose modifications (interruption or dose reduction) include thrombocytopenia (31%), neutropenia (14%), lipase increased (13%), arterial occlusive events (13%), abdominal pain (12%), rash (9%), anemia (6%), pancreatitis (6%), ALT increased (5%) and hypertension (5%).



 At the time of the analysis, 69% of the ongoing patients (92/133 patients) were reported to be receiving 15 mg; with 26% (35/133) and 5% (6/133) of Iclusig-treated patients receiving 30 mg and 45 mg, respectively.



 Adverse reactions reported in more than 10% of all patients treated with Iclusig in this trial are presented in Table 5. Overall, the most common non-hematologic adverse reactions (&gt;= 20%) were abdominal pain, rash, constipation, headache, dry skin, fatigue, hypertension, pyrexia, arthralgia, nausea, diarrhea, lipase increased, vomiting, myalgia and pain in extremity.



 The rates of treatment-emergent adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation were 19% in CP-CML, 12% in AP-CML, 15% in BP-CML, and 9% in Ph+ ALL. The most common adverse reactions that led to treatment discontinuation was thrombocytopenia (4%).

   5.1 Arterial Occlusion



   Arterial occlusions, including fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, stenosis of large arterial vessels of the brain, severe peripheral vascular disease have occurred in at least 35% of Iclusig-treated patients from the phase 1 and phase 2 trials. With a minimum of 48 months follow-up for ongoing patients (N=133) in the phase 2 trial, 33% (150/449) of Iclusig-treated patients experienced a cardiac vascular (21%), peripheral vascular (12%), or cerebrovascular (9%) arterial occlusive event; some patients experienced more than 1 type of arterial occlusive event.  



  Iclusig can cause fatal and life-threatening arterial occlusion within 2 weeks of starting treatment, and at dose levels as low as 15 mg per day. Iclusig can also cause recurrent or multi-site vascular occlusion. Patients have required revascularization procedures (coronary, cerebrovascular, and peripheral arterial).  



  In the phase 2 trial, the median time to onset of the first cardiac vascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular arterial occlusive events was 193 (range: 1 - 1355), 526 (range: 5 - 1339), and 478 (range: 3 - 1344) days, respectively.  



  Patients with and without cardiovascular risk factors, including patients age 50 years or younger, experienced these events. The most common risk factors observed in patients with arterial occlusive events were hypertension (62%; 93/150), hyperlipidemia (61%; 91/150), and history of cardiac disease (48%; 72/150). Arterial occlusion adverse events were more frequent with increasing age and in patients with history of ischemia, hypertension, diabetes, or hyperlipidemia (see  Table 4  ).

        Total                        33%(150/449)                 
          Cardiac vascular occlusion, including fatal and life-threatening myocardial infarction and coronary artery occlusion has occurred in 21% (94/449) of Iclusig-treated patients. Patients have developed heart failure concurrent or subsequent to the myocardial ischemic event [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ].    
 

  Cerebrovascular occlusion, including fatal stroke, has occurred in 9% (40/449) of Iclusig-treated patients. Iclusig can cause stenosis over multiple segments in major arterial vessels that supply the brain (e.g., carotid, vertebral, middle cerebral artery).  



  Peripheral arterial occlusion, including fatal mesenteric artery occlusion and life-threatening peripheral arterial disease, have occurred in 12% (52/449) of Iclusig-treated patients. Patients have developed digital or distal extremity necrosis and have required amputations. Renal artery stenosis, associated with worsening, labile or treatment-resistant hypertension, has occurred in some Iclusig-treated patients [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.5)  ]  .  



  Clinicians should consider whether the benefits of Iclusig treatment are expected to exceed the risks of therapy. In patients suspected of developing arterial occlusive events, interrupt or stop Iclusig. A benefit-risk consideration should guide a decision to restart Iclusig therapy [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .  



    5.2 Venous Thromboembolism



   Venous thromboembolic events occurred in 6% (25/449) of Iclusig-treated patients, including deep venous thrombosis (10 patients), pulmonary embolism (7 patients), superficial thrombophlebitis (3 patients), and retinal vein thrombosis (2 patients) with vision loss.  



  In the phase 2 trial, the incidence of venous thromboembolism was 9% (3/32) in patients with Ph+ ALL, 10% (6/62) in patients with blast phase (BP) CML, 4% (3/85) in patients with AP-CML, and 5% (13/270) in patients with CP-CML. Consider dose modification or discontinuation of Iclusig in patients who develop serious venous thromboembolism [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .

   Fatal or serious heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction occurred in 6% of Iclusig-treated patients (N=29/449) in the phase 2 trial (48 months follow-up). Nine percent of patients (N=39) experienced any grade of heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction. The most frequently reported heart failure events were congestive cardiac failure and decreased ejection fraction (in 14 patients each; 3%).  



 Monitor patients for signs or symptoms consistent with heart failure and treat as clinically indicated, including interruption of Iclusig. Consider discontinuation of Iclusig in patients who develop serious heart failure [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .



    5.4 Hepatotoxicity



   Iclusig can cause hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death. Fulminant hepatic failure leading to death occurred in an Iclusig-treated patient within one week of starting Iclusig. Two additional fatal cases of acute liver failure also occurred. The fatal cases occurred in patients with blast phase (BP) CML or Ph+ ALL. Severe (grade 3 or 4) hepatotoxicity occurred in all disease cohorts.  



  With 48 months follow-up, 11% (50/449) of Iclusig-treated patients experienced grade 3 or 4 hepatotoxicity in the phase 2 trial. The most common forms of hepatotoxicity were elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT), bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase. The incidence of AST or ALT elevation was 54% (all grades) and 8% (grade 3 or 4). ALT or AST elevation was not reversed by the date of last follow-up in 5% of patients.  



  Hepatotoxic events were observed in 29% of patients. The median time to onset of hepatotoxicity event was 3 months, with a range of &lt;1 month to 47 months. Monitor liver function tests at baseline, then at least monthly or as clinically indicated. Interrupt, reduce or discontinue Iclusig as clinically indicated [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .  



    5.5 Hypertension



   Treatment-emergent elevation of systolic or diastolic blood pressure (BP) occurred in 68% (306/449) of patients in the phase 2 clinical trial (48 months of follow-up). Fifty three patients (12%) treated with Iclusig in this clinical trial experienced treatment-emergent symptomatic hypertension as a serious adverse reaction, including hypertensive crisis. Patients may require urgent clinical intervention for hypertension associated with confusion, headache, chest pain, or shortness of breath [see  Adverse Reactions (6)  ]  .  



  In patients with baseline systolic BP&lt;140 mm Hg and baseline diastolic BP&lt;90 mm Hg, 80% (229/285) experienced treatment-emergent hypertension; 44% (124/285) developed Stage 1 hypertension (defined as systolic BP&gt;=140 mm Hg or diastolic BP&gt;=90 mm Hg) while 37% developed Stage 2 hypertension (defined as systolic BP&gt;=160 mm Hg or diastolic BP&gt;=100 mm Hg). In 132 patients with Stage 1 hypertension at baseline, 67% (88/132) developed Stage 2 hypertension.  



 Monitor and manage blood pressure elevations during Iclusig use and treat hypertension to normalize blood pressure. Interrupt, dose reduce, or stop Iclusig if hypertension is not medically controlled. In the event of significant worsening, labile or treatment-resistant hypertension, interrupt treatment and consider evaluating for renal artery stenosis.



    5.6 Pancreatitis



   Pancreatitis occurred in 7% (31/449, 6% serious or grade 3/4) of Iclusig-treated patients with 48 months of follow-up in the phase 2 trial. The incidence of treatment-emergent lipase elevation was 42% (16% grade 3 or greater).  



  Pancreatitis resulted in discontinuation or treatment interruption in 6% of patients (26/449). The median time to onset of pancreatitis was 14 days (range: 3 - 1452). Twenty-three of the 31 cases of pancreatitis resolved within 2 weeks with dose interruption or reduction.  



 Check serum lipase every 2 weeks for the first 2 months and then monthly thereafter or as clinically indicated. Consider additional serum lipase monitoring in patients with a history of pancreatitis or alcohol abuse. Dose interruption or reduction may be required. In cases where lipase elevations are accompanied by abdominal symptoms, interrupt treatment with Iclusig and evaluate patients for pancreatitis [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ].  Do not consider restarting Iclusig until patients have complete resolution of symptoms and lipase levels are less than 1.5 * ULN.



    5.7 Increased Toxicity in Newly Diagnosed Chronic Phase CML



   In a prospective randomized clinical trial in the first line treatment of newly diagnosed patients with chronic phase (CP) CML, single agent Iclusig 45 mg once-daily increased the risk of serious adverse reactions 2-fold compared to single agent imatinib 400 mg once-daily. The median exposure to treatment was less than 6 months. The trial was halted for safety in October 2013.  



 Arterial and venous thrombosis and occlusions occurred at least twice as frequently in the Iclusig arm compared to the imatinib arm. Compared to imatinib-treated patients, Iclusig-treated patients exhibited a greater incidence of myelosuppression, pancreatitis, hepatotoxicity, cardiac failure, hypertension, and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. Iclusig is not indicated and is not recommended for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed CP-CML.



    5.8 Neuropathy



   Peripheral and cranial neuropathy have occurred in Iclusig-treated patients. Overall, 20% (90/449) of Iclusig-treated patients in the pivotal phase 2 trial experienced a peripheral neuropathy event of any grade (2%, grade 3/4) (48 months follow-up). The most common peripheral neuropathies reported were paresthesia (5%, 23/449), neuropathy peripheral (4%, 19/449), hypoesthesia (3%, 15/449), dysgeusia (2%, (10/449), muscular weakness (2% (10/449) and hyperesthesia (1%, 5/449). Cranial neuropathy developed in 2% (10/449) of Iclusig-treated patients (&lt;1%, 3/449 - grade 3/4).  



  Of the patients who developed neuropathy, 26% (23/90) developed neuropathy during the first month of treatment. Monitor patients for symptoms of neuropathy, such as hypoesthesia, hyperesthesia, paresthesia, discomfort, a burning sensation, neuropathic pain or weakness. Consider interrupting Iclusig and evaluate if neuropathy is suspected.  



    5.9 Ocular Toxicity



   Serious ocular toxicities leading to blindness or blurred vision have occurred in Iclusig-treated patients in the phase 2 trial (48 months follow-up). Retinal toxicities including macular edema, retinal vein occlusion, and retinal hemorrhage occurred in 2% of Iclusig-treated patients. Conjunctival irritation, corneal erosion or abrasion, dry eye, conjunctivitis, conjunctival hemorrhage, hyperaemia and edema or eye pain occurred in 14% of patients. Visual blurring occurred in 6% of patients. Other ocular toxicities include cataracts, periorbital edema, blepharitis, glaucoma, eyelid edema, ocular hyperaemia, iritis, iridocyclitis, and ulcerative keratitis. Conduct comprehensive eye exams at baseline and periodically during treatment [see  Adverse Reactions (6)  ]  .  



    5.10 Hemorrhage



   Serious hemorrhage events including fatalities, occurred in 6% (28/449) of patients treated with Iclusig in the phase 2 trial, with 48 months follow-up. Hemorrhage occurred in 28% (124/449) of patients. The incidence of serious bleeding events was higher in patients with AP-CML, BP-CML, and Ph+ ALL. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage and subdural hematoma were the most commonly reported serious bleeding events occurring in 1% (4/449 and 4/449, respectively). Most hemorrhagic events, but not all, occurred in patients with grade 4 thrombocytopenia [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.13)  ]  . Interrupt Iclusig for serious or severe hemorrhage and evaluate [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .  



    5.11 Fluid Retention



   Fluid retention events judged as serious occurred in 4% (18/449) of patients treated with Iclusig in the phase 2 trial (48 months follow-up). One instance of brain edema was fatal. For fluid retention events occurring in more than 2% of the patients (treatment-emergent), serious cases included: pleural effusion (7/449, 2%), pericardial effusion (4/449, 1%), and edema peripheral (2/449, &lt;1%).  



  In total, fluid retention occurred in 31% of the patients. The most common fluid retention events were peripheral edema (17%), pleural effusion (8%), pericardial effusion (4%) and peripheral swelling (3%).  



 Monitor patients for fluid retention and manage patients as clinically indicated. Interrupt, reduce, or discontinue Iclusig as clinically indicated [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ].  



    5.12 Cardiac Arrhythmias



   Arrhythmias occurred in 19% (86/449) of Iclusig-treated patients, of which 7% (33/449) were grade 3 or greater. Arrhythmia of ventricular origin was reported in 3% (3/86) of all arrhythmias, with one case being grade 3 or greater.  



  Symptomatic bradyarrhythmias that led to pacemaker implantation occurred in 1% (3/449) of Iclusig-treated patients.  



  Atrial fibrillation was the most common arrhythmia and occurred in 7% (31/449) of patients, approximately half of which were grade 3 or 4. Other grade 3 or 4 arrhythmia events included syncope (9 patients; 2.0%), tachycardia and bradycardia (2 patients each 0.4%), and electrocardiogram QT prolonged, atrial flutter , supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, atrial tachycardia, atrioventricular block complete, cardio-respiratory arrest, loss of consciousness, and sinus node dysfunction (1 patient each 0.2%). For 27 patients, the event led to hospitalization.  



  In patients with signs and symptoms suggestive of slow heart rate (fainting, dizziness) or rapid heart rate (chest pain, palpitations or dizziness), interrupt Iclusig and evaluate.  



    5.13 Myelosuppression



   Myelosuppression was reported as an adverse reaction in 59% (266/449) of patients, and severe (grade 3 or 4) myelosuppression occurred in 50% (226/449) of patients treated with Iclusig. With 48 months of follow-up, the incidence of these events was greater in patients with AP-CML, BP-CML, and Ph+ ALL than in patients with CP-CML.  



  Severe myelosuppression (Grade 3 or 4) was observed early in treatment, with a median onset time of 1 month (range &lt;1- 40 months). Obtain complete blood counts every 2 weeks for the first 3 months and then monthly or as clinically indicated, and adjust the dose as recommended [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  .  



    5.14 Tumor Lysis Syndrome



   Two patients (&lt;1%) treated with Iclusig developed serious tumor lysis syndrome. One case occurred in a patient with advanced AP-CML and one case occurred in a patient with BP-CML. Hyperuricemia occurred in 7% (31/449) of patients. Due to the potential for tumor lysis syndrome in patients with advanced disease (AP-CML, BP-CML, or Ph+ ALL), ensure adequate hydration and treat high uric acid levels prior to initiating therapy with Iclusig.  



    5.15 Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS)



   Post marketing cases of reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS - also known as Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome - PRES) have been reported in Iclusig-treated patients. RPLS is a neurological disorder that can present with signs and symptoms such as seizure, headache, decreased alertness, altered mental functioning, vision loss, and other visual and neurological disturbances. Hypertension is often present and diagnosis is made with supportive findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. If RPLS is diagnosed, interrupt Iclusig treatment and resume treatment only once the event is resolved and if the benefit of continued treatment outweighs the risk of RPLS.  



    5.16 Compromised Wound Healing and Gastrointestinal Perforation



   No formal studies of the effect of Iclusig on wound healing have been conducted. Based on the mechanism of action [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)  ]  , Iclusig could compromise wound healing. Serious gastrointestinal perforation (fistula) occurred in one patient 38 days post-cholecystectomy.  



 Interrupt Iclusig for at least 1 week prior to major surgery. The decision when to resume Iclusig after surgery should be based on clinical judgment of adequate wound healing.



    5.17 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



   Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies, Iclusig can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of ponatinib to pregnant rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental effects at exposures lower than human exposures at the recommended human dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Iclusig and for 3 weeks after the last dose [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1  ,  8.3)  and   Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)    ]  .
