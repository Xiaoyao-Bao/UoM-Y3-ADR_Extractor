  The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling:



 *    Severe Allergic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]  
 *    Eye Irritation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]  
 *    Local Irritation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]  
 *     Clostridium difficile- Associated Diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]  
   *    The most frequent adverse reactions (at least 1%) were burning, stinging or pain, and itching. (6.1) 
      EXCERPT:     To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact GlaxoSmithKline at 1-888-825-5249 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or    www.fda.gov/medwatch.  
 

 

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The following local adverse reactions were reported by at least 1% of subjects in connection with the use of BACTROBAN ointment in clinical trials: burning, stinging, or pain in 1.5% of subjects; itching in 1% of subjects. Rash, nausea, erythema, dry skin, tenderness, swelling, contact dermatitis, and increased exudate were reported in less than 1% of subjects.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of BACTROBAN ointment. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal relationship to BACTROBAN ointment.



   Immune System Disorders  



 Systemic allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, urticaria, angioedema, and generalized rash  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]  .

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *    Severe Allergic Reactions: Anaphylaxis, urticaria, angioedema, and generalized rash, have been reported in patients treated with formulations of BACTROBAN, including BACTROBAN ointment. (  5.1)   
 *    Eye Irritation: Avoid contact with eyes. (  5.2  ) 
 *    Local Irritation: Discontinue in the event of sensitization or severe local irritation. (  5.3  ) 
 *     Clostridium difficile- Associated Diarrhea (CDAD): If diarrhea occurs, evaluate patients for CDAD. (  5.4  ) 
 *    Potential for Microbial Overgrowth: Prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible microorganisms, including fungi. (  5.5  ) 
 *    Risk Associated with Mucosal Use: BACTROBAN ointment is not formulated for use on mucosal surfaces. A separate formulation, BACTROBAN nasal ointment, is available for intranasal use. (  5.6  ) 
 *    Risk of Polyethylene Glycol Absorption: BACTROBAN ointment should not be used where absorption of large quantities of polyethylene glycol is possible, especially if there is evidence of moderate or severe renal impairment. (  5.7  ) 
 *    Risk Associated with Use at Intravenous Sites: BACTROBAN ointment should not be used with intravenous cannulae or at central intravenous sites because of the potential to promote fungal infections and antimicrobial resistance. (  5.8  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Severe Allergic Reactions



  Systemic allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, urticaria, angioedema, and generalized rash have been reported in patients treated with formulations of BACTROBAN, including BACTROBAN ointment [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]  .



    5.2 Eye Irritation



  Avoid contact with the eyes. In case of accidental contact, rinse well with water.



    5.3 Local Irritation



  In the event of a sensitization or severe local irritation from BACTROBAN ointment, usage should be discontinued, and appropriate alternative therapy for the infection instituted.



    5.4 Clostridium difficile-  Associated Diarrhea



   Clostridium difficile  -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile  .



  C. difficile  produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile  cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents.



 If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile  may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile  , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.



    5.5 Potential for Microbial Overgrowth



  As with other antibacterial products, prolonged use of BACTROBAN ointment may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible microorganisms, including fungi [see Dosage and Administration (2)]  .



    5.6 Risk Associated with Mucosal Use



  BACTROBAN ointment is not formulated for use on mucosal surfaces. Intranasal use has been associated with isolated reports of stinging and drying. A separate formulation, BACTROBAN  (r)  (mupirocin calcium) nasal ointment, is available for intranasal use.



    5.7 Risk of Polyethylene Glycol Absorption



  Polyethylene glycol can be absorbed from open wounds and damaged skin and is excreted by the kidneys. In common with other polyethylene glycol-based ointments, BACTROBAN ointment should not be used in conditions where absorption of large quantities of polyethylene glycol is possible, especially if there is evidence of moderate or severe renal impairment.



    5.8 Risk Associated with Use at Intravenous Sites



  BACTROBAN ointment should not be used with intravenous cannulae or at central intravenous sites because of the potential to promote fungal infections and antimicrobial resistance.
