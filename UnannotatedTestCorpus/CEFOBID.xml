  Clinical Trials Experience

  In clinical studies the following adverse effects were observed and were considered to be related to CEFOBID therapy or of uncertain etiology:



   Hypersensitivity

  As with all cephalosporins, hypersensitivity manifested by skin reactions (1 patient in 45), drug fever (1 in 260), or a change in Coombs' test (1 in 60) has been reported. These reactions are more likely to occur in patients with a history of allergies, particularly to penicillin.



   Hematology

  As with other beta-lactam antibacterial drugs, reversible neutropenia may occur with prolonged administration. Slight decreases in neutrophil count (1 patient in 50) have been reported. Decreased hemoglobins (1 in 20) or hematocrits (1 in 20) have been reported, which is consistent with published literature on other cephalosporins. Transient eosinophilia has occurred in 1 patient in 10.



   Hepatic

  Of 1285 patients treated with cefoperazone in clinical trials, one patient with a history of liver disease developed significantly elevated liver function enzymes during CEFOBID therapy. Clinical signs and symptoms of nonspecific hepatitis accompanied these increases. After CEFOBID therapy was discontinued, the patient's enzymes returned to pre-treatment levels and the symptomatology resolved. As with other antibacterial drugs that achieve high bile levels, mild transient elevations of liver function enzymes have been observed in 5-10% of the patients receiving CEFOBID therapy. The relevance of these findings, which were not accompanied by overt signs or symptoms of hepatic dysfunction, has not been established.



   Gastrointestinal

  Diarrhea or loose stools has been reported in 1 in 30 patients. Most of these experiences have been mild or moderate in severity and self-limiting in nature. In all cases, these symptoms responded to symptomatic therapy or ceased when cefoperazone therapy was stopped. Nausea and vomiting have been reported rarely.



 Symptoms of pseudomembranous colitis can appear during or for several weeks subsequent to antibacterial therapy (see  WARNINGS  ).



   Renal Function Tests

  Transient elevations of the BUN (1 in 16) and serum creatinine (1 in 48) have been noted.



   Local Reactions

  CEFOBID is well tolerated following intramuscular administration. Occasionally, transient pain (1 in 140) may follow administration by this route. When CEFOBID is administered by intravenous infusion some patients may develop phlebitis (1 in 120) at the infusion site.



   Post-Marketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of CEFOBID. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: Coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, hypoprothrombinaemia (See  PRECAUTIONS  )



 Immune System disorders: Anaphylactic reaction including shock and fatal cases (See  WARNINGS  )



 Hepatobiliary Disorders: Jaundice, hepatic dysfunction



 Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens Johnson syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis, pruritus



 Vascular Disorders: Hemorrhage (See  WARNINGS  )

   General



  Prescribing CEFOBID in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.



 Although transient elevations of the BUN and serum creatinine have been observed, CEFOBID alone does not appear to cause significant nephrotoxicity. However, concomitant administration of aminoglycosides and other cephalosporins has caused nephrotoxicity.



 CEFOBID is extensively excreted in bile. The serum half-life of CEFOBID is increased 2-4 fold in patients with hepatic disease and/or biliary obstruction. In general, total daily dosage above 4 g should not be necessary in such patients. If higher dosages are used, serum concentrations should be monitored.



 Because renal excretion is not the main route of elimination of CEFOBID (see  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  ), patients with renal failure require no adjustment in dosage when usual doses are administered. When high doses of CEFOBID are used, concentrations of drug in the serum should be monitored periodically. If evidence of accumulation exists, dosage should be decreased accordingly.



 The half-life of CEFOBID is reduced slightly during hemodialysis. Thus, dosing should be scheduled to follow a dialysis period. In patients with both hepatic dysfunction and significant renal disease, CEFOBID dosage should not exceed 1-2 g daily without close monitoring of serum concentrations.



 As with other antibacterial drugs, vitamin K deficiency resulting in coagulopathy has occurred in patients treated with CEFOBID. The mechanism is probably related to the suppression of gut flora which normally synthesize this vitamin. Those at risk include patients with a poor nutritional status, malabsorption states (e.g., cystic fibrosis), alcoholism, and patients on prolonged hyper-alimentation regimens (administered either intravenously or via a naso-gastric tube). Hypoprothrombinemia with or without bleeding has been reported. Prothrombin time should be monitored in these patients and exogenous vitamin K administered as indicated.



 A disulfiram-like reaction characterized by flushing, sweating, headache, and tachycardia has been reported when alcohol (beer, wine) was ingested within 72 hours after CEFOBID administration. Patients should be cautioned about the ingestion of alcoholic beverages following the administration of CEFOBID.



 Prolonged use of CEFOBID may result in the overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Careful observation of the patient is essential. If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken.



 CEFOBID should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis.



    Information for Patients



  Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including CEFOBID should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When CEFOBID is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treated by CEFOBID or other antibacterial drugs in the future.



 Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs which usually ends when the drug is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterial drugs, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial drug. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.



    Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions



  A false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine may occur with Benedict's or Fehling's solution.



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility



  Long term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential. The maximum duration of CEFOBID animal toxicity studies is six months. In none of the in vivo  or in vitro  genetic toxicology studies did CEFOBID show any mutagenic potential at either the chromosomal or subchromosomal level. CEFOBID produced no impairment of fertility and had no effects on general reproductive performance or fetal development when administered subcutaneously at daily doses up to 500 to 1000 mg/kg prior to and during mating, and to pregnant female rats during gestation. These doses are 10 to 20 times the estimated usual single clinical dose. CEFOBID had adverse effects on the testes of prepubertal rats at all doses tested. Subcutaneous administration of 1000 mg/kg per day (approximately 16 times the average adult human dose) resulted in reduced testicular weight, arrested spermatogenesis, reduced germinal cell population and vacuolation of Sertoli cell cytoplasm. The severity of lesions was dose dependent in the 100 to 1000 mg/kg per day range; the low dose caused a minor decrease in spermatocytes. This effect has not been observed in adult rats. Histologically the lesions were reversible at all but the highest dosage levels. However, these studies did not evaluate subsequent development of reproductive function in the rats. The relationship of these findings to humans is unknown.



    Usage in Pregnancy



  Reproduction studies have been performed in mice, rats, and monkeys at doses up to 10 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to CEFOBID. There are, however, no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.



    Usage in Nursing Mothers



  Only low concentrations of CEFOBID are excreted in human milk. Although CEFOBID passes poorly into breast milk of nursing mothers, caution should be exercised when CEFOBID is administered to a nursing woman.



    Pediatric Use



  Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established. For information concerning testicular changes in prepubertal rats (see   Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility    ).



    Geriatric Use



  Clinical studies of CEFOBID  (r)  (sterile cefoperazone sodium) did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

   Hypersensitivity Reactions



  SERIOUS AND OCCASIONALLY FATAL HYPERSENSITIVITY (ANAPHYLACTIC) REACTIONS HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN PATIENTS RECEIVING BETA-LACTAM ANTIBACTERIALS, INCLUDING CEFOPERAZONE. THESE REACTIONS ARE MORE APT TO OCCUR IN INDIVIDUALS WITH A HISTORY OF HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS TO MULTIPLE ALLERGENS. BEFORE THERAPY WITH CEFOBID IS INSTITUTED, CAREFUL INQUIRY SHOULD BE MADE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE PATIENT HAS HAD PREVIOUS HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS TO CEPHALOSPORINS, PENICILLINS, CARBAPENEMS OR OTHER DRUGS. THIS PRODUCT SHOULD BE GIVEN CAUTIOUSLY TO BETA-LACTAM ALLERGIC PATIENTS. IF AN ALLERGIC REACTION OCCURS, CEFOPERAZONE SHOULD BE DISCONTINUED AND APPROPRIATE THERAPY INSTITUTED.



 Severe and occasionally fatal skin reactions such as toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and exfoliative dermatitis have been reported in patients on CEFOBID therapy. If a severe skin reaction occurs CEFOBID should be discontinued and appropriate therapy should be initiated [see  ADVERSE REACTIONS  ].



     Clostridium difficile  -Associated Diarrhea



   Clostridium difficile  associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including CEFOBID, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile  .



  C. difficile  produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile  cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antibacterial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.



 If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile  may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile  , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.



    Hemorrhage



  Serious hemorrhage cases, including fatalities, have been reported with cefoperazone. Monitor for signs of bleeding, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy. Discontinue CEFOBID if there is persistent bleeding and no alternative explanations are identified.
