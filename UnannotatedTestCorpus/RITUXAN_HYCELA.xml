  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 The data described below reflect exposure to RITUXAN HYCELA in 892 patients in four controlled trials with exposures ranging from a single injection up to 27 months of treatment.



 The population included 382 patients with follicular lymphoma (FL), 369 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and 141 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The population was aged 18-85 years (with a median age of 60 years), 53% male and 47% female. Most of the patients were Caucasians (84%). In the SABRINA study patients with FL received a full dose of a rituximab product by intravenous infusion, followed by RITUXAN HYCELA (1,400 mg rituximab/23,400 Units hyaluronidase human), in combination with chemotherapy for up to 7 doses (i.e., total of 8 doses in combination with chemotherapy), or as monotherapy for up to 12 doses (maintenance treatment). In the MabEase study patients with DLBCL received a full dose of a rituximab product by intravenous infusion, followed by RITUXAN HYCELA (1,400 mg rituximab/23,400 Units hyaluronidase human), given in combination with chemotherapy for up to 7 doses (i.e., up to a total of 8 doses). In the SAWYER study patients with CLL on part 2 received a full dose of a rituximab product by intravenous infusion, followed by RITUXAN HYCELA (1,600 mg rituximab/26,800 Units hyaluronidase human) for up to 5 doses, in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (i.e., total of 6 doses).



 The most common adverse reactions (&gt;= 20%) of RITUXAN HYCELA observed in patients with FL on the SABRINA study were: infections, neutropenia, nausea, constipation, cough, and fatigue.



 The most common adverse reactions (&gt;= 20%) of RITUXAN HYCELA observed in patients with DLBCL on the MabEase study were: infections, neutropenia, alopecia, nausea, and anemia.



 The most common adverse reactions (&gt;= 20%) of RITUXAN HYCELA observed in patients with CLL on part 2 of the SAWYER study were: infections, neutropenia, nausea, thrombocytopenia, pyrexia, vomiting, and injection site erythema.



     Administration-related reactions (ARRs)  



 Administration-related reactions (ARRs) with RITUXAN HYCELA were defined as all the adverse reactions related to the administration of RITUXAN HYCELA within the 24 hours post injection.



 The incidence of ARRs with RITUXAN HYCELA was 34% in FL/DLBCL in combination with chemotherapy with injection site erythema (5%), chills (3%), dyspnea, erythema, flushing, injection site pain, nausea, pruritus, pyrexia, rash, and throat irritation (2% each) being the most common ARRs. The incidence of ARRs in FL maintenance setting was 20%. The most common ARRs were injection site erythema (7%), erythema (4%), injection site pain/edema, myalgia, and rash (2% each).



 The incidence of ARRs with RITUXAN HYCELA in CLL was 44%.



 With the exception of Local Cutaneous Reactions, the incidence and profile of adverse reactions reported for RITUXAN HYCELA were comparable with those for rituximab. The overall incidence of adverse reactions for intravenous rituximab versus RITUXAN HYCELA in combination with chemotherapy for FL/DLBCL was 93% versus 95% (BSA &lt;= 1.73 m  2  ), 89% versus 93% (1.73 &lt; BSA &lt;= 1.92 m  2  ), and 94% versus 94% (BSA &gt; 1.92 m  2  ). The overall incidence of adverse reactions for rituximab versus RITUXAN HYCELA in CLL was 89% versus 100% (BSA &lt;= 1.81 m  2  ), 97% versus 88% (1.82 &lt; BSA &lt;= 1.99 m  2  ), and 88% versus 93% (BSA &gt; 2.00 m  2  ).



     Summary of Clinical Trial Experience in Follicular Lymphoma (FL)  



 The data in  Table 1  were obtained in the SABRINA study, a two-stage randomized, controlled study in patients with previously untreated FL. The study compared patients receiving RITUXAN HYCELA (1,400 mg rituximab/23,400 Units hyaluronidase human; n=197) with patients receiving a rituximab product by intravenous infusion (375 mg/m  2  ; n=210), both in combination with CHOP or CVP followed by maintenance treatment with RITUXAN HYCELA or a rituximab product by intravenous infusion.



 The majority of patients completed all 8 cycles of combination treatment with chemotherapy (91% RITUXAN HYCELA vs. 90% rituximab). In addition, 69% of patients in each of the treatment groups completed all 20 cycles of combination plus maintenance treatment. In both RITUXAN HYCELA and rituximab groups, patients experienced similar median duration of exposure (27.1 months for each arm).



 Across the two stages, the overall demographics and baseline characteristics were balanced between the treatment groups. However, there were more female patients (53%) randomized in the study than male patients (47%) and a higher proportion of females were randomized to receive RITUXAN HYCELA (59% female) compared with the rituximab group (48%). The treatment groups in the combined Stage 1 and 2 population were otherwise balanced in regard to baseline demographics, characterized by a median age of 57 years (56.0 years [range 28-85 years] for RITUXAN HYCELA and 57 years [range 28-86 years] for rituximab) and median BSA of 1.83 m  2  (1.80 and 1.84 m  2  for RITUXAN HYCELA and rituximab, respectively).



 The incidence of all adverse reactions was 96% for RITUXAN HYCELA vs. 95% for rituximab (  Table 1  ). Grade 3-4 adverse reactions were reported in 55% of patients receiving RITUXAN HYCELA vs. 53% in patients receiving rituximab. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 37% of patients receiving RITUXAN HYCELA vs. 34% of patients receiving rituximab. The most common adverse reactions (occurring in &gt;= 20% of patients in any arm) were infections, neutropenia, nausea, constipation, cough, and fatigue.



 A total of 36 patients died, including 14/197 patients (7%) who received RITUXAN HYCELA and 22/210 patients (10%) who received rituximab. Of these 36 patients, 19 patients (7 patients RITUXAN HYCELA [4%] vs. 12 patients rituximab [6%]) died due to adverse reactions and 13 patients (6 patients RITUXAN HYCELA [3%] vs. 7 patients rituximab [3%]) died due to disease progression.



 The incidence of administration-related reactions (ARRs) due to the subcutaneous route of administration associated with RITUXAN HYCELA was assessed in combination with chemotherapy and during maintenance. Thirty patients (15%) experienced an ARR during the first administration of RITUXAN HYCELA (Cycle 2). Incidence of ARRs generally decreased at subsequent cycles with 18 patients (9%) reporting ARR at Cycle 3, 13 patients (7%) at Cycle 4, 11 patients (6%) at Cycles 5 and 6, 12 patients (7%) at Cycle 7, and 8 patients (4%) at Cycle 8. During RITUXAN HYCELA monotherapy in the maintenance setting the incidence of ARRs at each cycle was &lt;= 7% and was observed in 24 patients (14%) overall. Grade 1-2 ARRs constituted 96% of the overall ARRs. Grade 3 ARRs were reported during the first administration of RITUXAN HYCELA at Cycle 2 by 2 patients. Of the reported ARRs, local cutaneous reactions with RITUXAN HYCELA were reported in 32 patients. These events resolved within a median of 2 days from the onset (range 1 to 37 days). Majority of these reactions were Grade 1 and 2 and were observed in 31 patients (16%).

               Summary of Clinical Trial Experience in Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)  
 

 The data in  Table 2  were obtained in the MabEASE study, a comparative, randomized, parallel-group, multicenter study to investigate the efficacy of RITUXAN HYCELA (1,400 mg rituximab and 23,400 Units hyaluronidase human; n=369) versus 375 mg/m  2  a rituximab product by intravenous infusion (n=203) both in combination with CHOP (R-CHOP) in previously untreated patients with CD20-positive DLBCL.



 Eighty two percent of patients receiving RITUXAN HYCELA or rituximab completed all 8 cycles of study treatment. In both RITUXAN HYCELA and rituximab treatment groups, patients experienced 4.9 months median duration of rituximab exposure in each arm.



 The demographic characteristics were balanced between the two treatment groups. Most patients were Caucasian (79%) and more than half (54%) were male. The study population had a median age of 64 years (61% of patients aged &gt;= 60 years) with median BSA of 1.83 m  2  (1.83 and 1.84 m  2  for RITUXAN HYCELA and rituximab groups, respectively).



 The incidences of adverse reactions of any grade (RITUXAN HYCELA [94%] vs. rituximab [92%]) (  Table 2  ), Grade 3-4 adverse reactions (RITUXAN HYCELA [63%] vs. rituximab [57%]), and serious adverse reactions (RITUXAN HYCELA [42%] vs. rituximab [37%]) were generally comparable between the two treatment groups. The common adverse reactions (occurring in &gt;= 20% of patients in any treatment group) were neutropenia, alopecia, nausea, and anemia.



 A total of 91 patients (16%) died, including 58/369 patients (16%) in RITUXAN HYCELA and 33/203 patients (16%) in rituximab. Of these patients, 44 patients (29 patients RITUXAN HYCELA [8%] vs. 15 patients rituximab [7%]) died due to adverse reactions and 35 patients (22 patients RITUXAN HYCELA [6%] vs. 13 patients rituximab [6%]) died due to disease progression. Pneumonia (4 patients RITUXAN HYCELA vs. 1 patient rituximab), septic shock (2 patients RITUXAN HYCELA vs. 3 patients rituximab), and cardiac arrest (1 patient RITUXAN HYCELA vs. 3 patients rituximab) were the most common adverse reactions leading to death.



 The incidence of administration-related reactions was balanced between the RITUXAN HYCELA and rituximab groups (28% vs. 29%). Grade 1-2 ARRs constituted 97% of the overall ARRs for the RITUXAN HYCELA arm and 80% for the rituximab arm. Of the reported ARRs, local cutaneous reactions with RITUXAN HYCELA were reported in 17 patients. These events resolved within a median of 2 days from the onset (range 1 to 32 days). Majority of these reactions were Grade 1 and 2 and were observed in 16 patients (4%).

               Summary of Clinical Trial Experience in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia  
 

 The data in  Table 3  were obtained in part 2 of the SAWYER study, a two-part, comparative, randomized, parallel-group, multicenter study of RITUXAN HYCELA versus a rituximab product by intravenous infusion both in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC) chemotherapy in patients with previously untreated CLL.



 The safety analysis population in part 2 of the study included 85 patients receiving RITUXAN HYCELA (1,600 mg rituximab/26,800 Units hyaluronidase human) and 89 patients receiving 500 mg/m  2  rituximab. In both RITUXAN HYCELA and rituximab groups, patients had similar median duration of rituximab exposure (4.9 vs. 4.7 months). The majority of patients received all 6 cycles of study treatment (86% RITUXAN HYCELA vs. 81% rituximab).



 The patient population was predominantly Caucasian (96%), male (65%), with a median age of 60 years and median BSA of 1.9 m  2  (1.97 and 1.86 m  2  for the RITUXAN HYCELA and intravenous rituximab groups, respectively). Overall, the treatment groups were balanced with respect to demographic characteristics, with the exception of more males in the RITUXAN HYCELA arm (71% RITUXAN HYCELA vs. 60% rituximab). Baseline disease characteristics were similar between the two groups. Over half of the patients (62%) had Binet Stage B disease and the majority had typical CLL characterizations (93%), with median time from first CLL diagnosis to randomization being 18.5 months.



 The incidences of adverse reactions were balanced between the two treatment groups (96% RITUXAN HYCELA vs. 91% rituximab), and the common adverse reactions (occurring in &gt;= 20% of patients in any arm) were infections, neutropenia, nausea, thrombocytopenia, pyrexia, anemia, vomiting, and injection site erythema. The incidences of Grade 3-4 adverse reactions were also balanced between the two treatment groups (69% RITUXAN HYCELA vs. 71% rituximab). The incidence of serious adverse reactions was 29% for RITUXAN HYCELA and 33% for rituximab. The incidence of administration-related reactions was 44% for RITUXAN HYCELA and 45% for rituximab). Of the reported ARRs, local cutaneous reactions with RITUXAN HYCELA were reported in 15 patients. These events resolved within a median of 6 days from the onset (range 3 to 29 days). Majority of these reactions were Grade 1 and 2 and were observed in 14 patients (16%).



 A total of 9 patients (5%) died, including 5 patients in the RITUXAN HYCELA group and 4 patients in the rituximab group. In the RITUXAN HYCELA group, 1 patient died due to herpes zoster infection, 1 patient died as a result of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) (considered by the investigator as related to rituximab), and 3 patients died due to disease progression. In the rituximab group, 2 patients died due to diarrhea and listeriosis and 2 patients died due to disease progression.

             6.2 Immunogenicity
   As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to RITUXAN HYCELA and rituximab in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading.



 In the SABRINA study, where previously untreated patients with follicular lymphoma were treated with RITUXAN HYCELA or rituximab in combination with CVP or CHOP, the incidence of treatment-induced/enhanced anti-rituximab antibodies in the RITUXAN HYCELA group was similar to that observed in the rituximab group (2.0% RITUXAN HYCELA vs. 1.5% rituximab). The incidence of treatment-induced/enhanced anti-recombinant human hyaluronidase antibodies was 13% in the RITUXAN HYCELA group compared with 8% in the rituximab group, and the overall proportion of patients found to have anti-recombinant human hyaluronidase antibodies remained generally constant over the follow-up period in both cohorts. All patients who tested positive for anti-recombinant human hyaluronidase antibodies at any point during the study were negative for neutralizing antibodies.



 In the SAWYER study, where previously untreated patients with CLL were treated with RITUXAN HYCELA or rituximab in combination with FC, the incidence of treatment-induced/enhanced anti-rituximab antibodies was 2.4% in the RITUXAN HYCELA group vs. 6.7% in rituximab group. The incidence of treatment-induced/enhanced anti-recombinant human hyaluronidase antibodies was 10.6% in the RITUXAN HYCELA treatment arm. None of the patients who tested positive for anti-recombinant human hyaluronidase antibodies tested positive for neutralizing antibodies.



 The clinical relevance of the development of anti-rituximab or anti-recombinant human hyaluronidase antibodies after treatment with RITUXAN HYCELA is not known.



   6.3 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of rituximab-containing products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

   5.1 Severe Mucocutaneous Reactions



  Mucocutaneous reactions, some with fatal outcome, can occur in patients treated with rituximab-containing products, including RITUXAN HYCELA. These reactions include paraneoplastic pemphigus, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, lichenoid dermatitis, vesiculobullous dermatitis, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Discontinue RITUXAN HYCELA in patients who experience a severe mucocutaneous reaction. The safety of re-administration of a rituximab-containing product, including RITUXAN HYCELA, to patients with severe mucocutaneous reactions has not been determined .  



    5.2 Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation



  Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure and death, can occur in patients treated with drugs classified as CD20-directed cytolytic antibodies, including rituximab-containing products. HBV reactivation is defined as an abrupt increase in HBV replication manifesting as a rapid increase in serum HBV DNA levels or detection of HBsAg in a person who was previously HBsAg negative and anti-HBc positive. Reactivation of HBV replication is often followed by hepatitis, i.e., increase in transaminase levels. In severe cases increase in bilirubin levels, liver failure, and death can occur.



 Screen all patients for HBV infection by measuring HBsAg and anti-HBc before initiating treatment with a rituximab-containing product. For patients who show evidence of prior hepatitis B infection (HBsAg positive [regardless of antibody status] or HBsAg negative but anti-HBc positive), consult with physicians with expertise in managing hepatitis B regarding monitoring and consideration for HBV antiviral therapy before and/or during treatment with a rituximab-containing product. Monitor patients with evidence of current or prior HBV infection for clinical and laboratory signs of hepatitis or HBV reactivation during and for several months following RITUXAN HYCELA. HBV reactivation has been reported up to 24 months following completion of therapy containing rituximab.



 In patients who develop reactivation of HBV while on RITUXAN HYCELA, immediately discontinue treatment and any concomitant chemotherapy, and institute appropriate treatment. Insufficient data exist regarding the safety of resuming RITUXAN HYCELA treatment in patients who develop HBV reactivation. Resumption of RITUXAN HYCELA treatment in patients whose HBV reactivation resolves should be discussed with physicians with expertise in managing HBV.



    5.3 Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)



  JC virus infection resulting in PML and death has been observed in patients receiving rituximab-containing products, including RITUXAN HYCELA. Consider the diagnosis of PML in any patient presenting with new-onset neurologic manifestations. Evaluation of PML includes, but is not limited to, consultation with a neurologist, brain MRI, and lumbar puncture.



 Discontinue RITUXAN HYCELA and consider discontinuation or reduction of any concomitant chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy in patients who develop PML [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



    5.4 Hypersensitivity and other Administration Reactions



   Systemic Reactions  



 Patients must receive at least one full dose of a rituximab product by intravenous infusion before receiving RITUXAN HYCELA due to the higher risk of hypersensitivity and other acute reactions during the first infusion [see  Dosage and Administration (2.1)  ].  Beginning therapy with a rituximab product by intravenous infusion allows management of hypersensitivity and other administration reactions by slowing or stopping the intravenous infusion.



 Rituximab-containing products, including RITUXAN HYCELA, are associated with hypersensitivity and other administration reactions, which may be related to release of cytokines and/or other chemical mediators. Cytokine release syndrome may be clinically indistinguishable from acute hypersensitivity reactions.



 This set of reactions which includes syndrome of cytokine release, tumor lysis syndrome and anaphylactic and hypersensitivity reactions are described below. They are not specifically related to the route of administration of a rituximab-containing product.



 Severe infusion-related reactions with fatal outcome have been reported with the use of intravenous formulations of rituximab products, with an onset ranging within 30 minutes to 2 hours after starting the first intravenous infusion. They were characterized by pulmonary events in addition to fever, chills, rigors, hypotension, urticaria, angioedema and other symptoms.



 Anaphylactic and other hypersensitivity reactions can also occur. In contrast to cytokine release syndrome, true hypersensitivity reactions typically occur within minutes after starting infusion.



 Severe cytokine release syndrome is characterized by severe dyspnea, often associated by bronchospasm and hypoxia, in addition to fever, chills, rigors, urticaria, and angioedema. This syndrome may be associated with acute respiratory failure and death [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.5)  ]  . Cytokine release syndrome may occur within 1-2 hours of initiating the infusion. Patients with a history of pulmonary insufficiency or those with pulmonary tumor infiltration may be at a greater risk of poor outcome. Rituximab product administration should be interrupted immediately and aggressive symptomatic treatment initiated.



 During RITUXAN HYCELA administration, the injection should be interrupted immediately when observing signs of a severe reaction and aggressive symptomatic treatment should be initiated.



 Closely monitor the following patients: those with pre-existing cardiac or pulmonary conditions, those who experienced prior cardiopulmonary adverse reactions, and those with high numbers of circulating malignant cells (&gt;= 25,000/mm  3  ) [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.5  ,  5.7)  ].  



 Premedicate patients with an antihistamine and acetaminophen prior to each administration of RITUXAN HYCELA [see  Dosage and Administration (2.5)  ].  Premedication with glucocorticoids should also be considered. Observe patients for at least 15 minutes following RITUXAN HYCELA. A longer period may be appropriate in patients with an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions.



    Local Cutaneous Reactions  



 Local cutaneous reactions, including injection site reactions, have been reported in patients receiving RITUXAN HYCELA. Symptoms included pain, swelling, induration, hemorrhage, erythema, pruritus, and rash [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Some local cutaneous reactions occurred more than 24 hours after RITUXAN HYCELA administration. The incidence of local cutaneous reactions following administration of RITUXAN HYCELA was 16%. Reactions were mild or moderate and resolved without any specific treatment. Local cutaneous reactions of any Grade were most common during the first RITUXAN HYCELA cycle (Cycle 2; 5%) with the incidence decreasing with subsequent injections.



    5.5 Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS)



  TLS can occur within 12-24 hours after administration of a rituximab-containing product, including RITUXAN HYCELA. A high number of circulating malignant cells (&gt;= 25,000/mm  3  ) or high tumor burden confers a greater risk of TLS. Administer aggressive intravenous hydration and anti-hyperuricemic therapy in patients at high risk for TLS. Correct electrolyte abnormalities, monitor renal function and fluid balance, and administer supportive care, including dialysis as indicated [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.8)  ]  .



    5.6 Infections



  Serious, including fatal, bacterial, fungal, and new or reactivated viral infections can occur during and following the completion of therapy with rituximab-containing products, including RITUXAN HYCELA. The incidence of infections with RITUXAN HYCELA vs rituximab was 56% and 49% respectively in patients with CLL, and 46% and 41% respectively in patients with FL/DLBCL in combination with chemotherapy. Infections have been reported in some patients with prolonged hypogammaglobulinemia (defined as hypogammaglobulinemia &gt; 11 months after rituximab exposure). New or reactivated viral infections included cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, parvovirus B19, varicella zoster virus, West Nile virus, and hepatitis B and C. Discontinue RITUXAN HYCELA for serious infections and institute appropriate anti-infective therapy [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



    5.7 Cardiovascular Adverse Reactions



  Cardiac adverse reactions, including ventricular fibrillation, myocardial infarction, and cardiogenic shock may occur with rituximab-containing products, including RITUXAN HYCELA .  



 Discontinue RITUXAN HYCELA for serious or life threatening cardiac arrhythmias. Perform cardiac monitoring during and after all administrations of RITUXAN HYCELA for patients who develop clinically significant arrhythmias, or who have a history of arrhythmia or angina [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



    5.8 Renal Toxicity



  Severe, including fatal, renal toxicity can occur after administration of rituximab-containing products, including RITUXAN HYCELA .  Renal toxicity has occurred in patients who experience tumor lysis syndrome and in patients with administered concomitant cisplatin therapy during clinical trials. The combination of cisplatin and RITUXAN HYCELA is not an approved treatment regimen. Monitor closely for signs of renal failure and discontinue RITUXAN HYCELA in patients with a rising serum creatinine or oliguria [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.5)  ]  .



    5.9 Bowel Obstruction and Perforation



  Abdominal pain, bowel obstruction and perforation, in some cases leading to death, can occur in patients receiving rituximab-containing products, including RITUXAN HYCELA ,  in combination with chemotherapy. In postmarketing reports, the mean time to documented gastrointestinal perforation was 6 (range 1-77) days. Evaluate if symptoms of obstruction such as abdominal pain or repeated vomiting occur.



    5.10 Immunization



  The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines following rituximab-containing products, including RITUXAN HYCELA ,  therapy has not been studied and vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended before or during treatment.



    5.11 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  Based on human data, rituximab-containing products can cause fetal harm due to B-cell lymphocytopenia in infants exposed to rituximab in-utero. Advise pregnant women of the risk to a fetus. Females of childbearing potential should use effective contraception while receiving RITUXAN HYCELA and for 12 months following the last dose of rituximab-containing products, including RITUXAN HYCELA.
