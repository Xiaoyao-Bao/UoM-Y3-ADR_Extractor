  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



   Acute Myeloid Leukemia  



 The safety evaluation of RYDAPT (50 mg twice daily with food) in patients with newly diagnosed FLT3 mutated AML is based on a randomized, double-blind, trial of RYDAPT (n = 345) or placebo (n = 335) with chemotherapy  [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].  The overall median duration of exposure was 42 days (range 2 to 576 days) for patients in the RYDAPT plus chemotherapy arm versus 34 days (range 1 to 465 days) for patients in the placebo plus chemotherapy arm. On the RYDAPT plus chemotherapy arm, 35% of patients completed induction and consolidation therapy, compared to 25% of patients on the placebo plus chemotherapy arm.



 The most frequent (incidence greater than or equal to 20%) adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in the RYDAPT plus chemotherapy arm were febrile neutropenia, nausea, mucositis, vomiting, headache, petechiae, musculoskeletal pain, epistaxis, device-related infection, hyperglycemia, and upper respiratory tract infections. The most frequent Grade 3/4 adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 10%) were febrile neutropenia, device-related infection and mucositis.



 The most frequent serious adverse reaction (&gt;= 10%) in patients in the RYDAPT plus chemotherapy arm was febrile neutropenia (16%), which occurred at a similar rate in the placebo arm (16%).



 Discontinuation due to any adverse reaction occurred in 9% of patients in the RYDAPT arm versus 6% in the placebo arm. The most frequent (&gt; 1%) Grade 3/4 adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in the RYDAPT arm was renal insufficiency (1%).



 Excluding deaths due to disease progression, no fatal adverse reactions occurred in the study. Overall, the most frequent non-treatment related cause of death in the RYDAPT plus chemotherapy arm was sepsis (2%) and occurred at a similar rate in the placebo arm (2%).



 Table 2 presents the frequency category of adverse reactions reported in the randomized trial in patients with newly diagnosed FLT3 mutated AML. Adverse reactions are listed according to body system. Within each body system, the adverse reactions are ranked by frequency, with the most frequent reactions first. Table 3 presents the key laboratory abnormalities from the same randomized trial in patients with newly diagnosed FLT3 mutated AML.

           In Study 1, 205 patients (120 in RYDAPT arm and 85 in placebo arm) who remained in remission following completion of consolidation continued to receive either single agent RYDAPT or placebo for a median of 11 months (range 0.5 to 17 months) with 69 in the RYDAPT arm and 51 in the placebo completing 12 treatment cycles. Common adverse reactions (greater than or equal to 5% difference between the RYDAPT and placebo arms) reported for these patients included nausea (47% vs. 18%), hyperglycemia (20% vs. 13%) and vomiting (19% vs. 5%).
 

   Systemic Mastocytosis  



 Two single-arm, open-label multicenter trials (Study 2 and Study 3) evaluated the safety of RYDAPT (100 mg twice daily with food) as a single agent in 142 adult patients total with ASM, SM-AHN, or MCL. The median age was 63 (range: 24 to 82), 63% had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, and 75% had no hepatic impairment (bilirubin and AST &lt;= ULN) at baseline. The median duration of exposure to RYDAPT was 11.4 months (range: 0 to 81 months), with 34% treated for &gt;= 24 months.



 The most frequent adverse reactions (&gt;= 20%), excluding laboratory terms, were nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, edema, musculoskeletal pain, abdominal pain, fatigue, upper respiratory tract infection, constipation, pyrexia, headache, and dyspnea (Table 4). Grade &gt;= 3 adverse reactions reported in &gt;= 5%, excluding laboratory terms, were fatigue, sepsis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, pneumonia, diarrhea, febrile neutropenia, edema, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and renal insufficiency (Table 4).



 Adverse reactions led to dose modifications (interruption or reduction) in 56% of patients. Among these, the most frequent adverse reactions (&gt; 5%) were gastrointestinal symptoms, QT prolongation, neutropenia, pyrexia, thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, lipase increase, and fatigue. The median time to first dose modification for toxicity was 1.6 months, with 75% of dose modifications first occurring within 5 months of starting treatment.



 Treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions occurred in 21% of patients. The most frequent adverse reactions causing treatment discontinuation included infection, nausea or vomiting, QT prolongation, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage.



 Serious adverse reactions were reported in 68% of patients, most commonly (&gt;= 20%) due to infections and gastrointestinal disorders.



 On-treatment deaths unrelated to the underlying malignancy occurred in 16 patients (11%), most commonly from infection (sepsis or pneumonia), followed by cardiac events. Of the on-treatment deaths from disease progression, 4 were also attributable to infection.



 Table 4 summarizes the adverse reactions reported in &gt;= 10% of the patients with advanced SM.

   EXCERPT:    *  Embryo-fetal Toxicity: RYDAPT may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise of the potential risk to a fetus. (  5.1  ,  8.1  ). 
 *  Pulmonary Toxicity: Monitor for symptoms of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis. Discontinue RYDAPT in patients with signs or symptoms of pulmonary toxicity. Fatal cases have occurred. (  5.2  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal reproduction studies, RYDAPT may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. In animal studies, midostaurin caused embryo-fetal toxicities, including late embryo-fetal death and reduced fetal birth weight, with delays in fetal growth at doses lower than the recommended human dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential within 7 days prior to initiating RYDAPT therapy. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with RYDAPT and for at least 4 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners to use effective contraception during treatment with RYDAPT and for 4 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)].  



    5.2 Pulmonary Toxicity



  Cases of interstitial lung disease and pneumonitis, some fatal, have occurred in patients treated with RYDAPT as monotherapy or with chemotherapy. Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms. Discontinue RYDAPT in patients who experience signs or symptoms of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis without an infectious etiology.
