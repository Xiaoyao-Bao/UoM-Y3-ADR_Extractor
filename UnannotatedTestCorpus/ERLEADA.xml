  6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 SPARTAN, a randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center clinical study, enrolled patients who had non-metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (NM-CRPC). In this study, patients received either ERLEADA at a dose of 240 mg daily or a placebo. All patients in the SPARTAN study received a concomitant gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog or had a bilateral orchiectomy. The median duration of exposure was 16.9 months (range: 0.1 to 42 months) in patients who received ERLEADA and 11.2 months (range: 0.1 to 37 months) in patients who received placebo.



 Overall, 8 patients (1%) who were treated with ERLEADA died from adverse reactions. The reasons for death were infection (n=4), myocardial infarction (n=3), and cerebral hemorrhage (n=1). One patient (0.3%) treated with placebo died from an adverse reaction of cardiopulmonary arrest (n=1). ERLEADA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 11% of patients, most commonly from rash (3%). Adverse reactions leading to dose interruption or reduction of ERLEADA occurred in 33% of patients; the most common (&gt;1%) were rash, diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, hypertension, and hematuria. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 25% of ERLEADA-treated patients and 23% in patients receiving placebo. The most common serious adverse reactions (&gt;2%) were fracture (3%) in the ERLEADA arm and urinary retention (4%) in the placebo arm.



 Table 1 shows adverse reactions occurring in &gt;=10% on the ERLEADA arm in SPARTAN that occurred with a 2% absolute increase in frequency compared to placebo. Table 2 shows laboratory abnormalities that occurred in &gt;=15% of patients, and more frequently (&gt;5%) in the ERLEADA arm compared to placebo.

               Rash  
 

 In SPARTAN, rash associated with ERLEADA was most commonly described as macular or maculo-papular. Adverse reactions of rash were reported for 24% of patients treated with ERLEADA versus 6% of patients treated with placebo. Grade 3 rashes (defined as covering &gt; 30% body surface area [BSA]) were reported with ERLEADA treatment (5%) versus placebo (0.3%).



 The onset of rash occurred at a median of 82 days of ERLEADA treatment. Rash resolved in 81% of patients within a median of 60 days (range: 2 to 709 days) from onset of rash. Four (4%) of patients treated with ERLEADA received systemic corticosteroids for treatment of rash. Rash recurred in approximately half of patients who were re-challenged with ERLEADA.



     Hypothyroidism  



 Hypothyroidism was reported for 8% of patients treated with ERLEADA and 2% of patients treated with placebo based on assessments of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) every 4 months. Elevated TSH occurred in 25% of patients treated with ERLEADA and 7% of patients treated with placebo. The median onset was Day 113. There were no Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions. Thyroid replacement therapy was initiated in 7% of patients treated with ERLEADA. Thyroid replacement therapy, when clinically indicated, should be initiated or dose-adjusted  [see  Drug Interactions (7.2)  ]  .

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Falls and Fractures occurred in 16% and 12% of patients receiving ERLEADA, respectively. Evaluate patients for fracture and fall risk, and treat patients with bone targeted agents according to established guidelines. (  5.1  ) 
 *  Seizure occurred in 0.2% of patients receiving ERLEADA. Permanently discontinue ERLEADA in patients who develop a seizure during treatment. (  5.2  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Falls and Fractures



  Falls and fractures occurred in patients receiving ERLEADA. Evaluate patients for fracture and fall risk. Monitor and manage patients at risk for fractures according to established treatment guidelines and consider use of bone targeted agents.



 In a randomized study (SPARTAN), falls occurred in 16% of patients treated with ERLEADA compared to 9% of patients treated with placebo. Falls were not associated with loss of consciousness or seizure. Fractures occurred in 12% of patients treated with ERLEADA and in 7% of patients treated with placebo. Grade 3-4 fractures occurred in 3% of patients treated with ERLEADA and in 1% of patients treated with placebo. The median time to onset of fracture was 314 days (range: 20 to 953 days) for patients treated with ERLEADA. Routine bone density assessment and treatment of osteoporosis with bone targeted agents were not performed in the SPARTAN study.



    5.2 Seizure



  Seizure occurred in patients receiving ERLEADA. Permanently discontinue ERLEADA in patients who develop a seizure during treatment. It is unknown whether anti-epileptic medications will prevent seizures with ERLEADA. Advise patients of the risk of developing a seizure while receiving ERLEADA and of engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause harm to themselves or others.



 In a randomized study (SPARTAN), two patients (0.2%) treated with ERLEADA experienced a seizure. Seizure occurred from 354 to 475 days after initiation of ERLEADA. No seizures occurred in patients treated with placebo. Patients with a history of seizure, predisposing factors for seizure, or receiving drugs known to decrease the seizure threshold or to induce seizure were excluded. There is no clinical experience in re-administering ERLEADA to patients who experienced a seizure.
