  The following side effects were observed generally in order of severity: malaise, headache, dizziness, abdominal discomfort with or without nausea, rise in temperature and urticaria. Such side effects may be more frequent and/or serious in patients with a heavy worm burden.



   Post Marketing Adverse Event Reports

  Additional adverse events reported from worldwide post marketing experience and from publications with praziquantel include: abdominal pain, allergic reaction (generalized hypersensitivity, including polyserositis), anorexia, arrhythmia (including bradycardia, ectopic rhythms, ventricular fibrillation, AV blocks), asthenia, bloody diarrhea, convulsion, eosinophilia, fatigue, myalgia, pruritus, rash, somnolence, vertigo and vomiting.

   General



  Approximately 80% of a dose of praziquantel is excreted in the kidneys, almost exclusively (&gt;99%) in the form of metabolites. Excretion might be delayed in patients with impaired renal function, but accumulation of unchanged drug would not be expected. Therefore, dose adjustment for renal impairment is not considered necessary. Nephrotoxic effects of praziquantel or its metabolites are not known.



 Caution should be exercised in the administration of the usual recommended dose of praziquantel to hepatosplenic schistosomiasis patients with moderate to severe liver impairment (Child-Pugh class B and C). Reduced metabolism of praziquantel by the liver in these patients may lead to considerably higher and longer lasting plasma concentrations of unmetabolized praziquantel (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY/Special Populations  ).



 Minimal increases in liver enzymes have been reported in some patients.



 Patients suffering from cardiac irregularities should be monitored during treatment.



 As BILTRICIDE can exacerbate central nervous system pathology due to schistosomiasis, as a general rule this drug should not be administered to individuals reporting a history of epilepsy and/or other signs of potential central nervous systems involvement such as subcutaneous nodules suggestive of cysticercosis.



 When schistosomiasis or fluke infection is found to be associated with cerebral cysticercosis it is advised to hospitalize the patient for the duration of treatment.



 Published in vitro  data have shown a potential lack of efficacy of praziquantel against migrating schistosomulae. Data from two observational cohort studies in patients indicate that treatment with praziquantel in the acute phase of infection may not prevent progression from asymptomatic infection to acute schistosomiasis or from asymptomatic infection/ acute schistosomiasis into chronic phase.



 In addition, the use of praziquantel in patients with schistosomiasis may be associated with clinical deterioration (paradoxical reactions, serum sickness Jarisch-Herxheimer like reactions: sudden inflammatory immune response suspected to be caused by the release of schistosomal antigens). These reactions predominantly occur in patients treated during the acute phase of schistosomiasis. They may lead to potentially life-threatening events, for example, respiratory failure, encephalopathy, and/or cerebral vasculitis.



    Information for Patients



  Patients should be warned not to drive a car and not to operate machinery on the day of BILTRICIDE treatment and the following day.



    Drug Interactions



  Concomitant administration of rifampin, a strong P450 inducer, with praziquantel is contraindicated and must be avoided (see   CONTRAINDICATIONS    ). In a crossover study with a 2-week washout period, 10 healthy subjects ingested a single 40 mg/kg dose of praziquantel following pre-treatment with oral rifampin (600 mg daily for 5 days). Plasma praziquantel concentrations were undetectable in 7 out of 10 subjects. When a single 40 mg/kg dose of praziquantel was administered to these healthy subjects two weeks after discontinuation of rifampin, the mean praziquantel AUC and Cmaxwere 23% and 35% lower, respectively, than when praziquantel was given alone. In patients receiving rifampin, for example, as part of a combination regimen for the treatment of tuberculosis, alternative agents for schistosomiasis should be considered. However, if treatment with praziquantel is necessary, treatment with rifampin should be discontinued 4 weeks before administration of praziquantel. Treatment with rifampin can then be restarted one day after completion of praziquantel treatment.



 Concomitant administration of other drugs that increase the activity of drug metabolizing liver enzymes (P450 inducers), for example, antiepileptic drugs (phenytoin, phenobarbital and carbamazepine), and dexamethasone, may also reduce plasma levels of praziquantel. Concomitant administration of drugs that decrease the activity of drug metabolizing liver enzymes (P 450 inhibitors), for example, cimetidine, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin may increase plasma levels of praziquantel.



 Grapefruit juice was reported to produce a 1.6-fold increase in the Cmaxand a 1.9-fold increase in the AUC of praziquantel. However, the effect of this exposure increase on the therapeutic effect and safety of praziquantel has not been systematically evaluated.



    Mutagenesis, Carcinogenesis, Impairment of Fertility



  Mutagenicity studies of praziquantel published in the scientific literature are inconclusive. Long term oral carcinogenicity studies in rats and golden hamsters did not reveal any carcinogenic effect at doses up to 250 mg/kg/day (about half of the human daily dose based on body surface area). Praziquantel had no effect on fertility and general reproductive performance of male and female rats when given at oral doses ranging from 30 to 300 mg/kg body weight (up to 0.65 times the human daily dose based on body surface area).



    Pregnancy Category B



  Developmental toxicity studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at dose levels of 30 to 300 mg/kg body weight given repeatedly during the period of organogenesis. No harm to the fetus due to praziquantel was observed. These doses were up to 0.65 times (rats) or 1.3 times (rabbits) the highest recommended human daily dose of 75 mg/kg/day, based on body surface area. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. While animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.



    Nursing mothers



  Praziquantel appeared in the milk of nursing women at a concentration of about 1/4 that of maternal serum although it is not known, whether a pharmacological effect is likely to occur in children. Women should not nurse on the day of BILTRICIDE treatment and during the subsequent 72 hours.



    Pediatric use



  Safety in children under 4 years of age has not been established.



    Geriatric use



  Clinical studies of praziquantel did not include a sufficient number of subjects ages 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older patients cannot be ruled out.



 This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in these patients.

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings">    WARNINGS



  Therapeutically effective levels of BILTRICIDE may not be achieved when administered concomitantly with strong P450 inducers, such as rifampin (see   CONTRAINDICATIONS    ).
