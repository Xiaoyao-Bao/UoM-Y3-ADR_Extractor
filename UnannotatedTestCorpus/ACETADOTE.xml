  6.1 Clinical Studies Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 In the literature the most frequently reported adverse reactions attributed to intravenous acetylcysteine administration were rash, urticaria and pruritus. The frequency of adverse reactions has been reported to be between 0.2% and 21%, and they most commonly occur during the initial loading dose of acetylcysteine.



     Loading Dose/Infusion Rate Study  



 In a randomized, open-label, multi-center clinical study conducted in Australia in patients with acetaminophen poisoning, the rates of hypersensitivity reactions between a 15-minute and 60-minute intravenous infusion for the 150 mg/kg loading dose of acetylcysteine were compared.



 The incidence of drug-related adverse reactions occurring within the first 2 hours following acetylcysteine administration is presented in  Table 5  . Overall, 17% of patients developed an acute hypersensitivity reaction (18% in the 15-minute infusion group; 14% in the 60-minute infusion group)  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  ), Clinical Studies (  14  )]  .

                   Safety Study  
 

 A large multi-center study was performed in Canada where data were collected from patients who were treated with intravenous acetylcysteine for acetaminophen overdose between 1980 and 2005. This study evaluated 4709 adult cases and 1905 pediatric cases. The incidence of hypersensitivity reactions in adult (overall incidence 8%) and pediatric (overall incidence 10%) patients is presented in  Tables 6  and  7  .

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *   Hypersensitivity Reactions, Including Hypotension, Wheezing, Shortness of Breath and Bronchospasm: Observe patients during and after the infusion; immediately discontinue infusion if a serious reaction occurs and initiate appropriate treatment. ACETADOTE infusion may be carefully restarted after treatment of hypersensitivity has been initiated (  5.1  ). 
 *   Fluid Overload: Total volume administered should be reduced for patients weighing less than 40 kg and for those requiring fluid restriction (  5.2  ). 
    
 

   5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions



  Serious acute hypersensitivity reactions during acetylcysteine administration including rash, hypotension, wheezing, and/or shortness of breath, have been observed in patients receiving intravenous acetylcysteine for acetaminophen overdose and occurred soon after initiation of the infusion [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . If a severe hypersensitivity reaction occurs, immediately stop the infusion of ACETADOTE and initiate appropriate treatment.



 One patient with asthma developed bronchospasm and died after intravenous administration of acetylcysteine. ACETADOTE should be used with caution in patients with asthma, or where there is a history of bronchospasm. Patients with asthma should be closely monitored during initiation of ACETADOTE therapy and throughout ACETADOTE therapy.



 Acute flushing and erythema of the skin may occur in patients receiving acetylcysteine intravenously. These reactions usually occur 30 to 60 minutes after initiating the infusion and often resolve spontaneously despite continued infusion of acetylcysteine. If a reaction to acetylcysteine involves more than simply flushing and erythema of the skin, it should be treated as a hypersensitivity reaction.



 Management of less severe hypersensitivity reactions should be based upon the severity of the reaction and include temporary interruption of the infusion and/or administration of antihistaminic drugs. The ACETADOTE infusion may be carefully restarted after treatment of the hypersensitivity symptoms has been initiated; however, if the hypersensitivity reaction returns upon re-initiation of treatment or increases in severity, ACETADOTE should be discontinued and alternative patient management should be considered.



    5.2 Fluid Overload



  The total volume of ACETADOTE administered should be adjusted for patients less than 40 kg and for those requiring fluid restriction. To avoid fluid overload, the volume of diluent should be reduced as needed [see Dosage and Administration (  2  )]  . If volume is not adjusted fluid overload can occur, potentially resulting in hyponatremia, seizure and death.



 Intravenous administration of ACETADOTE can cause fluid overload, potentially resulting in hyponatremia, seizure and death. To avoid fluid overload, use the recommended dilution shown in  Tables 2  ,  3  and  4   [see Dosage and Administration (  2.4  )].
