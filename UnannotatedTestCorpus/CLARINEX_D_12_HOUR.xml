  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 The safety data described below are from 2 clinical trials with CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets that included 1248 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis, of which 414 patients received CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets twice daily for up to 2 weeks. The majority of patients were between 18 and &lt;65 years of age with a mean age of 35.8 years and were predominantly women (64%). Patient ethnicity was 82% Caucasian, 9% Black, 6% Hispanic and 3% Asian/other ethnicity. The percentage of subjects receiving CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets and who discontinued from the clinical trials because of an adverse event was 3.6%. Adverse reactions that were reported by &gt;=2% of subjects receiving CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets are shown in  Table 1  .

   6.2 Post-Marketing Experience

  In addition to the adverse reactions reported during clinical trials and listed above, adverse events have been identified during post approval use of CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 Adverse events identified from post-marketing surveillance on the use of CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets include:  Cardiac disorders:  tachycardia, palpitations  Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders:  dyspnea  Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:  rash, pruritus



 In addition to these events, the following spontaneous adverse events have been reported during the marketing of desloratadine as a single ingredient product:  Nervous system disorders:  headache, somnolence, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity, movement disorders (including dystonia, tics, and extrapyramidal symptoms), seizures (reported in patients with and without a known seizure disorder)  Immune system disorders:  hypersensitivity reactions (such as urticaria, edema and anaphylaxis)  Investigations:  elevated liver enzymes including bilirubin  Hepatobiliary disorders:  hepatitis  Metabolism and nutrition disorders:  increased appetite



 Cases of severe skin reactions such as acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with pseudoephedrine-containing products.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Cardiovascular and central nervous system effects: Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders. (  5.1  ) 
 *  Coexisting conditions: Use with caution in patients with increased intraocular pressure, prostatic hypertrophy, diabetes mellitus, or hyperthyroidism. (  5.2  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Cardiovascular and Central Nervous System Effects



  The pseudoephedrine sulfate contained in CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets, like other sympathomimetic amines, can produce cardiovascular and central nervous system (CNS) effects in some patients such as insomnia, dizziness, weakness, tremor, or arrhythmias. In addition, central nervous system stimulation with convulsions or cardiovascular collapse with accompanying hypotension has been reported. Therefore, CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, and should not be used in patients with severe hypertension or severe coronary artery disease.



    5.2 Coexisting Conditions



  CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets contain pseudoephedrine sulfate, a sympathomimetic amine, and therefore should be used with caution in patients with diabetes and hyperthyroidism. Also use with caution in patients with prostatic hypertrophy or increased intraocular pressure, as urinary retention and narrow-angle glaucoma may occur [see  Contraindications (4)  ].  



    5.3 Co-Administration with Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) Inhibitors



  CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets should not be used in patients receiving monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor therapy or within fourteen (14) days of stopping such treatment as an increase in blood pressure or hypertensive crisis, may occur [see  Contraindications (4)  and  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ].  



    5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions



  Hypersensitivity reactions including rash, pruritus, urticaria, edema, dyspnea, and anaphylaxis have been reported after administration of desloratadine a component of CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets. If such a reaction occurs, therapy with CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets should be stopped and alternative treatment should be considered [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ].  



    5.5 Renal Impairment



  CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets should generally be avoided in patients with renal impairment [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ].  



    5.6 Hepatic Impairment



  CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets should generally be avoided in patients with hepatic impairment [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ].
