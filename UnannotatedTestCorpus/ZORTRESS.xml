      6.2       Clinical Trials Experience
   Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed cannot be directly compared to rates in other trials and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



   Kidney Transplantation  



 The data described below reflect exposure to Zortress in an open-label, randomized trial of  de novo  kidney transplant patients of concentration-controlled everolimus at an initial Zortress starting dose of 1.5 mg per day [target trough concentrations 3 to 8 ng/mL with reduced exposure cyclosporine (N = 274) compared to mycophenolic acid (N = 273) with standard exposure cyclosporine]. All patients received basiliximab induction therapy and corticosteroids. The population was between 18 and 70 years, more than 43% were 50 years of age or older (mean age was 46 years in the Zortress group, 47 years control group); a majority of recipients were male (64% in the Zortress group, 69% control group); and a majority of patients were Caucasian (70% in the Zortress group, 69% control group). Demographic characteristics were comparable between treatment groups. The most frequent diseases leading to transplantation were balanced between groups and included hypertension/nephrosclerosis, glomerulonephritis/glomerular disease and diabetes mellitus. Significantly more patients discontinued Zortress 1.5 mg per day treatment (83/277, 30%) than discontinued the control regimen (60/277, 22%). Of those patients who prematurely discontinued treatment, most discontinuations were due to adverse reactions: 18% in the Zortress group compared to 9% in the control group (p-value = 0.004). This difference was more prominent between treatment groups among female patients. In those patients discontinuing study medication, adverse reactions were collected up to 7 days after study medication discontinuation and serious adverse reactions up to 30 days after study medication discontinuation.



 Discontinuation of Zortress at a higher dose (3 mg per day) was 95/279, 34%, including 20% due to adverse reactions, and this regimen is not recommended (see below).



 The overall incidences of serious adverse reactions were 57% (159/278) in the Zortress group and 52% (141/273) in the mycophenolic acid group. Infections and infestations reported as serious adverse reactions had the highest incidence in both groups [20% (54/274) in the Zortress group and 25% (69/273) in the control group]. The difference was mainly due to the higher incidence of viral infections in the mycophenolic acid group, mainly CMV and BK virus infections. Injury, poisoning and procedural complications reported as serious adverse reactions had the second highest incidence in both groups [14% (39/274) in the Zortress group and 12% (32/273) in the control group] followed by renal and urinary disorders [10% (28/274) in the Zortress group and 13% (36/273) in the control group] and vascular disorders [10% (26/274) in the Zortress group and 7% (20/273) in the control group].



 A total of 13 patients died during the first 12 months of study; 7 (3%) in the Zortress group and 6 (2%) in the control group. The most common causes of death across the study groups were related to cardiac conditions and infections.



 There were 12 (4%) graft losses in the Zortress group and 8 (3%) in the control group over the 12 month study period. Of the graft losses, 4 were due to renal artery and two due to renal vein thrombosis in the Zortress group (2%) compared to two renal artery thromboses in the control group (1%)  [    s    ee    Boxed Warning,    Warnings and Precautions (5.    4    )    ]    .  



 The most common (greater than or equal to 20%) adverse reactions observed in the Zortress group were: peripheral edema, constipation, hypertension, nausea, anemia, urinary tract infection, and hyperlipidemia.



   Infections  



 The overall incidence of bacterial, fungal and viral infections reported as adverse reactions was higher in the control group (68%) compared to the Zortress group (64%) and was primarily due to an increased number of viral infections (21% in the control group and 10% in the Zortress group). The incidence of CMV infections reported as adverse reactions was 8% in the control group compared to 1% in the Zortress group; and 3% of the serious CMV infections in the control group versus 0% in the Zortress group were considered serious   [    see    Warnings and Precautions (5.3)    ]    .  



   BK Virus  



 BK virus infections were lower in incidence in the Zortress group (2 patients, 1%) compared to the control group (11 patients, 4%). One of the two BK virus infections in the Zortress group, and two of the 11 BK virus infections in the control group were also reported as serious adverse reactions. BK virus infections did not result in graft loss in any of the groups in the clinical trial.



   Wound Healing and Fluid Collections  



 Wound healing-related reactions were identified through a retrospective search and request for additional data. The overall incidence of wound-related reactions, including lymphocele, seroma, hematoma, dehiscence, incisional hernia, and infections was 35% in the Zortress group compared to 26% in the control group. More patients required intraoperative repair debridement or drainage of incisional wound complications and more required drainage of lymphoceles and seromas in the Zortress group compared to control.



 Adverse reactions due to major fluid collections such as edema and other types of fluid collections was 45% in the Zortress group and 40% in the control group   [    see    Warnings and Precautions (    5.    9    )    ]    .  



   Neoplasms  



 Adverse reactions due to malignant and benign neoplasms were reported in 3% of patients in the Zortress group and 6% in the control group. The most frequently reported neoplasms in the control group were basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, skin papilloma and seborrheic keratosis. One patient in the Zortress group who underwent a melanoma excision prior to transplantation died due to metastatic melanoma   [    see    Boxed Warning,     Warnings and Precautions         (5.2)    ]    .       



   New    O    nset    D    iabetes    M    ellitus (NODM)  



 NODM reported based on adverse reactions and random serum glucose values, was 9% in the Zortress group compared to 7% in the control group.



   Endocrine Effects in Males  



 In the Zortress group, serum testosterone levels significantly decreased while the FSH levels significantly increased without significant changes being observed in the control group. In both the Zortress and the control groups mean testosterone and FSH levels remained within the normal range with the mean FSH level in the Zortress group being at the upper limit of the normal range (11.1 U/L). More patients were reported with erectile dysfunction in the Zortress treatment group compared to the control group (5% compared to 2%, respectively).



 Table 2 compares the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse reactions reported with an incidence of greater than or equal to 10% for patients receiving Zortress with reduced dose cyclosporine or mycophenolic acid with standard dose cyclosporine. Within each MedDRA system organ class, the adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing frequency.

 Adverse reaction that occurred with at least a 5% higher frequency in the Zortress 1.5 mg group compared to the control group were: peripheral edema (45% compared to 40%), hyperlipidemia (21% compared to 16%), dyslipidemia (15% compared to 9%), and stomatitis/mouth ulceration (8% compared to 3%).



 A third treatment group of Zortress 3 mg per day (1.5 mg twice daily; target trough concentrations 6 to 12 ng/mL) with reduced exposure cyclosporine was included in the study described above. Although as effective as the lower dose Zortress group, the overall safety was worse and consequently higher doses of Zortress cannot be recommended. Out of 279 patients, 95 (34%) discontinued the study medication with 57 (20%) doing so because of adverse reactions. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of Zortress when used at this higher dose were injury, poisoning and procedural complications (Zortress 1.5 mg: 5%, Zortress 3 mg: 7%, and control: 2%), infections (2%, 6%, and 3%, respectively), renal and urinary disorders (4%, 7%, and 4%, respectively) and gastrointestinal disorders (1%, 3%, and 2%).



 The combination of fixed dose Zortress and standard doses of cyclosporine in previous kidney clinical trials resulted in frequent elevations of serum creatinine with higher mean and median serum creatinine values observed than in the current study with reduced exposure cyclosporine. These results indicate that Zortress increases the cyclosporine-induced nephrotoxicity; and therefore should only be used in a concentration-controlled regimen with reduced exposure cyclosporine   [    see    Boxed Warnings, Indications and Usage (1.    1    )    ,    Warnings and Precautions (5.    6    )    ]    .  



   Liver Transplantation  



 The data described below reflect exposure to Zortress starting 30 days after transplantation in an open-label, randomized trial of liver transplant patients. Seven hundred and nineteen (719) patients who fulfilled the inclusion/exclusion criteria  [    see    Clinical    Studies    (14.2    )    ]   were randomized into one of the three treatment groups of the study. During the first 30 days prior to randomization patients received tacrolimus and corticosteroids, with or without mycophenolate mofetil (about 70% to 80% received MMF). No induction antibody was administered. At randomization, MMF was discontinued and patients were randomized to Zortress initial dose of 1 mg twice per day (2 mg daily) and adjusted to protocol specified target trough concentrations of 3 to 8 ng/mL with reduced exposure tacrolimus [protocol specified target troughs 3 to 5 ng/mL] (N = 245)  [    see    Clinical Pharmacology (12.7, 12.9)]   or to a control group of standard exposure tacrolimus [protocol specified target troughs 8 to 12 ng/mL up to Month 4 posttransplant, then 6 to 10 ng/mL Month 4 through Month 12 posttransplant] (N = 241). A third randomized group was discontinued prematurely  [    see    Clinical Studies (14.2)    ]  and is not described in this section.



 The population was between 18 and 70 years, more than 50% were 50 years of age (mean age was 54 years in the Zortress group, 55 years in the tacrolimus control group); 74% were male in both Zortress and control groups, respectively, and a majority were Caucasian (86% Zortress group, 80% control group). Demographic characteristics were comparable between treatment groups. The most frequent diseases leading to transplantation were balanced between groups. The most frequent causes of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) were alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatitis C, and hepatocellular carcinoma and were balanced between groups.



 Twenty-seven percent (27%) discontinued study drug in the Zortress group compared with 22% for the tacrolimus control group during the first 12 months of study. The most common reason for discontinuation of study medication was due to adverse reactions (19% and 11%, respectively), including proteinuria, recurrent hepatitis C, and pancytopenia in the Zortress group. At 24 months, the rate of discontinuation of study medication in liver transplant patients was greater for the Zortress group (42%) compared to tacrolimus control group (33%). 



 The overall incidences of serious adverse reactions were 50% (122/245) in the Zortress group and 43% (104/241) in the control group at 12 months and similar at 24 months (56% and 54% respectively). Infections and infestations were reported as serious adverse reactions with the highest incidence followed by gastrointestinal disorders and hepatobiliary disorders. 



 During the first 12 months of study, 13 deaths were reported in the Zortress group (one patient never took Zortress). In the same 12 month period, 7 deaths were reported in the tacrolimus control group. Deaths occurred in both groups for a variety of reasons and were mostly associated with liver-related issues, infections and sepsis. In the following 12 months of study, four additional deaths were reported in each treatment group.



 The most common adverse reactions (reported for greater or equal to 10% patients in any group) in the Zortress group were: diarrhea, headache, peripheral edema, hypertension, nausea, pyrexia, abdominal pain, and leukopenia (  see Table    3  ).



   Infections  



 The overall incidence of infections reported as adverse reactions was 50% for Zortress and 44% in the control group and similar at 24 months (56% and 52% respectively). The types of infections were reported as follows: bacterial 16% vs 12%, viral 17% vs 13%; and fungal infections 2% vs 5% for Zortress and control, respectively   [    see    Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]    .       



   Wound Healing and Fluid Collections  



 Wound healing complications were reported as adverse reactions for 11% of patients in the Zortress group compared to 8% of patients in the control group up to 24 months. Pleural effusions were reported in 5% in both groups, and ascites in 4% of patients in the Zortress group and 3% in the control arm. 



   Neoplasms  



 Malignant and benign neoplasms were reported as adverse reactions in 4% of patients in the Zortress group and 7% in the control group at 12 months. In the Zortress group, 3 malignant tumors were reported compared to 9 cases in the control group. For the Zortress group this included lymphoma, lymphoproliferative disorder and a hepatocellular carcinoma, and for the control group included Kaposi's sarcoma (2), metastatic colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, malignant hepatic neoplasm, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, hemophagocytic histiocytosis, and squamous cell carcinomas. At 24 months, the rates of malignancies were similar (10% and 11% respectively) [  s    ee    Boxed Warning,     Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]. 



   Lipid    A    bnormalities  



 Hyperlipidemia adverse reactions (including the preferred terms: hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, blood cholesterol increased, blood triglycerides increased, hypertriglyceridemia lipids increased, total cholesterol/HDL ratio increased, and dyslipidemia) were reported for 24% Zortress patients, and 10% control patients at 12 months. Results were similar at 24 months (28% and 12% respectively). 



   New Onset of Diabetes after Transplant (NODAT)  



 Of the patients without diabetes mellitus at randomization, NODAT was reported in 32% in the Zortress group compared to 29% in the control group at 12 months and similar at 24 months.



 Table 3 compares the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse reactions reported with an incidence of greater than or equal to 10% for patients receiving Zortress with reduced exposure tacrolimus or standard dose tacrolimus from randomization to 24 months. Within each MedDRA system organ class, the adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing frequency.

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings and precautions">     5        WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  



  EXCERPT:    Angioedema [increased risk with concomitant angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE inhibitors)]:  Monitor for symptoms and treat promptly (  5.8  )



  Delayed Wound Healing/Fluid Accumulation:  Monitor symptoms; treat promptly to minimize complications (  5.9  )



  Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Non-Infectious Pneumonitis:  Monitor for symptoms or radiologic changes; manage by dose reduction or discontinuation until symptoms resolve; consider use of corticosteroids (  5.10  )



  Hyperlipidemia (elevations of serum cholesterol and triglycerides):  Monitor and consider anti-lipid therapy (  5.11  )



  Proteinuria (increased risk with higher trough concentrations):   Monitor urine protein (  5.12  ) 



  Polyoma Virus Infections (activation of latent viral infections; BK-virus associated nephropathy):  Consider reducing immunosuppression (  5.13  )



   TMA/TTP/HUS (concomitant use with cyclosporine may increase risk):   Monitor for hematological changes or symptoms (  5.15  )



   New Onset Diabetes After Transplantation:  Monitor serum glucose (  5.16  )



  Male Infertility:  Azospermia or oligospermia may occur (  5.18  ,  13.1  )



  Immunizations:  Avoid live vaccines (  5.19  )



  Embryo-Fetal Toxicity:  Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception during treatment with Zortress and for 8 weeks after final dose (  5.17  ,  8.1  ,  8.3  )



 



   5.1       Management of Immunosuppression



  Only physicians experienced in management of systemic immunosuppressant therapy in transplantation should prescribe Zortress. Patients receiving the drug should be managed in facilities equipped and staffed with adequate laboratory and supportive medical resources. The physician responsible for the maintenance therapy should have complete information requisite for the follow-up of the patient. In limited data with the complete elimination of calcineurin inhibition (CNI), there was an increased risk of acute rejection.



    5.2       Lymphomas and Other Malignancies



  Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including Zortress, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin. The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent.



 As usual for patients with increased risk for skin cancer, exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor.



    5.3       Serious Infections



  Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including Zortress, are at increased risk of developing bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoal infections, including opportunistic infections  [   s   ee   Warnings and Precautions (   5.1   3   )   ,   Adverse Reactions (6.   1, 6.   2)]   .      These infections may lead to serious, including fatal, outcomes. Because of the danger of over-immunosuppression, which can cause increased susceptibility to infection, combination immunosuppressant therapy should be used with caution.



 Antimicrobial prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jiroveci  ( carinii  ) pneumonia and prophylaxis for cytomegalovirus (CMV) is recommended in transplant recipients.



    5.4       Kidney Graft Thrombosis



  An increased risk of kidney arterial and venous thrombosis, resulting in graft loss, has been reported, usually within the first 30 days posttransplantation  [   s   ee   Boxed Warning]   .  



    5.5       Hepatic Artery Thrombosis



  Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors are associated with an increase in hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT). Reported cases mostly have occurred within the first 30 days posttransplant and most also lead to graft loss or death. Therefore, Zortress should not be administered earlier than 30 days after liver transplant.



    5.6       Zortress and Calcineurin Inhibitor-Induced Nephrotoxicity



  In kidney transplant recipients, Zortress with standard dose cyclosporine increases the risk of nephrotoxicity resulting in a lower glomerular filtration rate. Reduced doses of cyclosporine are required for use in combination with Zortress in order to reduce renal dysfunction  [   see   Boxed Warning, Indications and Usage (1.   1   ), Clinical Pharmacology (12.   8   )]   .      



 In liver transplant recipients, Zortress has not been studied with standard dose tacrolimus. Reduced doses of tacrolimus should be used in combination with Zortress in order to minimize the potential risk of nephrotoxicity  [   s   ee   Indications and Usage (1.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.   9   )]   .      



 Renal function should be monitored during the administration of Zortress. Consider switching to other immunosuppressive therapies if renal function does not improve after dose adjustments or if the dysfunction is thought to be drug related. Caution should be exercised when using other drugs which are known to impair renal function.



    5.7       Heart Transplantation



  In a clinical trial of de novo  heart transplant patients, Zortress in an immunosuppressive regimen with or without induction therapy, resulted in an increased mortality often associated with serious infections within the first three months posttransplantation compared to the control regimen. Use of Zortress in heart transplantation is not recommended.



    5.8       Angioedema



  Zortress has been associated with the development of angioedema. The concomitant use of Zortress with other drugs known to cause angioedema, such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may increase the risk of developing angioedema.



    5.9       Wound Healing and Fluid Accumulation



  Zortress increases the risk of delayed wound healing and increases the occurrence of wound-related complications like wound dehiscence, wound infection, incisional hernia, lymphocele and seroma. These wound-related complications may require more surgical intervention. Generalized fluid accumulation, including peripheral edema (e.g., lymphoedema) and other types of localized fluid collection, such as pericardial and pleural effusions and ascites have also been reported.



    5.10       Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Non-Infectious Pneumonitis



  A diagnosis of interstitial lung disease (ILD) should be considered in patients presenting with symptoms consistent with infectious pneumonia but not responding to antibiotic therapy and in whom infectious, neoplastic and other non-drug causes have been ruled out through appropriate investigations. Cases of ILD, implying lung intraparenchymal inflammation (pneumonitis) and/or fibrosis of non-infectious etiology, some reported with pulmonary hypertension [including pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)] as a secondary event, have occurred in patients receiving rapamycins and their derivatives, including Zortress. Most cases generally resolve on drug interruption with or without glucocorticoid therapy. However, fatal cases have also occurred.



    5.11       Hyperlipidemia



  Increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides, requiring the need for anti-lipid therapy, have been reported to occur following initiation of Zortress and the risk of hyperlipidemia is increased with higher everolimus whole blood trough concentrations  [   see   Adverse   R   eactions (6.2)   ]   .  Use of anti-lipid therapy may not normalize lipid levels in patients receiving Zortress. 



 Any patient who is administered Zortress should be monitored for hyperlipidemia. If detected, interventions, such as diet, exercise, and lipid-lowering agents should be initiated as outlined by the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines. The risk/benefit should be considered in patients with established hyperlipidemia before initiating an immunosuppressive regimen containing Zortress. Similarly, the risk/benefit of continued Zortress therapy should be reevaluated in patients with severe refractory hyperlipidemia. Zortress has not been studied in patients with baseline cholesterol levels greater than 350 mg/dL.



 Due to an interaction with cyclosporine, clinical trials of Zortress and cyclosporine in kidney transplant patients strongly discouraged patients from receiving the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors simvastatin and lovastatin. During Zortress therapy with cyclosporine, patients administered an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and/or fibrate should be monitored for the possible development of rhabdomyolysis and other adverse effects, as described in the respective labeling for these agents  [   see   Drug Interactions (7   .   7   )]   .  



    5.12       Proteinuria



  The use of Zortress in transplant patients has been associated with increased proteinuria. The risk of proteinuria increased with higher everolimus whole blood trough concentrations. Patients receiving Zortress should be monitored for proteinuria  [   see       Adverse Reactions (6.2)   ]   .  



    5.13       Polyoma Virus Infections



  Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including Zortress, are at increased risk for opportunistic infections; including polyoma virus infections. Polyoma virus infections in transplant patients may have serious, and sometimes fatal, outcomes. These include polyoma virus-associated nephropathy (PVAN), mostly due to BK virus infection, and JC virus associated progressive multiple leukoencephalopathy (PML). PVAN has been observed in patients receiving immunosuppressants, including Zortress. PVAN is associated with serious outcomes; including deteriorating renal function and kidney graft loss [   see   Adverse       Reactions (6.2)   ]   .   Patient monitoring may help detect patients at risk for PVAN. Reductions in immunosuppression should be considered for patients who develop evidence of PVAN or PML. Physicians should also consider the risk that reduced immunosuppression represents to the functioning allograft. 



    5.14       Interaction with Strong Inhibitors and Inducers of CYP3A4



  Coadministration of Zortress with strong CYP3A4-inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, ritonavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) and strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin, rifabutin) is not recommended without close monitoring of everolimus whole blood trough concentrations  [   s   ee       Drug Interactions   (7)]   .  



    5.15       Thrombotic Microangiopathy/Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura/Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (TMA/TTP/HUS)



  The concomitant use of Zortress with cyclosporine may increase the risk of thrombotic microangiopathy/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome. Monitor hematologic parameters  [   see   Adverse Reactions (6   .2   )]   .  



    5.16       New Onset Diabetes after Transplant



  Zortress has been shown to increase the risk of new onset diabetes mellitus after transplant. Blood glucose concentrations should be monitored closely in patients using Zortress.



    5.17       Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



   Based on animal studies and the mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]  , Zortress may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal studies, everolimus caused embryo-fetal toxicity when administered during the period of organogenesis at maternal exposures that were equal to or less than human exposures at the recommended lowest starting dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to avoid becoming pregnant and to use effective contraception while using Zortress and for 8 weeks after ending treatment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]  .  



    5.18       Male Infertility



  Azospermia or oligospermia may be observed [   see       Adverse Reactions   (6.   2   )   ,       Nonclinical Toxicology   (13.1)   ]   .   Zortress is an anti-proliferative drug and affects rapidly dividing cells like the germ cells.



    5.19       Immunizations



  The use of live vaccines should be avoided during treatment with Zortress; examples include (not limited to) the following: intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, yellow fever, varicella, and TY21a typhoid vaccines.



    5.20       Interaction with Grapefruit Juice



  Grapefruit and grapefruit juice inhibit cytochrome P450 3A4 and P-gp activity and should therefore be avoided with concomitant use of Zortress and cyclosporine or tacrolimus.



    5.21       Patients with Hereditary Disorders/Other



  Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take Zortress as this may result in diarrhea and malabsorption.
