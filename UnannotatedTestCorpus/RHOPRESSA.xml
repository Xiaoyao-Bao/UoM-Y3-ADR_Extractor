  EXCERPT:   The most common adverse reaction is conjunctival hyperemia (53%). Other common adverse reactions, approximately 20% include: corneal verticillata, instillation site pain, and conjunctival hemorrhage. (  6.1  )  



   To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact    Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-855-740-1924,    or FDA at1-800-FDA-1088 or  www.fda.gov/medwatch.    



 

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The most common ocular adverse reaction observed in controlled clinical studies with RHOPRESSA dosed once daily was conjunctival hyperemia which was reported in 53% of patients. Other common (approximately 20%) ocular adverse reactions reported were: corneal verticillata, instillation site pain, and conjunctival hemorrhage. Instillation site erythema, corneal staining, blurred vision, increased lacrimation, erythema of eyelid, and reduced visual acuity were reported in 5-10% of patients.



   Corneal Verticillata  



 Corneal verticillata occurred in approximately 20% of the patients in controlled clinical studies. The corneal verticillata seen in RHOPRESSA-treated patients were first noted at 4 weeks of daily dosing. This reaction did not result in any apparent visual functional changes in patients. Most corneal verticillata resolved upon discontinuation of treatment.

   5.1 Bacterial Keratitis



  There have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of multiple-dose containers of topical ophthalmic products. These containers had been inadvertently contaminated by patients who, in most cases, had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface [see Patient Counseling Information (  17  )  ].



    5.2 Use with Contact Lenses



  Contact lenses should be removed prior to instillation of RHOPRESSA and may be reinserted 15 minutes following its administration.
