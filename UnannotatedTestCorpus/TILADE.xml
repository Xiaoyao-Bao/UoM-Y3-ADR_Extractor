    Tilade  is generally well tolerated. Adverse event information was derived from 6,469 patients receiving  Tilade  in controlled and open-label clinical trials of 1-52 weeks in duration. A total of 4,400 patients received two inhalations four times a day. An additional 2,069 patients received two inhalations twice daily or another dose regimen. Seventy-seven percent of patients were treated with  Tilade  for eight weeks or longer.



 Of the 4,400 patients who received two inhalations of  Tilade  four times a day, 2,632 were in placebo-controlled, parallel trials and of these 6.0% withdrew from the trials due to adverse events, compared to 5.7% of the 2,446 patients who received placebo.



 The reasons for withdrawal were generally similar in the  Tilade  and placebo-treated groups, except that patients withdrew due to bad taste statistically more frequently on  Tilade  than on placebo. Headache reported as severe or very severe, some with nausea and ill feeling, was experienced by 1.0% of  Tilade  patients and 0.7% of placebo patients.



 The events reported with a frequency of 1% or greater across all placebo-controlled studies are displayed for all patients ages 6 years and older who received  Tilade  or placebo at two inhalations four times daily.



 The adverse event profile observed in children ages 6 through 11 was similar to that observed in adults.

           Other adverse events present at less than the 1% level of occurrence, but that might be related to  Tilade  administration, include arthritis, tremor, and a sensation of warmth.
 

 In clinical trials with 2,632 patients receiving  Tilade  , 2 patients (0.08%) developed neutropenia and 3 patients (0.11%) developed leukopenia. Although it is unclear if these reactions were caused by  Tilade  , in several cases these abnormal laboratory tests returned to normal when  Tilade  was discontinued.



 There have been reports of clinically significant elevation of hepatic transaminases (ALT and AST greater than 10 times the upper limit of the normal reference range in one patient) associated with the administration of  Tilade  . It is unclear if these abnormal laboratory tests in asymptomatic patients were caused by  Tilade  .



 Cases of bronchospasm immediately following dosing with  Tilade  have been reported from postmarketing experience. (See    WARNINGS    .) Isolated cases of pneumonitis with eosinophilia (PIE syndrome) and anaphylaxis have also been reported in which a relationship to drug is undetermined.

   General



  The role of Tilade  as a corticosteroid-sparing agent in patients receiving oral or inhaled corticosteroids remains to be defined. If systemic or inhaled corticosteroid therapy is reduced in patients receiving Tilade  , careful monitoring is necessary.



    Information for Patients



  Patients should be told that:



 *   Tilade must be taken regularly to achieve benefit, even during symptom-free periods. 
 *   Tilade is not meant to relieve acute asthma symptoms. If symptoms do not improve or the patient's condition worsens, the patient should not increase the dosage but should notify the physician immediately. 
 *  They should not decrease the dose without the physician's knowledge. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. 
 *  The full therapeutic effect of Tilade may not be obtained for 1 week or longer after initiating treatment. 
 *  Because the therapeutic effect depends upon local delivery to the lungs, it is essential that patients be properly instructed in the correct method of use (see  Patient Instructions for Use  ). 
 *  An illustrated leaflet for the patient is included in each Tilade Inhaler pack. 
       Drug Interactions
 

  In clinical studies, Tilade  has been co-administered with other anti-asthma medications, including inhaled and oral bronchodilators, and inhaled corticosteroids, with no evidence of increased frequency of adverse events or laboratory abnormalities. No formal drug-drug interaction studies, however, have been conducted.



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility



  A two-year inhalation carcinogenicity study of nedocromil sodium at a dose of 24 mg/kg/day (approximately 8 times the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m  2  basis) in Wistar rats showed no carcinogenic potential. A 21-month oral dietary carcinogenicity study of nedocromil sodium performed in B6C3F1 mice with doses up to 180 mg/kg/day (approximately 30 times the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m  2  basis) showed no carcinogenic potential.



 Nedocromil sodium showed no mutagenic potential in the Ames Salmonella/microsome plate assay, mitotic gene conversion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae  , mouse lymphoma forward mutation, and mouse micronucleus assays.



 Reproduction and fertility studies in mice and rats showed no effects on male and female fertility at a subcutaneous dose of 100 mg/kg/day (approximately 30 times and 60 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m  2  basis).



    Pregnancy



  Reproduction studies performed in mice, rats, and rabbits using a subcutaneous dose of 100 mg/kg/day (approximately 30 times, 60 times, and 116 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m  2  basis) revealed no evidence of teratogenicity or harm to the fetus due to nedocromil sodium. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.



    Nursing Mothers



  It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Tilade  is administered to a nursing woman.



    Pediatric Use



  Safety data in normal volunteers and asthmatic patients between the ages of 6 and 11 years are available on a total of 311 children from U.S. clinical trials and 192 children from foreign clinical trials (total = 503) of 4-12 weeks duration. An additional 225 children received Tilade  for 40 weeks and 24 received Tilade  for 52 weeks.



 The safety and effectiveness of Tilade  in children ages 6 through 11 have been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. (See   CLINICAL STUDIES: Pediatric Studies    .) Use of Tilade  in children ages 6 through 11 years is also supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of Tilade  in adults. The safety and effectiveness of Tilade  in patients below the age of 6 years have not been established.



    Geriatric Use



  Clinical studies of Tilade  did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings">    Warnings



   Tilade  (r)    Inhaler (nedocromil sodium inhalation aerosol) is not a bronchodilator and, therefore, should not be used for the reversal of acute bronchospasm, particularly status asthmaticus. Tilade  should ordinarily be continued during acute exacerbations, unless the patient becomes intolerant to the use of inhaled dosage forms.



 As with other inhaled asthma medications, bronchospasm, which can be life-threatening, may occur immediately after administration. If this occurs, Tilade  should be discontinued and alternative therapy instituted.
