  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The safety of TYBOST is based on Week 144 data from a Phase 3 trial, Study 114, in which 692 HIV-1 infected, antiretroviral treatment-naive subjects received:



 *  TYBOST coadministered with atazanavir and TDF/emtricitabine (administered as TRUVADA) (N=344) or 
 *  ritonavir coadministered with atazanavir and TDF/emtricitabine (administered as TRUVADA) (N=348). 
    The most common adverse reactions (Grades 2-4) and reported in &gt;5% of subjects in the TYBOST group were jaundice (6%) and rash (5%). The proportion of subjects who discontinued study treatment due to adverse events, regardless of severity, was 11% in both the TYBOST and ritonavir groups. Table 2 displays the frequency of adverse reactions (Grades 2-4) occurring in at least 2% of subjects in the TYBOST group in Study 114.

 Selected adverse reactions of at least moderate severity (&gt;=Grade 2) occurring in less than 2% of subjects receiving TYBOST coadministered with atazanavir and TRUVADA are listed below. These events have been included because of the investigator's assessment of potential causal relationship and were considered serious or have been reported in more than one subject treated with TYBOST and with greater frequency compared with ritonavir.



   Gastrointestinal Disorders:  vomiting, upper abdominal pain



   General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions:  fatigue



   Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders:  rhabdomyolysis



   Psychiatric Disorders:  depression, abnormal dreams, insomnia



   Renal and Urinary Disorders:  nephropathy, Fanconi syndrome acquired, nephrolithiasis

In Study 114, increases in serum creatinine and decreases in estimated creatinine clearance occurred early in treatment with TYBOST, after which they stabilized. The mean (+/- SD) change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by Cockcroft-Gault method after 144 weeks of treatment was -15.1 +/- 16.5 mL/min in the TYBOST group and -8.0 +/- 16.8 mL/min in the ritonavir group.
 

       Serum Lipids:    Changes from baseline in total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides are presented in Table 4. In both groups, mean values for serum lipids remained within the study reference range for each laboratory test. The clinical significance of these changes is unknown.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Assess creatinine clearance (CLcr) before initiating treatment. (  5.1  ) 
 *  When TYBOST is used in combination with a TDF containing regimen, cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome have been reported. (  5.2  ) 
 *  Use with TDF: Assess urine glucose and urine protein at baseline and monitor CLcr, urine glucose, and urine protein. Monitor serum phosphorus in patients with or at risk for renal impairment. (  5.2  ) 
 *  TYBOST in combination with more than one antiretroviral that requires pharmacokinetic enhancement (i.e., two protease inhibitors or elvitegravir in combination with a protease inhibitor) is not recommended. (  5.4  ) 
 *  Use with HIV-1 protease inhibitors other than atazanavir or darunavir administered once daily is not recommended. (  5.4  ) 
 *  Coadministration with drugs or regimens containing ritonavir is not recommended. (  5.4  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Effects on Serum Creatinine



  TYBOST decreases estimated creatinine clearance due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine without affecting actual renal glomerular function. This effect should be considered when interpreting changes in estimated creatinine clearance in patients initiating TYBOST, particularly in patients with medical conditions or receiving drugs needing monitoring with estimated creatinine clearance.



 Prior to initiating therapy with TYBOST, assess estimated creatinine clearance [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  . Dosage recommendations are not available for drugs that require dosage adjustments in TYBOST-treated patients with renal impairment [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ,  Drug Interactions (7.3)  , and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)  ]  . Consider alternative medications that do not require dosage adjustments in patients with renal impairment.



 Although TYBOST may cause modest increases in serum creatinine and modest declines in estimated creatinine clearance without affecting renal glomerular function, patients who experience a confirmed increase in serum creatinine of greater than 0.4 mg/dL from baseline should be closely monitored for renal safety.



    5.2 New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment When Used with Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate



  Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome, has been reported when TYBOST was used in an antiretroviral regimen that contained TDF.



 *  Coadministration of TYBOST and TDF is not recommended in patients who have an estimated creatinine clearance below 70 mL/min because dose adjustment of TDF is required below 50 mL/min and such dose adjustments have not been established for coadministration with TYBOST [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2  ,  2.3)  ] . 
 *  Document urine glucose and urine protein at baseline [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ] and perform routine monitoring of estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein during treatment when TYBOST is used with TDF. Measure serum phosphorus in patients with or at risk for renal impairment when used with TDF. 
 *  Coadministration of TYBOST and TDF in combination with concomitant or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent is not recommended. 
    In a clinical trial of TYBOST over 144 weeks (N=692), 10 (2.9%) subjects treated with TYBOST coadministered with atazanavir and TRUVADA  (r)  and 11 (3.2%) subjects treated with ritonavir coadministered with atazanavir and TRUVADA discontinued study drug due to a renal adverse event. Seven of the 10 subjects (2.0% overall) in the TYBOST group had laboratory findings consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy leading to study drug discontinuation compared to 7 of 11 subjects (2.0% overall) in the ritonavir group. One subject in the TYBOST group had renal impairment at baseline (i.e., estimated creatinine clearance less than 70 mL/min). The laboratory findings in these 7 subjects with evidence of proximal tubulopathy improved but did not completely resolve in all subjects upon discontinuation of TYBOST coadministered with atazanavir and TRUVADA. Renal replacement therapy was not required in any subject.
 

    5.3 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions or Loss of Virologic Response Due to Drug Interactions



  Initiation of TYBOST, a CYP3A inhibitor, in patients receiving medications metabolized by CYP3A, or initiation of medications metabolized by CYP3A in patients already receiving TYBOST may increase plasma concentrations of medications metabolized by CYP3A. Initiation of medications that inhibit or induce CYP3A may respectively increase or decrease concentrations of TYBOST with atazanavir or darunavir.



 Increased concentrations may lead to:



 *  clinically significant adverse reactions, potentially leading to severe, life-threatening, or fatal events from higher exposures of concomitant medications. 
 *  clinically significant adverse reactions from higher exposures of TYBOST and atazanavir or darunavir. 
    Decreased antiretroviral concentrations may lead to:
 

 *  loss of therapeutic effect of TYBOST with atazanavir or darunavir and possible development of resistance. 
    See  Table 5  for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations [see  Drug Interactions (7)  ]  . Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during TYBOST with atazanavir or darunavir therapy; review concomitant medications during TYBOST with atazanavir or darunavir therapy; and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with concomitant medications [see  Contraindications (4)  and  Drug Interactions (7)  ]  .
 

 TYBOST or ritonavir when administered with either atazanavir or darunavir may result in different drug interactions when used with concomitant medications. Complex or unknown mechanisms of drug interactions preclude extrapolation of ritonavir drug interactions to certain TYBOST interactions [see  Drug Interactions (7)  , and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ].  



    5.4 Antiretrovirals that are Not Recommended in Combination with TYBOST



  The following antiretrovirals are not recommended in combination with TYBOST because dosing recommendations for such combinations have not been established and coadministration may result in decreased plasma concentrations of the antiretroviral agents, leading to loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance:



 *  More than one antiretroviral that requires pharmacokinetic enhancement (i.e., two protease inhibitors or a protease inhibitor in combination with elvitegravir) 
 *  Darunavir in combination with efavirenz, nevirapine, or etravirine 
 *  Atazanavir in combination with etravirine 
 *  Atazanavir in combination with efavirenz in treatment-experienced patients 
 *  Darunavir 600 mg twice daily 
 *  Other HIV-1 protease inhibitors including fosamprenavir, saquinavir, or tipranavir 
    TYBOST in combination with fixed-dose combination tablets that contain cobicistat is not recommended.
 

 TYBOST in combination with lopinavir/ritonavir or regimens containing ritonavir is not recommended due to similar effects of TYBOST and ritonavir on CYP3A.
