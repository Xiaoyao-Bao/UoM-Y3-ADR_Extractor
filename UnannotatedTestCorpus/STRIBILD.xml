  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     Clinical Trials in HIV-1 Infected Adult Subjects with No Antiretroviral Treatment History  



 The safety assessment of STRIBILD is based on the Week-144 pooled data from 1408 subjects in two randomized, double-blind, active-controlled clinical trials, Study 102 and Study 103, in antiretroviral treatment-naive HIV-1 infected adult subjects  [see  Clinical Studies (14)  ].  A total of 701 subjects received STRIBILD once daily in these two studies.



 The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment with STRIBILD, ATRIPLA, or ATV+RTV+TRUVADA due to adverse events, regardless of severity, was 6.0%, 7.4%, and 8.5%, respectively. Table 1 displays the frequency of adverse reactions greater than or equal to 5% of subjects in any treatment arm.

 Additional adverse reactions observed with STRIBILD included suicidal ideation and suicide attempt (0.3%), all in subjects with a preexisting history of depression or psychiatric illness.



     Clinical Trials in Virologically Suppressed HIV-1 Infected Adult Subjects  



 No new adverse reactions to STRIBILD through Week 48 were identified in 584 virologically stably suppressed adult subjects switching to STRIBILD from a regimen containing a RTV-boosted protease inhibitor (PI) or a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). In a combined analysis of studies 115 and 121, the frequency of adverse reactions (all grades) was 24% in subjects switching to STRIBILD compared to 6% of subjects in either group who stayed on their baseline antiretroviral regimen, RTV-boosted PI+TRUVADA or NNRTI+TRUVADA. Common adverse reactions that occurred in greater than or equal to 2% of subjects switching to STRIBILD were nausea (4%), flatulence (2%), and headache (2%). The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment with STRIBILD, the RTV-boosted PI, or the NNRTI due to adverse events was 2%, 3%, and 1%, respectively.



     Clinical Trials of the Components of STRIBILD in Adult Subjects  



     Emtricitabine and TDF:  In addition to the adverse reactions observed with STRIBILD, the following adverse reactions occurred in at least 5% of treatment-experienced or treatment-naive subjects receiving emtricitabine or TDF with other antiretroviral agents in other clinical trials: depression, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, vomiting, fever, pain, nasopharyngitis, pneumonia, sinusitis, upper respiratory tract infection, arthralgia, back pain, myalgia, paresthesia, peripheral neuropathy (including peripheral neuritis and neuropathy), anxiety, increased cough, and rhinitis.



 Skin discoloration has been reported with higher frequency among emtricitabine-treated subjects; it was manifested by hyperpigmentation on the palms and/or soles and was generally mild and asymptomatic. The mechanism and clinical significance are unknown.



     Laboratory Abnormalities:  



 The frequency of laboratory abnormalities (Grades 3-4) occurring in at least 2% of subjects receiving STRIBILD in studies 102 and 103 are presented in Table 2.

          In Study 103, BMD was assessed by DEXA in a nonrandom subset of 120 subjects (STRIBILD group, N=54; ATV+RTV+TRUVADA group, N=66). Mean percentage decreases in BMD from baseline to Week 144 in the STRIBILD group were comparable to that in the ATV+RTV+TRUVADA group at the lumbar spine (-1.43% versus -3.68%, respectively) and at the hip (-2.83% versus -3.77%, respectively). In studies 102 and 103, bone fractures occurred in 27 subjects (3.9%) in the STRIBILD group, 8 subjects (2.3%) in the ATRIPLA group, and 19 subjects (5.4%) in the ATV+RTV+TRUVADA group. These findings were consistent with data from an earlier 144-week trial of treatment-naive subjects receiving TDF + lamivudine + efavirenz.
 

 Proteinuria (all grades) occurred in 52% of subjects receiving STRIBILD, 41% of subjects receiving ATRIPLA, and 42% of subjects receiving ATV+RTV+TRUVADA.



 The cobicistat component of STRIBILD has been shown to increase serum creatinine and decrease estimated creatinine clearance due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine without affecting renal glomerular function. In studies 102 and 103, increases in serum creatinine and decreases in estimated creatinine clearance occurred early in treatment with STRIBILD, after which levels stabilized. Table 3 displays the mean changes in serum creatinine and eGFR levels at Week 144 and the percentage of subjects with elevations in serum creatinine (all grades).

              Emtricitabine or TDF:  In addition to the laboratory abnormalities observed with STRIBILD, the following laboratory abnormalities have been previously reported in subjects treated with emtricitabine or TDF with other antiretroviral agents in other clinical trials: Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities of ALT (M: greater than 215 U per L; F: greater than 170 U per L), alkaline phosphatase (greater than 550 U per L), bilirubin (greater than 2.5 * ULN), serum glucose (less than 40 or greater than 250 mg per dL), glycosuria (greater than or equal to 3+), neutrophils (less than 750 per mm  3  ), fasting cholesterol (greater than 240 mg per dL), and fasting triglycerides (greater than 750 mg per dL).
 

     Serum Lipids:  In the clinical trials of STRIBILD, a similar percentage of subjects receiving STRIBILD, ATRIPLA, and ATV+RTV+TRUVADA were on lipid-lowering agents at baseline (12%, 12%, and 13%, respectively). While receiving study drug through Week 144, an additional 11% of STRIBILD subjects were started on lipid-lowering agents, compared to 13% of ATRIPLA and 12% of ATV+RTV+TRUVADA subjects.



 Changes from baseline in total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides are presented in Table 4.

                 Clinical Trials in Pediatric Subjects  
 

 The safety of STRIBILD in 50 HIV-1 infected, treatment-naive pediatric subjects aged 12 to less than 18 years and weighing at least 35 kg was evaluated through 48 weeks in an open-label clinical trial (Study 112)  [see  Clinical Studies (14.4)  ].  In this study, the safety profile of STRIBILD was similar to that in adults. Twenty-two subjects (44%) had treatment-emergent proteinuria (Grades 1-2). One subject met laboratory criteria for proximal renal tubulopathy, evidenced by sustained proteinuria and normoglycemic glycosuria beginning at Week 32. The subject continued to receive STRIBILD and was ultimately lost to follow-up.



 Among the 50 pediatric subjects receiving STRIBILD for 48 weeks, mean BMD increased from baseline to Week 48, +0.68% at the lumbar spine and +0.77% for total body less head. Mean changes from baseline BMD Z-scores (height-age adjusted) to Week 48 were -0.09 for lumbar spine and -0.12 for total body less head. At Week 48, 7 STRIBILD subjects had significant (greater than or equal to 4%) lumbar spine BMD loss and 2 had significant total body less head BMD loss.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of TDF. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. No additional postmarketing adverse reactions specific for emtricitabine have been identified.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: POSTTREATMENT ACUTE EXACERBATION OF HEPATITIS B

    WARNING: POSTTREATMENT ACUTE EXACERBATION OF HEPATITIS B  

    Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV and have discontinued EMTRIVA or VIREAD, which are components of STRIBILD. Hepatic function should be monitored closely, with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV and discontinue STRIBILD. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted     [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]    .  



   EXCERPT:   WARNING: POSTTREATMENT ACUTE EXACERBATION OF HEPATITIS B



   See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.  



   Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV who have discontinued EMTRIVA or VIREAD, two of the components of STRIBILD. Hepatic function should be monitored closely in these patients. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted. (  5.1  )  



 
</Section>
    <Section id="S3" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  New onset or worsening renal impairment: Can include acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome. Avoid administering STRIBILD with concurrent or recent use of nephrotoxic drugs. (  5.2  ) 
 *  Lactic acidosis/severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: Discontinue treatment in patients who develop symptoms or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity. (  5.3  ) 
 *  Risk of adverse reactions or loss of virologic response due to drug interactions: The concomitant use of STRIBILD and other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to loss of therapeutic effect of STRIBILD and possible development of resistance; and possible clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of concomitant drugs. (  5.4  ) 
 *  Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD): Consider monitoring BMD in patients with a history of pathologic fracture or other risk factors of osteoporosis or bone loss. (  5.5  ) 
 *  Immune reconstitution syndrome: May necessitate further evaluation and treatment. (  5.6  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Severe Acute Exacerbation of Hepatitis B in Patients Coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV



  All patients with HIV-1 should be tested for the presence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) before initiating antiretroviral therapy [see  Dosage and Administration (2.1)  ]  .



 Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B (e.g., liver decompensated and liver failure) have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV and have discontinued emtricitabine or TDF, two of the components of STRIBILD. Patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment with STRIBILD. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted, especially in patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, since posttreatment exacerbation of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation and liver failure.



    5.2 New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment



  Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia), has been reported with the use of TDF, a component of STRIBILD, and with the use of STRIBILD [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ]  .



 In the clinical trials of STRIBILD over 144 weeks, 13 (1.9%) subjects in the STRIBILD group (N=701), 8 (2.3%) subjects in the atazanavir (ATV) + ritonavir (RTV) + TRUVADA  (r)  (emtricitabine 200 mg/TDF 300 mg) group (N=355), and no subjects in the ATRIPLA  (r)  (efavirenz 600 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/TDF 300 mg) group (N=352) discontinued study drug due to a renal adverse reaction. Of these discontinuations, 8 in the STRIBILD group and 1 in the ATV+RTV+TRUVADA group occurred during the first 48 weeks. Four (0.6%) subjects who received STRIBILD developed laboratory findings consistent with proximal renal tubular dysfunction, leading to discontinuation of STRIBILD during the first 48 weeks of treatment. Two of the four subjects had renal impairment (i.e., estimated creatinine clearance less than 70 mL per minute) at baseline. The laboratory findings in these 4 subjects improved but did not completely resolve in all subjects upon discontinuation of STRIBILD. Renal replacement therapy was not required for these subjects. One (0.3%) subject who received ATV+RTV+TRUVADA developed laboratory findings consistent with proximal renal tubular dysfunction, leading to discontinuation of ATV+RTV+TRUVADA after Week 96.



 STRIBILD should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent (e.g., high-dose or multiple nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) [see  Drug Interactions (7.4)  ]  . Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high-dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in HIV-infected patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on TDF. Some patients required hospitalization and renal replacement therapy. Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered, if needed, in patients at risk for renal dysfunction.



 Persistent or worsening bone pain, pain in extremities, fractures, and/or muscular pain or weakness may be manifestations of proximal renal tubulopathy and should prompt an evaluation of renal function in at-risk patients.



  Prior to initiation and during use of STRIBILD, on a clinically appropriate schedule, assess serum creatinine, estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein in all patients. In patients with chronic kidney disease, also assess serum phosphorus. Discontinue STRIBILD in patients who develop clinically significant decreases in renal function or evidence of Fanconi syndrome. Initiation of STRIBILD in patients with estimated creatinine clearance below 70 mL per minute is not recommended [see  Dosage and Administration (2.1)  ]  .  



 Although cobicistat (a component of STRIBILD) may cause modest increases in serum creatinine and modest declines in estimated creatinine clearance without affecting renal glomerular function [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  , patients who experience a confirmed increase in serum creatinine of greater than 0.4 mg per dL from baseline should be closely monitored for renal safety.



 The emtricitabine and TDF components of STRIBILD are primarily excreted by the kidney. STRIBILD should be discontinued if estimated creatinine clearance declines below 50 mL per minute as dose interval adjustment required for emtricitabine and TDF cannot be achieved with the fixed-dose combination tablet [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.6)  ]  .



    5.3 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis



  Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs, including TDF and emtricitabine, components of STRIBILD, alone or in combination with other antiretrovirals. Treatment with STRIBILD should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations).



    5.4 Risk of Adverse Reactions or Loss of Virologic Response Due to Drug Interactions



  The concomitant use of STRIBILD and other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to [see  Contraindications (4)  and  Drug Interactions (7.5)  ]:  



 *  Loss of therapeutic effect of STRIBILD and possible development of resistance. 
 *  Possible clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of concomitant drugs. 
    See  Table 5  for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations [see  Drug Interactions (7.5)  ]  . Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during STRIBILD therapy; review concomitant medications during STRIBILD therapy; and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drugs.
 

    5.5 Bone Loss and Mineralization Defects



   Bone Mineral Density  



 In clinical trials in HIV-1 infected adults, TDF (a component of STRIBILD) was associated with slightly greater decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) and increases in biochemical markers of bone metabolism, suggesting increased bone turnover relative to comparators. Serum parathyroid hormone levels and 1,25 Vitamin D levels were also higher in subjects receiving TDF. For additional information, [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  and consult the TDF prescribing information.



 Clinical trials evaluating TDF in pediatric and adolescent subjects were conducted. Under normal circumstances, BMD increases rapidly in pediatric patients. In HIV-1 infected subjects aged 2 years to less than 18 years, bone effects were similar to those observed in adult subjects and suggest increased bone turnover. Total body BMD gain was less in the TDF-treated HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects as compared to the control groups. In all pediatric trials, skeletal growth (height) appeared to be unaffected. For more information, please consult the TDF prescribing information.



 The effects of TDF-associated changes in BMD and biochemical markers on long-term bone health and future fracture risk are unknown. Assessment of BMD should be considered for HIV-1 infected adult and pediatric patients who have a history of pathologic bone fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss. Although the effect of supplementation with calcium and Vitamin D was not studied, such supplementation may be beneficial in all patients. If bone abnormalities are suspected, then appropriate consultation should be obtained.



    Mineralization Defects  



 Cases of osteomalacia associated with proximal renal tubulopathy, manifested as bone pain or pain in extremities and which may contribute to fractures, have been reported in association with the use of TDF [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ]  . Arthralgias and muscle pain or weakness have also been reported in cases of proximal renal tubulopathy. Hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia secondary to proximal renal tubulopathy should be considered in patients at risk of renal dysfunction who present with persistent or worsening bone or muscle symptoms while receiving products containing TDF [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]  .



    5.6 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome



  Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including STRIBILD. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium  infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii  pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.



 Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.
