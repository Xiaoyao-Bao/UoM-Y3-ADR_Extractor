      6.1 Clinical Trial Experience
   Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The safety of norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol tablets was evaluated in 743 subjects who participated in an open- label, randomized, active-controlled, multicenter clinical trial of norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol tablets for contraception. This trial examined healthy, non-pregnant volunteers aged 18 to 45 years, who were sexually active and had a body mass index of    35 kg/m2. Subjects were followed for up to six 28-day cycles providing a total of 3,823 treatment-cycles of exposure.



   Common Adverse Reactions (   2% of all subjects)  : The most common adverse reactions reported by at least 2% of the 743 women using norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol tablets were the following, in order of decreasing incidence: headache (6.3%), vaginal candidiasis (6.1%), nausea (4.6%), menstrual cramps (4.4%), breast tenderness (3.4%), mood changes (including mood swings (2.2%) and depression (1.1%)), bacterial vaginitis (3.1%), acne (2.7%), and weight gain (2.0%).



   Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation  : Among the 743 women using norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol tablets, 46 women (6.2%) withdrew because of an adverse event. Adverse events occurring in 3 or more subjects leading to discontinuation of treatment were, in decreasing order: abnormal bleeding (0.9%), nausea (0.8%), mood changes (0.8%), menstrual cramps (0.4%), increased blood pressure (0.4%), and irregular bleeding (0.4%).



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is difficult to reliably estimate their frequency or evaluate a causal relationship to drug exposure.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: CIGARETTE SMOKING AND SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS

  WARNING: CIGARETTE SMOKING AND SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS

  EXCERPT:     WARNING: CIGARETTE SMOKING AND SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS  



     See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.    



 ●   Larin 24 Fe is contraindicated in     women over 35 years old who smoke.   (4)    



 ●   Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from combination oral     contraceptives (COC) use.   (4)    



 



    Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from combination oral contraceptive (COC) use. This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked. For this reason, COCs should not be used by women who are over 35 years of age and smoke   [see Contraindications   (4)  ]  .

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Thrombotic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems: Stop Larin 24 Fe if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding.  (5.1)   
 *  Liver disease: Discontinue LARIN 24 Fe if jaundice occurs.  (5.2)   
 *  High blood pressure: If used in women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop LARIN 24 Fe if blood pressure rises significantly.  (5.4)   
 *  Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking LARIN 24 Fe . Consider an alternative contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia.  (5.6)   
 *  Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue LARIN 24 Fe if indicated.  (5.7)   
 *  Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea.  (5.8)   
    
 

   5.1 Thrombotic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems



    *  Stop LARIN 24 Fe if an arterial thrombotic event or venous thromboembolic (VTE) event occurs. 
 *  Stop LARIN 24 Fe if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately [see Adverse Reactions  (6.2)  ].  
 *  If feasible, stop LARIN 24 Fe at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of VTE as well as during the following prolonged immobilization. 
 *  Start LARIN 24 Fe no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum VTE decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. 
 *  The use of COCs increases the risk of VTE. However, pregnancy increases the risk of VTE as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of VTE in women using COCs is 3 to 9 cases per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of a COCs and when restarting oral contraception after a break of 4 weeks or longer. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued. 
 *  Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes). This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age who smoke. 
 *  Use COCs with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. 
       5.2 Liver Disease
 

   Impaired Liver Function  



 Do not use LARIN 24 Fe in women with liver disease, such as acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of liver [ see  Contraindications (4)  ].  Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Discontinue LARIN 24 Fe if jaundice develops.



  Liver Tumors  



 LARIN 24 Fe is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [see  Contraindications (4)  ].  Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases per 100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage.



 Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (&gt;8 years) COC users. However, the risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users.



    5.3 Risk of Liver Enzyme Elevations with Concomitant Hepatitis C Treatment



  During clinical trials with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen that contains ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, ALT elevations greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), including some cases greater than 20 times the ULN, were significantly more frequent in women using ethinyl estradiol-containing medications, such as COCs. Discontinue LARIN 24 Fe prior to starting therapy with the combination drug regimen ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir [see     Contraindications (4)  ]  . LARIN 24 Fe can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen.



    5.4 High Blood Pressure



  LARIN 24 Fe is contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [see  Contraindications (4)  ]  . For women with well- controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop LARIN 24 Fe if blood pressure rises significantly.



 An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestin.



    5.5 Gallbladder Disease



  Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. Use of COCs may worsen existing gallbladder disease. A past history of COC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use. Women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC related cholestasis.



    5.6 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects



  Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking LARIN 24 Fe. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance.



 Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs.



 Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs.



    5.7 Headache



  If a woman taking LARIN 24 Fe develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue LARIN 24 Fe if indicated.



 Consider discontinuation of LARIN 24 Fe in the case of increased frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event).



    5.8 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea



   Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting  



 Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different contraceptive product.



 In a clinical trial of norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol tablets, the frequency and duration of unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting was assessed in 743 women (3,823 28-day cycles). A total of 10 subjects (1.3%) discontinued norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol tablets, at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting. Based on data from the clinical trial, [24-38%] of women using norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol tablets experienced unscheduled bleeding per cycle in the six months of the trial. The percent of women who experienced unscheduled bleeding tended to decrease over time.



  Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea  



 Women who use LARIN 24 Fe may experience absence of withdrawal bleeding, even if they are not pregnant. In the clinical trial with norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol tablets, 31 to 41% of the women using norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol tablets did not have a withdrawal menses in at least one of 6 cycles of use.



 Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuation of COCs, especially when such a condition was preexistent.



 If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.



    5.9 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy



  Extensive epidemiologic studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned, when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Discontinue LARIN 24 Fe use if pregnancy is confirmed.



 Administration of COCs to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [    see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)   ].  



    5.10 Depression



  Carefully observe women with a history of depression and discontinue LARIN 24 Fe if depression recurs to a serious degree.



    5.11 Carcinoma of the Breast and Cervix



  LARIN 24 Fe is contraindicated in women who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer is a hormonally-sensitive [see  Contraindications (4)  ].  



 There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings.



 Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors.



    5.12 Effect on Binding Globulins



  The estrogen component of COCs may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, sex hormone-binding globulin, and cortisol-binding globulin. The dose of replacement thyroid hormone or cortisol therapy may need to be increased.



    5.13 Monitoring



  A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare.



    5.14 Hereditary Angioedema



  In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema.



    5.15 Chloasma



  Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking LARIN 24 Fe.
