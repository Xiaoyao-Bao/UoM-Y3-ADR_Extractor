    Dextromethorphan:  



 Dextromethorphan hydrobromide occasionally causes slight drowsiness, dizziness, and gastrointestinal disturbances.



   Promethazine:  



 Central Nervous System - Drowsiness is the most prominent CNS effect of this drug. Sedation, somnolence, blurred vision, dizziness; confusion, disorientation, and extrapyramidal symptoms such as oculogyric crisis, torticollis, and tongue protrusion; lassitude, tinnitus, incoordination, fatigue, euphoria, nervousness, diplopia, insomnia, tremors, convulsive seizures, excitation, catatonic-like states, hysteria. Hallucinations have also been reported.



 Cardiovascular - Increased or decreased blood pressure, tachycardia, bradycardia, faintness.



 Dermatologic - Dermatitis, photosensitivity, urticaria.



 Hematologic - Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytopenic purpura, agranulocytosis.



 Gastrointestinal - Dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, jaundice.



 Respiratory - Asthma, nasal stuffiness, respiratory depression (potentially fatal) and apnea (potentially fatal). (See    WARNINGS - Promethazine;      Respiratory Depression  .)



 Other - Angioneurotic edema. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (potentially fatal) has also been reported. (See    WARNINGS - Promethazine;      Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome  .)



 Paradoxical Reactions - Hyperexcitability and abnormal movements have been reported in patients following a single administration of promethazine HCl. Consideration should be given to the discontinuation of promethazine HCl and to the use of other drugs if these reactions occur. Respiratory depression, nightmares, delirium, and agitated behavior have also been reported in some of these patients.

  Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with the drug combination-promethazine and dextromethorphan. It is not known whether this drug combination can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Promethazine and dextromethorphan should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.



    General:



  Dextromethorphan should be used with caution in sedated patients, in the debilitated, and in patients confined to the supine position.



 Drugs having anticholinergic properties should be used with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, stenosing peptic ulcer, pyloroduodenal obstruction, and bladder-neck obstruction.



 Promethazine should be used cautiously in persons with cardiovascular disease or with impairment of liver function.



    Information For Patients:



  Promethazine and dextromethorphan may cause marked drowsiness or impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery. Ambulatory patients should be told to avoid engaging in such activities until it is known that they do not become drowsy or dizzy from promethazine and dextromethorphan therapy. Children should be supervised to avoid potential harm in bike riding or in other hazardous activities.



 The concomitant use of alcohol or other central nervous system depressants, including narcotic analgesics, sedatives, hypnotics, and tranquilizers, may have an additive effect and should be avoided or their dosage reduced.



 Patients should be advised to report any involuntary muscle movements.



 Avoid prolonged exposure to the sun.



    Drug Interactions:



   Dextromethorphan:



  Hyperpyrexia, hypotension, and death have been reported coincident with the coadministration of monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors and products containing dextromethorphan. Thus, concomitant administration of promethazine with dextromethorphan and MAO inhibitors should be avoided (see   CONTRAINDICATIONS    ).



    Promethazine:



   CNS Depressants -  Promethazine may increase, prolong, or intensify the sedative action of other central nervous system depressants, such as alcohol, sedatives/hypnotics (including barbiturates), narcotics, narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, tricyclic antidepressants, and tranquilizers; therefore, such agents should be avoided or administered in reduced dosage to patients receiving promethazine HCl. When given concomitantly with promethazine, the dose of barbiturates should be reduced by at least one-half, and the dose of narcotics should be reduced by one-quarter to one-half. Dosage must be individualized. Excessive amounts of promethazine HCl relative to a narcotic may lead to restlessness and motor hyperactivity in the patient with pain; these symptoms usually disappear with adequate control of the pain.



  Epinephrine -  Because of the potential for promethazine to reverse epinephrine's vasopressor effect, epinephrine should NOT be used to treat hypotension associated with promethazine overdose.



  Anticholinergics -  Concomitant use of other agents with anticholinergic properties should be undertaken with caution.



  Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOI) -  Drug interactions, including an increased incidence of extrapyramidal effects, have been reported when some MAOI and phenothiazines are used concomitantly.



    Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions:



  The following laboratory tests may be affected in patients who are receiving therapy with promethazine hydrochloride.



 Pregnancy Tests: Diagnostic pregnancy tests based on immunological reactions between HCG and anti-HCG may result in false-negative or false-positive interpretations.



 Glucose Tolerance Test: An increase in blood glucose has been reported in patients receiving promethazine.



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility:



  Long-term animal studies have not been performed to assess the carcinogenic potential of promethazine or of dextromethorphan. There are no animal or human data concerning the carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, or impairment of fertility with these drugs. Promethazine was nonmutagenic in the Salmonella    test system of Ames.



    Pregnancy:



   Teratogenic Effects - Pregnancy Category C:  



  Teratogenic effects have not been demonstrated in rat-feeding studies at doses of 6.25 and 12.5 mg/kg of promethazine HCl. These doses are from approximately 2.1 to 4.2 times the maximum recommended total daily dose of promethazine for a 50-kg subject, depending upon the indication for which the drug is prescribed. Daily doses of 25 mg/kg intraperitoneally have been found to produce fetal mortality in rats.



 Specific studies to test the action of the drug on parturition, lactation, and development of the animal neonate were not done, but a general preliminary study in rats indicated no effect on these parameters. Although antihistamines have been found to produce fetal mortality in rodents, the pharmacological effects of histamine in the rodent do not parallel those in man. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of promethazine in pregnant women.



 Promethazine and dextromethorphan should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus.



    Nonteratogenic Effects:



  Promethazine administered to a pregnant woman within two weeks of delivery may inhibit platelet aggregation in the newborn.



    Labor And Delivery:



  Limited data suggest that use of promethazine HCl during labor and delivery does not have an appreciable effect on the duration of labor or delivery and does not increase the risk of need for intervention in the newborn. The effect on later growth and development of the newborn is unknown. See also "  Nonteratogenic Effects  ".



    Nursing Mothers:



  It is not known whether promethazine or dextromethorphan is excreted in human milk.



 Caution should be exercised when promethazine and dextromethorphan is administered to a nursing woman.



    Pediatric Use:



   PROMETHAZINE HYDROCHLORIDE AND DEXTROMETHORPHAN HYDROBROMIDE ORAL SOLUTION IS CONTRAINDICATED FOR USE IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS LESS THAN TWO YEARS OF AGE  (see   WARNINGS - Black Box Warning    and   Use In Pediatric Patients    ).



 Promethazine hydrochloride and dextromethorphan hydrobromide oral solution should be used with caution in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older (see   WARNINGS - Use In Pediatric Patients    ).



    Geriatric Use:



  Clinical studies of promethazine hydrochloride and dextromethorphan hydrobromide oral solution did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.



 Sedating drugs may cause confusion and over-sedation in the elderly; elderly patients generally should be started on low doses of promethazine hydrochloride and dextromethorphan hydrobromide oral solution and observed closely.
