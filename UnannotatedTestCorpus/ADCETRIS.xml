  6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The data below reflect exposure to ADCETRIS in 931 patients with cHL including 662 patients who received ADCETRIS in combination with chemotherapy in a randomized controlled trial, and 269 who received ADCETRIS as monotherapy (167 in a randomized controlled trial and 102 in a single arm trial). Data summarizing ADCETRIS exposure are also provided for 347 patients with T-cell lymphoma, including 223 patients with PTCL who received ADCETRIS in combination with chemotherapy in a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial; 58 patients with sALCL who received ADCETRIS monotherapy in a single-arm trial; and 66 patients with pcALCL or CD30-expressing MF who received ADCETRIS monotherapy in a randomized, controlled trial. ADCETRIS was administered intravenously at a dose of either 1.2 mg/kg every 2 weeks in combination with AVD, 1.8 mg/kg every 3 weeks in combination with CHP, or 1.8 mg/kg every 3 weeks as monotherapy.



 The most common adverse reactions (&gt;=20%) with monotherapy were peripheral neuropathy, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, neutropenia, upper respiratory tract infection, and pyrexia.



 The most common adverse reactions (&gt;=20%) in combination with AVD were peripheral neuropathy, neutropenia, nausea, constipation, vomiting, fatigue, diarrhea, pyrexia, alopecia, decreased weight, abdominal pain, anemia, and stomatitis.



 The most common adverse reactions (&gt;=20%) in combination with CHP were anemia, neutropenia, peripheral neuropathy, lymphopenia, nausea, diarrhea, fatigue or asthenia, mucositis, constipation, alopecia, pyrexia, and vomiting.



     Previously Untreated Stage III or IV Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (Study 5: ECHELON-1)    



 ADCETRIS in combination with AVD was evaluated for the treatment of previously untreated patients with Stage III or IV cHL in a randomized, open-label, multicenter clinical trial of 1334 patients. Patients were randomized to receive up to 6 cycles of ADCETRIS + AVD or ABVD on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. The recommended starting dose of ADCETRIS was 1.2 mg/kg intravenously over 30 minutes, administered approximately 1 hour after completion of AVD therapy. A total of 1321 patients received at least one dose of study treatment (662 ADCETRIS + AVD, 659 ABVD). The median number of treatment cycles in each study arm was 6 (range, 1-6); 76% of patients on the ADCETRIS + AVD arm received 12 doses of ADCETRIS  [see  Clinical Studies (14.1)  ].  



 After 75% of patients had started study treatment, the use of prophylactic G-CSF was recommended with the initiation of treatment for all ADCETRIS + AVD treated patients, based on the observed rates of neutropenia and febrile neutropenia  [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  . Among 579 patients on the ADCETRIS + AVD arm who did not receive G-CSF primary prophylaxis beginning with Cycle 1, 96% experienced neutropenia (21% with Grade 3; 67% with Grade 4), and 21% had febrile neutropenia (14% with Grade 3; 6% with Grade 4). Among 83 patients on the ADCETRIS + AVD arm who received G-CSF primary prophylaxis beginning with Cycle 1, 61% experienced neutropenia (13% with Grade 3; 27% with Grade 4), and 11% experienced febrile neutropenia (8% with Grade 3; 2% with Grade 4).



 Serious adverse reactions, regardless of causality, were reported in 43% of ADCETRIS + AVD-treated patients and 27% of ABVD-treated patients. The most common serious adverse reactions in ADCETRIS + AVD-treated patients were febrile neutropenia (17%), pyrexia (7%), neutropenia and pneumonia (3% each).



 Adverse reactions that led to dose delays of one or more drugs in more than 5% of ADCETRIS + AVD-treated patients were neutropenia (21%) and febrile neutropenia (8%)  [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  . Adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation of one or more drugs in 13% of ADCETRIS + AVD-treated patients. Seven percent of patients treated with ADCETRIS + AVD discontinued due to peripheral neuropathy.



 There were 9 on-study deaths among ADCETRIS + AVD-treated patients; 7 were associated with neutropenia, and none of these patients had received G-CSF prior to developing neutropenia.

        Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma Post-Auto-HSCT Consolidation (Study 3: AETHERA)  
 

 ADCETRIS was studied in 329 patients with cHL at high risk of relapse or progression post-auto-HSCT in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in which the recommended starting dose and schedule was 1.8 mg/kg of ADCETRIS administered intravenously over 30 minutes every 3 weeks or placebo for up to 16 cycles. Of the 329 enrolled patients, 327 (167 ADCETRIS, 160 placebo) received at least one dose of study treatment. The median number of treatment cycles in each study arm was 15 (range, 1-16) and 80 patients (48%) in the ADCETRIS-treatment arm received 16 cycles   [see  Clinical Studies (14.1)  ]  .



 Standard international guidelines were followed for infection prophylaxis for herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and  Pneumocystis jiroveci  pneumonia (PJP) post-auto-HSCT. Overall, 312 patients (95%) received HSV and VZV prophylaxis with a median duration of 11.1 months (range, 0-20) and 319 patients (98%) received PJP prophylaxis with a median duration of 6.5 months (range, 0-20).



 Adverse reactions that led to dose delays in more than 5% of ADCETRIS-treated patients were neutropenia (22%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (16%), upper respiratory tract infection (6%), and peripheral motor neuropathy (6%)  [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]  . Adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation in 32% of ADCETRIS-treated patients. Adverse reactions that led to treatment discontinuation in 2 or more patients were peripheral sensory neuropathy (14%), peripheral motor neuropathy (7%), acute respiratory distress syndrome (1%), paresthesia (1%), and vomiting (1%). Serious adverse reactions were reported in 25% of ADCETRIS-treated patients. The most common serious adverse reactions were pneumonia (4%), pyrexia (4%), vomiting (3%), nausea (2%), hepatotoxicity (2%), and peripheral sensory neuropathy (2%).

 ADCETRIS was studied in 102 patients with cHL in a single arm clinical trial in which the recommended starting dose and schedule was 1.8 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks. Median duration of treatment was 9 cycles (range, 1-16)   [see  Clinical Studies (14.1)  ].  



 Adverse reactions that led to dose delays in more than 5% of ADCETRIS-treated patients were neutropenia (16%) and peripheral sensory neuropathy (13%)  [see    Dosage and Administration (2.3)    ]  . Adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation in 20% of ADCETRIS-treated patients. Adverse reactions that led to treatment discontinuation in 2 or more patients were peripheral sensory neuropathy (6%) and peripheral motor neuropathy (3%). Serious adverse reactions were reported in 25% of ADCETRIS-treated patients. The most common serious adverse reactions were peripheral motor neuropathy (4%), abdominal pain (3%), pulmonary embolism (2%), pneumonitis (2%), pneumothorax (2%), pyelonephritis (2%), and pyrexia (2%).

 ADCETRIS in combination with CHP was evaluated in patients with previously untreated, CD30-expressing PTCL in a multicenter randomized, double-blind, double dummy, actively controlled trial. Patients were randomized to receive ADCETRIS + CHP or CHOP for 6 to 8, 21-day cycles. ADCETRIS was administered on Day 1 of each cycle, with a starting dose of 1.8 mg/kg intravenously over 30 minutes, approximately 1 hour after completion of CHP  [see  Clinical Studies (14.2)]    . The trial required hepatic transaminases &lt;=3 times upper limit of normal (ULN), total bilirubin &lt;=1.5 times ULN, and serum creatinine &lt;=2 times ULN and excluded patients with Grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy.



 A total of 449 patients were treated (223 with ADCETRIS + CHP, 226 with CHOP), with 6 cycles planned in 81%. In the ADCETRIS + CHP arm, 70% of patients received 6 cycles, and 18% received 8 cycles. Primary prophylaxis with G-CSF was administered to 34% of ADCETRIS + CHP-treated patients and 27% of CHOP-treated patients.



 Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 3% of patients in the A+CHP arm and in 4% of patients in the CHOP arms, most often from infection. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 38% of ADCETRIS + CHP- treated patients and 35% of CHOP-treated patients. Serious adverse reactions occurring in &gt;2% of ADCETRIS + CHP-treated patients included febrile neutropenia (14%), pneumonia (5%), pyrexia (4%), and sepsis (3%).



 The most common adverse reactions observed &gt;=2% more in recipients of ADCETRIS + CHP were nausea, diarrhea, fatigue or asthenia, mucositis, pyrexia, vomiting, and anemia. Other common (&gt;=10%) adverse reactions observed &gt;=2% more with ADCETRIS + CHP were febrile neutropenia, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, dyspnea, edema, cough, dizziness, hypokalemia, decreased weight, and myalgia.



 In recipients of ADCETRIS + CHP, adverse reactions led to dose delays of ADCETRIS in 25% of patients, dose reduction in 9% (most often for peripheral neuropathy), and discontinuation of ADCETRIS with or without the other components in 7% (most often from peripheral neuropathy and infection).

 ADCETRIS was studied in 58 patients with sALCL in a single arm clinical trial in which the recommended starting dose and schedule was 1.8 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks. Median duration of treatment was 7 cycles (range, 1-16)  [see  Clinical Studies (14.2  )]  .



 Adverse reactions that led to dose delays in more than 5% of ADCETRIS-treated patients were neutropenia (12%) and peripheral sensory neuropathy (7%)  [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  . Adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation in 19% of ADCETRIS-treated patients. The adverse reaction that led to treatment discontinuation in 2 or more patients was peripheral sensory neuropathy (5%). Serious adverse reactions were reported in 41% of ADCETRIS-treated patients. The most common serious adverse reactions were septic shock (3%), supraventricular arrhythmia (3%), pain in extremity (3%), and urinary tract infection (3%).

 ADCETRIS was studied in 131 patients with pcALCL or CD30-expressing MF requiring systemic therapy in a randomized, open-label, multicenter clinical trial in which the recommended starting dose and schedule was ADCETRIS 1.8 mg/kg intravenously over 30 minutes every 3 weeks or physician's choice of either methotrexate 5 to 50 mg orally weekly or bexarotene 300 mg/m  2  orally daily.



 Of the 131 enrolled patients, 128 (66 brentuximab vedotin, 62 physician's choice) received at least one dose of study treatment. The median number of treatment cycles in the ADCETRIS treatment arm was 12 (range, 1-16) compared to 3 (range, 1-16) and 6 (range, 1-16) in the methotrexate and bexarotene arms, respectively. Twenty-four (24) patients (36%) in the ADCETRIS-treatment arm received 16 cycles compared to 5 patients (8%) in the physician's choice arm  [see  Clinical Studies (14.2)  ].  



 Adverse reactions that led to dose delays in more than 5% of ADCETRIS-treated patients were peripheral sensory neuropathy (15%) and neutropenia (6%)  [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  . Adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation in 24% of ADCETRIS-treated patients. The most common adverse reaction that led to treatment discontinuation was peripheral neuropathy (12%). Serious adverse reactions were reported in 29% of ADCETRIS-treated patients. The most common serious adverse reactions were cellulitis (3%) and pyrexia (3%).

        Additional Important Adverse Reactions  
 

   Infusion reactions  



 In studies of ADCETRIS as monotherapy (Studies 1-4), 13% of ADCETRIS-treated patients experienced infusion-related reactions. The most common adverse reactions in Studies 1-4 (&gt;=3% in any study) associated with infusion-related reactions were chills (4%), nausea (3-4%), dyspnea (2-3%), pruritus (2-5%), pyrexia (2%), and cough (2%). Grade 3 events were reported in 5 of the 51 ADCETRIS-treated patients who experienced infusion-related reactions.



 In a study of ADCETRIS in combination with AVD (Study 5, ECHELON-1), infusion-related reactions were reported in 57 patients (9%) in the ADCETRIS + AVD-treated arm. Grade 3 events were reported in 3 of the 57 patients treated with ADCETRIS + AVD who experienced infusion-related reactions. The most common adverse reaction (&gt;=2%) associated with infusion-related reactions was nausea (2%).



 In a study of ADCETRIS in combination with CHP (Study 6, ECHELON-2), infusion-related reactions were reported in 10 patients (4%) in the ADCETRIS + CHP-treated arm: 2 (1%) patients with events that were Grade 3 or higher events, and 8 (4%) patients with events that were less than Grade 3.



   Pulmonary toxicity  



 In a trial in patients with cHL that studied ADCETRIS with bleomycin as part of a combination regimen, the rate of non-infectious pulmonary toxicity was higher than the historical incidence reported with ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine). Patients typically reported cough and dyspnea. Interstitial infiltration and/or inflammation were observed on radiographs and computed tomographic imaging of the chest. Most patients responded to corticosteroids. The concomitant use of ADCETRIS with bleomycin is contraindicated  [see  Contraindications (4)  ].  



 In a study of ADCETRIS in combination with AVD (Study 5, ECHELON-1), non-infectious pulmonary toxicity events were reported in 12 patients (2%) in the ADCETRIS + AVD arm. These events included lung infiltration (6 patients) and pneumonitis (6 patients), or interstitial lung disease (1 patient).



 In a study of ADCETRIS in combination with CHP (Study 6, ECHELON-2), non-infectious pulmonary toxicity events were reported in 5 patients (2%) in the ADCETRIS + CHP arm; all 5 events were pneumonitis.



 Cases of pulmonary toxicity have also been reported in patients receiving ADCETRIS monotherapy. In Study 3 (AETHERA), pulmonary toxicity was reported in 8 patients (5%) in the ADCETRIS-treated arm and 5 patients (3%) in the placebo arm.



   6.2 Post Marketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ADCETRIS. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

   Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders  : Toxic epidermal necrolysis, including fatal outcomes  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.11)  ]  .



   6.3 Immunogenicity

  As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to ADCETRIS in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading.



 Patients with cHL and sALCL in Studies 1 and 2   [see  Clinical Studies (14.1,     14.2)  ]  were tested for antibodies to brentuximab vedotin every 3 weeks using a sensitive electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. Approximately 7% of patients in these trials developed persistently positive antibodies (positive test at more than 2 time points) and 30% developed transiently positive antibodies (positive at 1 or 2 post-baseline time points). The anti-brentuximab antibodies were directed against the antibody component of brentuximab vedotin in all patients with transiently or persistently positive antibodies. Two of the patients (1%) with persistently positive antibodies experienced adverse reactions consistent with infusion reactions that led to discontinuation of treatment. Overall, a higher incidence of infusion related reactions was observed in patients who developed persistently positive antibodies.



 A total of 58 patient samples that were either transiently or persistently positive for anti-brentuximab vedotin antibodies were tested for the presence of neutralizing antibodies. Sixty-two percent (62%) of these patients had at least one sample that was positive for the presence of neutralizing antibodies. The effect of anti-brentuximab vedotin antibodies on safety and efficacy is not known.

   5.1 Peripheral Neuropathy



  ADCETRIS treatment causes a peripheral neuropathy that is predominantly sensory. Cases of peripheral motor neuropathy have also been reported. ADCETRIS-induced peripheral neuropathy is cumulative.



 In studies of ADCETRIS as monotherapy, 62% of patients experienced any grade of neuropathy. The median time to onset of any grade was 3 months (range, 0-12). Of the patients who experienced neuropathy, 62% had complete resolution, 24% had partial improvement, and 14% had no improvement at the time of their last evaluation. The median time from onset to resolution or improvement of any grade was 5 months (range, 0-45). Of the patients who reported neuropathy, 38% had residual neuropathy at the time of their last evaluation [Grade 1 (27%), Grade 2 (9%), Grade 3 (2%)].



  In ECHELON-1 (Study 5), 67% of patients treated with ADCETRIS + AVD experienced any grade of neuropathy. The median time to onset of any grade was 2 months (range, 0-7), of Grade 2 was 3 months (range, 0-6) and of Grade 3 was 4 months (range, &lt;1-7). The median time from onset to resolution or improvement of any grade was 2 months (range, 0-32), of Grade 2 was 3 months (range, 0-28), and of Grade 3 was 4 months (range, 0-32). Of these patients, 43% had complete resolution, 24% had partial improvement (a decrease in severity by one or more grades from worst grade), and 33% had no improvement at the time of their last evaluation. Of the patients with residual neuropathy at the time of their last evaluation (57%), patients had Grade 1 (36%), Grade 2 (16%), Grade 3 (4%), or Grade 4 (&lt;1%) neuropathy.  



  In ECHELON-2 (Study 6), 52% of patients treated with ADCETRIS + CHP experienced new or worsening peripheral neuropathy of any grade (by maximum grade, 34% Grade 1, 15% Grade 2, 3% Grade 3, &lt; 1% Grade 4). The peripheral neuropathy was predominantly sensory (94% sensory, 16% motor) and had a median onset time of 2 months (range, &lt;1-5). At last evaluation, 50% had complete resolution of neuropathy, 12% had partial improvement, and 38% had no improvement. The median time to resolution or improvement overall was 4 months (range, 0-45). Of patients with residual neuropathy at their last evaluation, the neuropathy was Grade 1 in 72%, Grade 2 in 25%, and Grade 3 in 3%.  



 Monitor patients for symptoms of neuropathy, such as hypoesthesia, hyperesthesia, paresthesia, discomfort, a burning sensation, neuropathic pain, or weakness. Patients experiencing new or worsening peripheral neuropathy may require a delay, change in dose, or discontinuation of ADCETRIS [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  and     Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



    5.2 Anaphylaxis and Infusion Reactions



  Infusion-related reactions, including anaphylaxis, have occurred with ADCETRIS. Monitor patients during infusion. If anaphylaxis occurs, immediately and permanently discontinue administration of ADCETRIS and administer appropriate medical therapy. If an infusion-related reaction occurs, interrupt the infusion and institute appropriate medical management. Patients who have experienced a prior infusion-related reaction should be premedicated for subsequent infusions. Premedication may include acetaminophen, an antihistamine, and a corticosteroid.



    5.3 Hematologic Toxicities



  Fatal and serious cases of febrile neutropenia have been reported with ADCETRIS. Prolonged (&gt;=1 week) severe neutropenia and Grade 3 or Grade 4 thrombocytopenia or anemia can occur with ADCETRIS.



  Start primary prophylaxis with G-CSF beginning with Cycle 1 for patients who receive ADCETRIS in combination with chemotherapy for previously untreated Stage III or IV cHL or previously untreated PTCL [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .  



 Monitor complete blood counts prior to each dose of ADCETRIS. Monitor more frequently for patients with Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. Monitor patients for fever. If Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia develops, consider dose delays, reductions, discontinuation, or G-CSF prophylaxis with subsequent ADCETRIS doses [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2  ,  2.3)  ]  .



    5.4 Serious Infections and Opportunistic Infections



  Serious infections and opportunistic infections such as pneumonia, bacteremia, and sepsis or septic shock (including fatal outcomes) have been reported in patients treated with ADCETRIS. Monitor patients closely during treatment for the emergence of possible bacterial, fungal, or viral infections.



    5.5 Tumor Lysis Syndrome



  Patients with rapidly proliferating tumor and high tumor burden may be at increased risk of tumor lysis syndrome. Monitor closely and take appropriate measures.



    5.6 Increased Toxicity in the Presence of Severe Renal Impairment



  The frequency of &gt;=Grade 3 adverse reactions and deaths was greater in patients with severe renal impairment compared to patients with normal renal function. Due to higher MMAE exposure, &gt;=Grade 3 adverse reactions may be more frequent in patients with severe renal impairment compared to patients with normal renal function. Avoid the use of ADCETRIS in patients with severe renal impairment [creatinine clearance (CrCL) &lt;30 mL/min]  [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.6)     ].  



    5.7 Increased Toxicity in the Presence of Moderate or Severe Hepatic Impairment



  The frequency of &gt;=Grade 3 adverse reactions and deaths was greater in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment compared to patients with normal hepatic function. Avoid the use of ADCETRIS in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) or severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.7)  ]  .



    5.8 Hepatotoxicity



  Fatal and serious cases of hepatotoxicity have occurred in patients receiving ADCETRIS. Cases were consistent with hepatocellular injury, including elevations of transaminases and/or bilirubin. Cases have occurred after the first dose of ADCETRIS or after ADCETRIS rechallenge. Preexisting liver disease, elevated baseline liver enzymes, and concomitant medications may also increase the risk. Monitor liver enzymes and bilirubin. Patients experiencing new, worsening, or recurrent hepatotoxicity may require a delay, change in dose, or discontinuation of ADCETRIS.



    5.9 Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy



  Fatal cases of JC virus infection resulting in PML have been reported in ADCETRIS-treated patients. First onset of symptoms occurred at various times from initiation of ADCETRIS therapy, with some cases occurring within 3 months of initial exposure. In addition to ADCETRIS therapy, other possible contributory factors include prior therapies and underlying disease that may cause immunosuppression. Consider the diagnosis of PML in any patient presenting with new-onset signs and symptoms of central nervous system abnormalities. Hold ADCETRIS dosing for any suspected case of PML and discontinue ADCETRIS dosing if a diagnosis of PML is confirmed.



    5.10 Pulmonary Toxicity



  Fatal and serious events of noninfectious pulmonary toxicity including pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), have been reported. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pulmonary toxicity, including cough and dyspnea. In the event of new or worsening pulmonary symptoms, hold ADCETRIS dosing during evaluation and until symptomatic improvement.



    5.11 Serious Dermatologic Reactions



  Fatal and serious cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported with ADCETRIS. If SJS or TEN occurs, discontinue ADCETRIS and administer appropriate medical therapy.



    5.12 Gastrointestinal Complications



  Fatal and serious events of acute pancreatitis have been reported. Other fatal and serious gastrointestinal (GI) complications include perforation, hemorrhage, erosion, ulcer, intestinal obstruction, enterocolitis, neutropenic colitis, and ileus. Lymphoma with preexisting GI involvement may increase the risk of perforation. In the event of new or worsening GI symptoms, including severe abdominal pain, perform a prompt diagnostic evaluation and treat appropriately.



    5.13 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, ADCETRIS can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of ADCETRIS in pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, brentuximab vedotin caused embryo-fetal toxicities, including significantly decreased embryo viability, and fetal malformations at maternal exposures that were similar to the clinical dose of 1.8 mg/kg every three weeks.



 Advise females of reproductive potential to avoid pregnancy during ADCETRIS treatment and for at least 6 months after the final dose of ADCETRIS. Advise a pregnant woman of the potential risk to the fetus [see     Use in Specific Populations (8.1,        8.3)  ]  .
