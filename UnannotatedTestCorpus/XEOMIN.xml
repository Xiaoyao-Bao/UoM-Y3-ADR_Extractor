  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     Chronic Sialorrhea  



 Table 4 lists the adverse reactions that occurred in &gt;=3% of XEOMIN-treated patients in the double-blind, placebo-controlled phase of the study in patients with chronic sialorrhea  [see  Clinical Studies (14.1)  ]  . The most common adverse reactions (&gt;=4%) were tooth extraction, dry mouth, diarrhea, and hypertension. In the controlled portion of this study, 74 patients received 100 Units of XEOMIN and 36 patients received placebo. XEOMIN-treated patients were 21-80 years old (mean 65 years), and were predominantly male (71%) and white (99.5%).

             Upper Limb Spasticity  
 

 Table 5 lists the most common (&gt;=2%) adverse reactions following injection of XEOMIN in two placebo-controlled, Phase 3 studies in patients with upper limb spasticity. Study 1 and Study 2 were both double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, with an open-label extension  [see  Clinical Studies (14.2)  ]  . In the controlled portion of these studies, 283 patients received &gt;=120 Units to 400 Units, of which 217 patients received at least 400 units of XEOMIN, and 182 patients received placebo. XEOMIN-treated patients were 20-79 years old (mean 56 years), and were predominantly male (58%) and white (84%).

             Cervical Dystonia  
 

 The data described below reflect exposure to a single intramuscular dose of XEOMIN in a placebo-controlled, Phase 3 trial in patients with cervical dystonia [  see  Clinical Studies (14.3)    ]. In this study, 159 patients received XEOMIN (78 were randomized to receive a total dose of 120 Units, and 81 were randomized to receive a total dose of 240 Units). XEOMIN-treated patients were 18 to 79 years old (mean 53 years), and were predominantly female (66%) and Caucasian (91%). At study baseline, approximately 25% had mild, 50% had moderate, and 25% had severe cervical dystonia. Approximately 61% of XEOMIN-treated patients had previously received another botulinum toxin type A product. Common adverse events (&gt;=5% in any XEOMIN treatment group) observed in patients who received XEOMIN (120 Units or 240 Units) included dysphagia, neck pain, muscle weakness, injection site pain, and musculoskeletal pain.

              Blepharospasm  
 

 In the placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial in patients with blepharospasm previously treated with onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox)  [see  Clinical Studies (14.4)  ]  , 74 patients received XEOMIN at a mean dose of approximately 33 Units per eye (minimum 10 Units, maximum 50 Units). XEOMIN-treated patients were 22 to 79 years of age (mean 62 years), predominantly female (65%), Caucasian (79%), and had a mean time since diagnosis of approximately 5 years.



 The adverse events occurring in &gt;=5% of XEOMIN-treated patients and greater than placebo in the Phase 3 study were eyelid ptosis, dry eye, dry mouth, diarrhea, headache, visual impairment, dyspnea, nasopharyngitis, and respiratory tract infection. No serious adverse events occurred in patients who received XEOMIN; one placebo-treated patient experienced a serious adverse event (dyspnea).

             Glabellar Lines  
 

 In three placebo-controlled trials in 803 subjects with glabellar lines, 535 subjects received a single dose of 20 Units XEOMIN and 268 subjects received placebo. XEOMIN treated subjects were 24 to 74 years old, and were predominantly female (88%). The most frequent adverse reactions in XEOMIN treated subjects were: headache 29 (5.4%), facial paresis 4 (0.7%), injection site hematoma 3 (0.6%) and eyelid edema 2 (0.4%). Four serious adverse events occurred in two placebo-treated subjects. Six XEOMIN treated subjects experienced six serious adverse events. All serious adverse events were assessed as unrelated to study drug.



 The adverse reactions below reflect exposure to XEOMIN with glabellar lines in placebo-controlled studies. Adverse reactions are adverse events in which there is some basis to believe there is a causal relationship between the drug and the occurrence of the adverse event.



 Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

         In open label, multiple dose trials, adverse reactions were reported for 105 of the 800 subjects (13.1%). Headache was the most common adverse reaction, reported for 57 subjects (7.1%), followed by injection site hematoma in 8 subjects (1.0%). Adverse reactions reported in less than 1% of subjects were: facial paresis (brow ptosis), muscle disorder (elevation of eyebrow), injection site pain, and eyelid edema.
 

   6.2 Immunogenicity

  As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity.



 The incidence of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. In addition, the observed incidence of antibody positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies across products in this class may be misleading.



   6.3 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use of XEOMIN. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: eye swelling, eyelid edema, dysphagia, nausea, flu-like symptoms, injection site pain, injection site reaction, allergic dermatitis, localized allergic reactions like swelling, edema, erythema, pruritus or rash, herpes zoster, muscular weakness, muscle spasm, dysarthria, myalgia and hypersensitivity.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: DISTANT SPREAD OF TOXIN EFFECT

    WARNING: DISTANT SPREAD OF TOXIN EFFECT  

    Postmarketing reports indicate that the effects of XEOMIN and all botulinum toxin products may spread from the area of injection to produce symptoms consistent with botulinum toxin effects.  These may include asthenia, generalized muscle weakness, diplopia, blurred vision, ptosis, dysphagia, dysphonia, dysarthria, urinary incontinence and breathing difficulties.  These symptoms have been reported hours to weeks after injection.  Swallowing and breathing difficulties can be life threatening and there have been reports of death.  The risk of symptoms is probably greatest in children treated for spasticity but symptoms can also occur in adults treated for spasticity and other conditions, particularly in those patients who have underlying conditions that would predispose them to these symptoms.  In unapproved uses, including spasticity in children and in approved indications, cases of spread of effect have been reported at doses comparable to those used to treat cervical dystonia and at lower doses   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  .

   The effects of XEOMIN and all botulinum toxin products may spread from the area of injection to produce symptoms consistent with botulinum toxin effects. These symptoms have been reported hours to weeks after injection. Swallowing and breathing difficulties can be life threatening and there have been reports of death. The risk of symptoms is probably greatest in children treated for spasticity but symptoms can also occur in adults, particularly in those patients who have underlying conditions that would predispose them to these symptoms.   (  5.1  )

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Respiratory, speech, or swallowing difficulties: Increased risk if bilateral neck muscle injections are needed or with pre-existing muscular disorders; immediate medical attention may be required (  5.1  ,  5.3  ) 
 *  The potency Units of XEOMIN are not interchangeable with other preparations of botulinum toxin products (  5.2  ) 
 *  Corneal exposure and ulceration: protective measures may be required (  5.4  ) 
 *  Risk of ptosis: follow dosage recommendations (  5.5  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Spread of Toxin Effect



  Postmarketing safety data from XEOMIN and other approved botulinum toxins suggest that botulinum toxin effects may, in some cases, be observed beyond the site of local injection. The symptoms are consistent with the mechanism of action of botulinum toxin and may include asthenia, generalized muscle weakness, diplopia, blurred vision, ptosis, dysphagia, dysphonia, dysarthria, urinary incontinence, and breathing difficulties. These symptoms have been reported hours to weeks after injection. Swallowing and breathing difficulties can be life threatening and there have been reports of death related to the spread of toxin effects. The risk of symptoms is probably greatest in children treated for spasticity but symptoms can occur in adults treated for spasticity and other conditions, and particularly in those patients who have underlying conditions that would predispose them to these symptoms. In unapproved uses, including spasticity in children, and in approved indications, symptoms consistent with spread of toxin effect have been reported at doses comparable to or lower than doses used to treat cervical dystonia.



 Patients or caregivers should be advised to seek immediate medical care if swallowing, speech, or respiratory disorders occur.



    5.2 Lack of Interchangeability between Botulinum Toxin Products



  The potency Units of XEOMIN are specific to the preparation and assay method utilized. They are not interchangeable with the other preparations of botulinum toxin products and, therefore, Units of biological activity of XEOMIN cannot be compared to or converted into Units of any other botulinum toxin products assessed with any other specific assay method [see  Description (11)  ]  .



    5.3 Dysphagia and Breathing Difficulties



  Treatment with XEOMIN and other botulinum toxin products can result in swallowing or breathing difficulties. Patients with pre-existing swallowing or breathing difficulties may be more susceptible to these complications. In most cases, this is a consequence of weakening of muscles in the area of injection that are involved in breathing or swallowing. When distant effects occur, additional respiratory muscles may be involved [See  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  .



 Deaths as a complication of severe dysphagia have been reported after treatment with botulinum toxin. Dysphagia may persist for several months, and require use of a feeding tube to maintain adequate nutrition and hydration. Aspiration may result from severe dysphagia and is a particular risk when treating patients in whom swallowing or respiratory function is already compromised.



 Treatment of cervical dystonia with botulinum toxins may weaken neck muscles that serve as accessory muscles of ventilation. This may result in critical loss of breathing capacity in patients with respiratory disorders who may have become dependent upon these accessory muscles. There have been post-marketing reports of serious breathing difficulties, including respiratory failure, in patients with cervical dystonia treated with botulinum toxin products.



 Patients with smaller neck muscle mass and patients who require bilateral injections into the sternocleidomastoid muscles have been reported to be at greater risk of dysphagia. In general, limiting the dose injected into the sternocleidomastoid muscle may decrease the occurrence of dysphagia.



 Patients treated with botulinum toxin may require immediate medical attention should they develop problems with swallowing, speech or respiratory disorders. These reactions can occur within hours to weeks after injection with botulinum toxin [See  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



 Patients with neuromuscular disorders with peripheral motor neuropathic diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or neuromuscular junctional disorders (e.g., myasthenia gravis or Lambert-Eaton syndrome) may be at increased risk for severe dysphagia and respiratory compromise from typical doses of XEOMIN.



    5.4 Corneal Exposure, Corneal Ulceration, and Ectropion in Patients Treated for Blepharospasm



  Reduced blinking from injection of botulinum toxin products in the orbicularis muscle can lead to corneal exposure, persistent epithelial defect and corneal ulceration, especially in patients with VII nerve disorders. Careful testing of corneal sensation in eyes previously operated upon, avoidance of injection into the lower lid area to avoid ectropion, and vigorous treatment of any epithelial defect should be employed. This may require protective drops, ointment, therapeutic soft contact lenses, or closure of the eye by patching or other means. Because of its anticholinergic effects, XEOMIN should be used with caution in patients at risk of developing narrow angle glaucoma. To prevent ectropion, botulinum toxin products should not be injected into the medial lower eyelid area.



 Ecchymosis easily occurs in the soft tissues of the eyelid. Immediate gentle pressure at the injection site can limit that risk.



    5.5 Risk of Ptosis in Patients Treated for Glabellar Lines



  Do not exceed the recommended dosage and frequency of administration of XEOMIN.



 In order to reduce the complication of ptosis the following steps should be taken:



 *  Avoid injection near the levator palpebrae superioris, particularly in patients with larger brow depressor complexes. 
 *  Corrugator injections should be placed at least 1 cm above the bony supraorbital ridge. 
       5.6 Human Albumin and Transmission of Viral Diseases
 

  This product contains albumin, a derivative of human blood. Based on effective donor screening and product manufacturing processes, it carries an extremely remote risk for transmission of viral diseases. A theoretical risk for transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is also considered extremely remote. No cases of transmission of viral diseases or CJD have ever been reported for albumin.
