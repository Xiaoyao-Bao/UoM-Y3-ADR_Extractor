  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The safety of OsmoPrep was evaluated in two randomized, investigator-blinded, active controlled trials in 931 adult patients undergoing elective colonoscopy. The mean age of the study population was 60 years (range 20 to 89 years), 88% of patients were Caucasian and 55% were female  [see Clinical Studies (  14  )]  .



   Table 1  shows the most common adverse reactions reported in greater than 3% of patients by treatment group in Study 1  [see Clinical Studies (  14  )].  Since diarrhea was considered as a part of the efficacy of OsmoPrep, diarrhea was not defined as an adverse event in this clinical trial.

            Electrolyte Abnormalities in Study  1
 

   Hyperphosphatemia  



 A total of, 96%, 96%, and 93% of patients who took 60 grams of oral sodium phosphate, 60 grams of OsmoPrep, and 48 grams of OsmoPrep, respectively, developed hyperphosphatemia (defined as phosphate level &gt; 5.1 mg/dL) on the day of the colonoscopy. In this study, patients who took 60 grams of oral sodium phosphate, 60 grams of OsmoPrep, and 48 grams of OsmoPrep had baseline mean phosphate levels of 3.5, 3.5, and 3.6 mg/dL and subsequently developed mean phosphate levels of 7.6, 7.9, and 7.1 mg/dL, respectively, on the day of the colonoscopy.



   Hyperkalemia  



 A total of 20%, 22%, and 18% of patients who took 60 grams of oral sodium phosphate, 60 grams of OsmoPrep, and 48 grams of OsmoPrep, respectively, developed hypokalemia (defined as a potassium level &lt; 3.4 mEq/L) on the day of the colonoscopy. In this study, patients who took 60 grams of oral sodium phosphate, 60 grams of OsmoPrep, and 48 grams of OsmoPrep all had baseline potassium levels of about 4.3 mEq/L and then developed a mean potassium level of 3.7 mEq/L on the day of the colonoscopy.



 Several patients on all three sodium phosphate regimens developed hypocalcemia and hypernatremia that did not require treatment.



 The OsmoPrep 60-gram dosage regimen was associated with an increased risk of adverse reactions compared to the 48-gram dosage regimen and a similar overall response rate  [see Clinical Studies (  14  )]  . Therefore, the OsmoPrep 60-gram dosage is not a recommended regimen  [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  )].  



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of OsmoPrep. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Hypersensitivity reactions  : anaphylaxis, angioedema (swelling of the lips, tongue and face), rash, pruritus, urticaria, throat tightness, bronchospasm, dyspnea, pharyngeal edema, dysphagia, and paresthesia.



   Cardiovascular  : Arrhythmias



   Nervous system  : Seizures



   Renal  : Renal impairment, increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN), increased creatinine, acute renal failure, acute phosphate nephropathy, nephrocalcinosis, and renal tubular necrosis.

   5.1 Renal Disease, Acute Phosphate Nephropathy, and Electrolyte Disorders



   Renal Disease and Acute Phosphate Nephropathy  



 There have been rare, but serious, reports of renal failure, acute phosphate nephropathy, and nephrocalcinosis in patients



 who received oral sodium phosphate products, including OsmoPrep, for colon cleansing prior to colonoscopy. These cases



 often resulted in permanent impairment of renal function and several patients required long-term dialysis. The time to



 onset is typically within days; however, in some cases, the diagnosis of these events has been delayed up to several



 months after the ingestion of these products. Patients at increased risk of acute phosphate nephropathy may include



 patients with the following: hypovolemia, baseline kidney disease, increased age, and patients using medicines that affect



 renal perfusion or function [such as diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor



 blockers, and possibly nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [see Drug Interactions (  7.1  )]  .



  Electrolyte Disorders  



 Bowel preparations, including OsmoPrep can cause fluid and electrolyte disturbances, which can lead to serious adverse



 reactions including cardiac arrhythmias, seizures and renal impairment [see Adverse Reactions (  6.2  )]  .



  Patient Management  



 *    OsmoPrep is contraindicated in patients with a history of acute phosphate nephropathy [see Contraindications (  4  )]. Use OsmoPrep with caution in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/minute), with conditions, or who are taking medications, that increase the risk for fluid and electrolyte disturbances or may increase the risk of arrhythmias, seizures, or renal impairment. Consider performing baseline and post-colonoscopy labs (phosphate, calcium, potassium, sodium, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients [see Drug Interactions (  7.1  )] . 
 *    Correct electrolyte abnormalities such as hypernatremia, hyperphosphatemia, hypokalemia, or hypocalcemia 
    before treatment with OsmoPrep [see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  )]  .
 

 *    Avoid additional sodium phosphate-based purgative or enema products [see Drug Interactions (  7.1  )] . 
 *    Advise all patients to hydrate adequately before, during, and after the use of OsmoPrep [see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  ,  2.2  )] . 
 *    If a patient develops significant vomiting or signs of dehydration while or after taking OsmoPrep, consider 
    performing post-colonoscopy lab tests [electrolytes, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN)].
 

    5.2 Cardiac Arrhythmias



  There have been rare reports of serious arrhythmias associated with the use of ionic osmotic laxative products for bowel



 preparation. QT prolongation with sodium phosphate tablets has been associated with electrolyte imbalances, such as



 hypokalemia and hypocalcemia.



 Use caution when prescribing OsmoPrep for patients at increased risk of arrhythmias (e.g., patients with a history of



 prolonged QT, uncontrolled arrhythmias, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, or



 cardiomyopathy) and those taking medications known to prolong the QT interval, since serious complications may occur.



 Consider pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs s in patients at increased risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias.



    5.3 Seizures



  There have been rare reports of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and/or loss of consciousness associated with use of sodium phosphate osmotic laxative products, such as OsmoPrep, in patients with no prior history of seizures. The seizure cases were associated with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia) and low serum osmolality. The neurologic abnormalities resolved with correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities.



 Use OsmoPrep with caution in patients with a history of seizures and in patients at higher risk of seizure, such as patients taking medications that lower the seizure threshold (such as tricyclic antidepressants), patients withdrawing from alcohol or benzodiazepines, or patients with known or suspected hyponatremia [see Drug Interactions (  7.1  )].  



    5.4 Use in Patients with Significant Gastrointestinal Disease



  If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, perform appropriate diagnostic studies to rule out these conditions before administering OsmoPrep [see Contraindications (  4  )]  .



 Use with caution in patients with severe active ulcerative colitis.



    5.5 Colonic Mucosal Ulceration and Inflammatory Bowel Disease



  Osmotic laxatives, including OsmoPrep, may induce colonic mucosal aphthous ulcerations. In the OsmoPrep clinical program, aphthous ulcers were observed in 3% of patients who took the recommended OsmoPrep dosing regimen. Consider the potential for mucosal ulcerations resulting from bowel preparation when interpreting colonoscopic finding should in patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease.



 Use OsmoPrep with caution in patients experiencing an acute exacerbation of chronic inflammatory bowel disease as published data suggest that sodium phosphate absorption may be enhanced in such patients.



    5.6 Aspiration



  Patients with impaired gag reflex or other swallowing abnormalities are at risk for regurgitation or aspiration of OsmoPrep. Observed these patients during administration of OsmoPrep.



    5.7 Hypersensitivity Reactions



   OsmoPrep may cause serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, urticaria, and throat tightness [see Adverse Reactions (       6.2   )]     . Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis and instruct them to seek immediate medical care should signs and symptoms occur.
