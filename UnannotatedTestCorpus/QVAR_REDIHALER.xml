  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  A total of 1858 subjects participated in the QVAR REDIHALER clinical development program. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 Adults and Adolescent Patients 12 years of Age and Older: The adverse reaction information presented in Table 1 is derived from 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in which 1230 patients (751 female and 479 male adults previously treated with as-needed bronchodilators and/or inhaled corticosteroids) were treated with QVAR REDIHALER (doses of 40, 80, 160, or 320 mcg twice daily) or QVAR (beclomethasone dipropionate HFA) Inhalation Aerosol (QVAR MDI; doses of 160 or 320 mcg twice daily) or placebo. In considering these data, difference in average duration of exposure and clinical trial design should be taken into account.

 Other adverse reactions that occurred in clinical trials using QVAR REDIHALER with an incidence of 1% to 3% and which occurred at a greater incidence than placebo were influenza, gastroenteritis viral, ear infection, oral candidiasis, diarrhea, and myalgia.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  In addition to the adverse reactions reported from clinical trials with QVAR REDIHALER, the following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of QVAR MDI and other inhaled corticosteroids. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Local Effects:  Localized infections with  Candida albicans  have occurred in patients treated with beclomethasone dipropionate or other orally inhaled corticosteroids  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]  .



   Psychiatric and Behavioral Changes:  Aggression, depression, sleep disorders, psychomotor hyperactivity, and suicidal ideation have been reported (primarily in children).



   Eye Disorders:  Blurred vision, central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC).

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Localized infections: Candida albicans infection of the mouth and throat may occur. Monitor patients periodically for signs of adverse effects on the oral cavity. Advise patients to rinse the mouth with water without swallowing after inhalation to help reduce the risk. (   5.1   ) 
 *  Deterioration of asthma and acute episodes: Do not use QVAR REDIHALER for relief of acute symptoms. Patients require immediate re-evaluation during rapidly deteriorating asthma. (   5.2   ) 
 *  Transferring patients from systemic corticosteroids: Risk of impaired adrenal function when transferring from oral steroids. Taper patients slowly from systemic corticosteroids if transferring to QVAR REDIHALER. (  5.3  )  
 *  Immunosuppression: Potential worsening of existing tuberculosis, fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infection; or ocular herpes simplex infections. More serious or even fatal course of chickenpox or measles can occur in susceptible patients. Use with caution in patients with these infections because of the potential for worsening of these infections. (  5.4  )  
 *  Paradoxical bronchospasm: Bronchospasm, with an immediate increase in wheezing, may occur after dosing. Treat bronchospasm immediately with inhaled, short acting bronchodilator and discontinue QVAR REDIHALER. (  5.5  )  
 *  Hypersensitivity reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions, such as urticaria, angioedema, rash, and bronchospasm may occur. Discontinue QVAR REDIHALER if such reactions occur. (   5.6   ) 
 *  Hypercorticism and adrenal suppression: May occur with very high dosages or at the regular dosage in susceptible individuals. If such changes occur, discontinue QVAR REDIHALER slowly. (   5.7   ) 
 *  Effects on growth: Monitor growth of pediatric patients. (  5.8  )  
 *  Decreases in bone mineral density: Monitor patients with major risk factors for decreased bone mineral content. (   5.9   ) 
 *  Eye Disorders: Monitor patients with change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, blurred vision, glaucoma, and/or cataracts closely. (  5.10  )  
    
 

   5.1 Local Effects



  Localized infections with Candida albicans  have occurred in the mouth and pharynx in some patients receiving QVAR REDIHALER. If oropharyngeal candidiasis develops, it should be treated with appropriate local or systemic (i.e., oral) antifungal therapy while still continuing with QVAR REDIHALER therapy, but at times therapy with QVAR REDIHALER may need to be temporarily interrupted under close medical supervision. After inhalation, the patient should rinse his/her mouth with water without swallowing to help reduce the risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis.



    5.2 Deterioration of Asthma and Acute Episodes



  QVAR REDIHALER is not indicated for the relief of acute symptoms, i.e., as rescue therapy for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm. An inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist, not QVAR REDIHALER, should be used to relieve acute symptoms such as shortness of breath. Instruct patients to contact their physician immediately if episodes of asthma that are not responsive to bronchodilators occur during the course of treatment with QVAR REDIHALER. During such episodes, patients may require therapy with oral corticosteroids.



    5.3 Transferring Patients from Systemic Corticosteroid Therapy



  Particular care is needed in patients who are transferred from systemically active corticosteroids to QVAR REDIHALER because deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred in asthmatic patients during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to less systemically available inhaled corticosteroids. After withdrawal from systemic corticosteroids, a number of months are required for recovery of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function.



 Patients who have been previously maintained on 20 mg or more per day of prednisone (or its equivalent) may be most susceptible, particularly when their systemic corticosteroids have been almost completely withdrawn. During this period of HPA suppression, patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to trauma, surgery, or infections (particularly gastroenteritis) or other conditions with severe electrolyte loss. Although QVAR REDIHALER may provide control of asthmatic symptoms during these episodes, in recommended doses it supplies less than normal physiological amounts of glucocorticoid systemically and does NOT provide the mineralocorticoid that is necessary for coping with these emergencies.



 During periods of stress or a severe asthmatic attack, patients who have been withdrawn from systemic corticosteroids should be instructed to resume oral corticosteroids (in large doses) immediately and to contact their physician for further instruction. These patients should also be instructed to carry a warning card indicating that they may need supplementary systemic steroids during periods of stress or a severe asthma attack.



 Patients requiring oral or other systemic corticosteroids should be weaned slowly from oral or other systemic corticosteroid use after transferring to QVAR REDIHALER. Lung function (FEV1or PEF), beta-agonist use, and asthma symptoms should be carefully monitored during withdrawal of oral or other systemic corticosteroids. In addition to monitoring asthma signs and symptoms, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency such as fatigue, lassitude, weakness, nausea and vomiting, and hypotension.



 Transfer of patients from systemic corticosteroid therapy to QVAR REDIHALER may unmask allergic conditions previously suppressed by the systemic corticosteroid therapy, e.g., rhinitis, conjunctivitis, eczema, arthritis, and eosinophilic conditions.



 During withdrawal from oral corticosteroids, some patients may experience symptoms of systemically active corticosteroid withdrawal, e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, and depression, despite maintenance or even improvement of respiratory function.



    5.4 Immunosuppression



  Persons who are on drugs which suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in non-immune patients on corticosteroids. In such patients who have not had these diseases or been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. It is not known how the dose, route and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection, and nor is the contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment known. If exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella-zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.



 Inhaled corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculosis infection of the respiratory tract; untreated systemic fungal, bacterial, parasitic or viral infections; or ocular herpes simplex.



    5.5 Paradoxical Bronchospasm



  Inhaled corticosteroids may produce inhalation-induced bronchospasm with an immediate increase in wheezing after dosing that may be life-threatening. If inhalation induced bronchospasm occurs following dosing with QVAR REDIHALER, it should be treated immediately with an inhaled, short-acting bronchodilator. Treatment with QVAR REDIHALER should be discontinued and alternate therapy instituted.



    5.6 Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions



  Hypersensitivity reactions, such as urticaria, angioedema, rash, and bronchospasm, may occur after administration of QVAR REDIHALER. Discontinue QVAR REDIHALER if such reactions occur [see Contraindications (  4.2  )]  .



    5.7 Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression



  QVAR REDIHALER will often help control asthma symptoms with less suppression of HPA function than therapeutically equivalent oral doses of prednisone. Since beclomethasone dipropionate is absorbed into the circulation and can be systemically active at higher doses, the beneficial effects of QVAR REDIHALER in minimizing HPA dysfunction may be expected only when recommended dosages are not exceeded and individual patients are titrated to the lowest effective dose.



 Because of the possibility of systemic absorption of inhaled corticosteroids, patients treated with QVAR REDIHALER should be observed carefully for any evidence of systemic corticosteroid effects. Particular care should be taken in observing patients postoperatively or during periods of stress for evidence of inadequate adrenal response.



 It is possible that systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression (including adrenal crisis) may appear in a small number of patients, particularly when beclomethasone dipropionate is administered at higher than recommended doses over prolonged periods of time. If such effects occur, the dosage of QVAR REDIHALER should be reduced slowly, consistent with accepted procedures for reducing systemic corticosteroids and for management of asthma symptoms.



    5.8 Effects on Growth



  Orally inhaled corticosteroids, including QVAR REDIHALER, may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. Monitor the growth of pediatric patients receiving QVAR REDIHALER routinely (e.g., via stadiometry). To minimize the systemic effects of orally inhaled corticosteroids, including QVAR REDIHALER, titrate each patient's dose to the lowest dosage that effectively controls his/her symptoms [see Use in Specific Populations   (  8.4  )]  .



    5.9 Reduction in Bone Mineral Density



  Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) have been observed with long-term administration of products containing inhaled corticosteroids. The clinical significance of small changes in BMD with regard to long-term outcomes, such as fracture, is unknown. Patients with major risk factors for decreased bone mineral content, such as prolonged immobilization, family history of osteoporosis, or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass (e.g., anticonvulsants and corticosteroids) should be monitored and treated with established standards of care.



    5.10 Eye Disorders



  Glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, blurred vision and cataracts have been reported following the use of long term administration of inhaled corticosteroids. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, blurred vision, glaucoma, and/or cataracts while using QVAR REDIHALER.
