  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The data below reflect exposure to Elitek in 265 pediatric and 82 adult patients enrolled in one active-controlled trial (Study 1), two uncontrolled trials (Studies 2 and 3), and an uncontrolled safety trial (n=82). Additional data were obtained from an expanded access program of 356 patients, for whom data collection was limited to serious adverse reactions. Among these 703 patients 63% were male, the median age was 10 years (range 10 days to 88 years), 73% were Caucasian, 9% African, 4% Asian, and 14% other/unknown.



 Among the 347 patients for whom all adverse reactions regardless of severity were assessed, the most frequently observed adverse reactions (incidence &gt;=10%) were vomiting (50%), fever (46%), nausea (27%), headache (26%), abdominal pain (20%), constipation (20%), diarrhea (20%), mucositis (15%), and rash (13%). In Study 1, an active control study, the following adverse reactions occurred more frequently in Elitek-treated subjects than allopurinol-treated subjects: vomiting, fever, nausea, diarrhea, and headache. Although the incidence of rash was similar in the two arms, severe rash was reported only in one Elitek-treated patient.



 Further studies, including one-active controlled study (Study 4) and four supportive studies, have been conducted in adult patients. In these studies, Elitek was administered to a total of 434 adult patients (58% male, 42% female; median age 56 years [range 18 years to 89 years]; 52% Caucasian, 7% African, 14% Asian, 28% other/unknown).



 Of these 434 patients, 275 adult patients with leukemia, lymphoma, or solid tumor malignancies at risk for hyperuricemia and tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) were randomized in an open label trial receiving either Elitek alone, Elitek in combination with allopurinol, or allopurinol alone (Study 4).



 A drug-related adverse reaction in Study 4 of any grade was experienced in 4.3% of Elitek-treated patients, 5.4% of Elitek/allopurinol-treated patients, and 1.1% of allopurinol-treated patients.



 Table 1 presents the per-patient incidence of adverse reactions by study arm in Study 4.

             Hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 4.3% of Elitek-treated patients and 1.1% of Elitek/allopurinol-treated patients in Study 4. Clinical manifestations of hypersensitivity included arthralgia, injection site irritation, peripheral edema, and rash.
 

 The following serious adverse reactions occurred at a difference in incidence of &gt;=2% in patients receiving Elitek compared to patients receiving allopurinol in randomized studies (Study 1 and Study 4): pulmonary hemorrhage, respiratory failure, supraventricular arrhythmias, ischemic coronary artery disorders, and abdominal and gastrointestinal infections.



 The incidence of anaphylaxis, hemolysis, and methemoglobinemia was less than 1% of the 887 Elitek-treated patients entered on these clinical trials.



   6.2 Immunogenicity

  As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. Elitek can elicit anti-product antibodies that bind to rasburicase and in some instances inhibit the activity of rasburicase  in vitro  [  see  Boxed Warning  ,  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)    ].



 In clinical trials of pediatric patients with hematologic malignancies, 24/218 patients tested (11%) developed antibodies by day 28 following Elitek administration as assessed by qualitative ELISA.



 Using quasi-quantitative immunoassays in rasburicase naive adult patients with hematological malignancies, 47/260 (18%) patients were positive for anti-rasburicase immunoglobulin G (IgG), 21/260 (8%) patients were positive for anti-rasburicase neutralizing IgG, and 16/260 (6%) patients were positive for anti-rasburicase immunoglobulin E (IgE) from day 14 to 24 months after 5 daily doses of Elitek.



 The incidence of antibody responses detected is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay, which have not been fully evaluated. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including serum sampling, timing and methodology, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to Elitek with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.



   6.3 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified from clinical trials and/or postmarketing surveillance. Because they are reported from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 Central nervous system disorders: convulsion, muscle contractions involuntary



 Immune system disorders: Cases of anaphylaxis with potential fatal outcome have been reported.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS, HEMOLYSIS, METHEMOGLOBINEMIA, AND INTERFERENCE WITH URIC ACID MEASUREMENTS

    WARNING: HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS, HEMOLYSIS, METHEMOGLOBINEMIA, AND INTERFERENCE WITH URIC ACID MEASUREMENTS  

  EXCERPT:     WARNING: HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS, HEMOLYSIS, METHEMOGLOBINEMIA, AND INTERFERENCE WITH URIC ACID MEASUREMENTS  



     See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning      .  



 *  Hypersensitivity Reactions: Elitek can cause serious and fatal hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis. Immediately and permanently discontinue Elitek if a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs (4, 5.1, 6.2). 
 *  Hemolysis: Do not administer Elitek to patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Immediately and permanently discontinue Elitek if hemolysis occurs. Screen patients at higher risk for G6PD deficiency (e.g., patients of African or Mediterranean ancestry) prior to starting Elitek therapy (4, 5.2). 
 *  Methemoglobinemia: Elitek can result in methemoglobinemia in some patients. Immediately and permanently discontinue Elitek if methemoglobinemia occurs (4, 5.3). 
 *  Interference with uric acid measurements: Elitek enzymatically degrades uric acid in blood samples left at room temperature. Collect blood samples in pre-chilled tubes containing heparin and immediately immerse and maintain sample in an ice water bath. Assay plasma samples within 4 hours of collection (5.4). 
    
 

    Hypersensitivity Reactions  



   Elitek  (r)   can cause serious and fatal hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis. Immediately and permanently discontinue Elitek in patients who experience a serious hypersensitivity reaction [  see   Contraindications (4)  ,   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ,   Adverse Reactions (6.2)    ].  



     Hemolysis  



   Do not administer Elitek to patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Immediately and permanently discontinue Elitek in patients developing hemolysis. Screen patients at higher risk for G6PD deficiency (e.g., patients of African or Mediterranean ancestry) prior to starting Elitek [  see   Contraindications (4)  ,   Warnings and Precautions (5.2)    ].  



     Methemoglobinemia  



   Elitek can result in methemoglobinemia in some patients. Immediately and permanently discontinue Elitek in patients developing methemoglobinemia [  see   Contraindications (4)  ,   Warnings and Precautions (5.3)    ].  



     Interference with Uric Acid Measurements  



   Elitek enzymatically degrades uric acid in blood samples left at room temperature. Collect blood samples in pre-chilled tubes containing heparin and immediately immerse and maintain sample in an ice water bath. Assay plasma samples within 4 hours of collection [  see   Warnings and Precautions (5.4)    ].

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions



  Elitek can cause serious and fatal hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis. In clinical studies, anaphylaxis was reported in &lt;1% patients receiving Elitek. This can occur at any time during treatment including the first dose. Signs and symptoms of these reactions include bronchospasm, chest pain and tightness, dyspnea, hypoxia, hypotension, shock, and urticaria. Immediately and permanently discontinue Elitek administration in any patient developing clinical evidence of a serious hypersensitivity reaction [ see  Boxed Warning  ,  Contraindications (4)  ,  Adverse Reactions (6.2)    ].



 The safety and efficacy of Elitek have been established only for a single course of treatment once daily for 5 days.



    5.2 Hemolysis



  Elitek is contraindicated in patients with G6PD deficiency because hydrogen peroxide is one of the major by-products of the conversion of uric acid to allantoin. In clinical studies, hemolysis occurs in &lt;1% patients receiving Elitek; severe hemolytic reactions occurred within 2-4 days of the start of Elitek. Immediately and permanently discontinue Elitek administration in any patient developing hemolysis. Institute appropriate patient monitoring and support measures (e.g., transfusion support). Screen patients at higher risk for G6PD deficiency (e.g., patients of African or Mediterranean ancestry) prior to starting Elitek [ see  Boxed Warning  ,  Contraindications (4)    ].



    5.3 Methemoglobinemia



  In clinical studies, methemoglobinemia occurred in &lt;1% patients receiving Elitek. These included cases of serious hypoxemia requiring intervention with medical support measures. It is not known whether patients with deficiency of cytochrome b5reductase (formerly known as methemoglobin reductase) or of other enzymes with antioxidant activity are at increased risk for methemoglobinemia or hemolytic anemia. Immediately and permanently discontinue Elitek administration in any patient identified as having developed methemoglobinemia. Institute appropriate monitoring and support measures (e.g., transfusion support, methylene-blue administration) [ see  Boxed Warning  ,  Contraindications (4)    ].



    5.4 Laboratory Test Interference



  At room temperature, Elitek causes enzymatic degradation of the uric acid in blood/plasma/serum samples potentially resulting in spuriously low plasma uric acid assay readings. Special sample handling procedure must be followed to avoid ex vivo  uric acid degradation [ see  Boxed Warning  ,  Drug Interactions (7)    ].
