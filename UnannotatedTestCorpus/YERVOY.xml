  The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling.

 *    Immune-mediated enterocolitis [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ] . 
 *    Immune-mediated hepatitis [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ] . 
 *    Immune-mediated dermatitis [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ] . 
 *    Immune-mediated neuropathies [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.4)  ] . 
 *    Immune-mediated endocrinopathies [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.5)  ] . 
 *    Other immune-mediated adverse reactions, including ocular manifestations [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.6)  ] . 
    In patients receiving YERVOY 3 mg/kg for unresectable or metastatic melanoma in Trial 1, 15% of patients receiving monotherapy and 12% of patients treated in combination with gp100 peptide vaccine experienced Grade 3 to 5 immune-mediated reactions. In patients receiving YERVOY 10 mg/kg for adjuvant treatment of melanoma in Trial 2, 41% experienced Grade 3 to 5 immune-mediated reactions.
 

   EXCERPT:   Most common adverse reactions (&gt;=5%) are fatigue, diarrhea, pruritus, rash, and colitis. Additional common adverse reactions at the 10 mg/kg dose (&gt;=5%) include nausea, vomiting, headache, weight loss, pyrexia, decreased appetite, and insomnia.  (6.1)

  6.1   Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed cannot be directly compared with rates in other clinical trials or experience with therapeutics in the same class and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

 The data described below reflect exposure to YERVOY 3 mg/kg in Trial 1, a randomized trial in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and to YERVOY 10 mg/kg in Trial 2, a randomized trial in patients with resected Stage IIIA (&gt;1 mm nodal involvement), IIIB, and IIIC (with no in-transit metastases) cutaneous melanoma.

 Clinically significant adverse reactions were evaluated in a total of 982 patients treated in Trials 1 and 2 and in 21 dose-ranging trials (n=2478) administering YERVOY at doses of 0.1 to 20 mg/kg  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.6)  ]  .

   Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma

  The safety of YERVOY was evaluated in Trial 1, a randomized, double-blind clinical trial in which 643 previously treated patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma received YERVOY 3 mg/kg for 4 doses given by intravenous infusion as a single agent (n=131), YERVOY with an investigational gp100 peptide vaccine (gp100) (n=380), or gp100 peptide vaccine as a single agent (n=132)  [see  Clinical Studies (14.1)  ]  . Patients in the trial received a median of 4 doses (range: 1 to 4 doses).

 Trial 1 excluded patients with active autoimmune disease or those receiving systemic immunosuppression for organ transplantation.

 The trial population characteristics were: median age 57 years (range: 19 to 90), 59% male, 94% white, and baseline ECOG performance status 0 (56%).

 YERVOY was discontinued for adverse reactions in 10% of patients.

 Table 2 presents selected adverse reactions from Trial 1, which occurred in at least 5% of patients in the YERVOY-containing arms and with at least 5% increased incidence over the control gp100 arm for all-grade events and at least 1% incidence over the control group for Grade 3 to 5 events.

   The safety of YERVOY was evaluated in Trial 2, a randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which 945 patients with resected Stage IIIA (&gt;1 mm nodal involvement), IIIB, and IIIC (with no in-transit metastases) cutaneous melanoma received YERVOY 10 mg/kg (n=471) or placebo (n=474) administered as an intravenous infusion for 4 doses every 3 weeks followed by 10 mg/kg every 12 weeks beginning at Week 24 up to a maximum of 3 years  [see  Clinical Studies (14.2)  ]  . In this trial, 36% of patients received YERVOY for longer than 6 months and 26% of patients received YERVOY for longer than 1 year. YERVOY-treated patients in the trial received a median of 4 doses (range: 1 to 16).

 Trial 2 excluded patients with prior systemic therapy for melanoma, autoimmune disease, a condition requiring systemic immunosuppression, or a positive test for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV.

 The trial population characteristics were: median age 51 years (range: 18 to 84 years), 62% male, 99% white, and baseline ECOG performance status 0 (94%).

 YERVOY was discontinued for adverse reactions in 52% of patients.

 Table 4 presents selected adverse reactions from Trial 2 which occurred in at least 5% of YERVOY-treated patients and with at least 5% increased incidence over the placebo group for all-grade events.

          Other Clinical Experience
   Across clinical studies that utilized YERVOY doses ranging from 0.3 to 10 mg/kg, the following adverse reactions were also reported (incidence less than 1% unless otherwise noted): urticaria (2%), large intestinal ulcer, esophagitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, renal failure, and infusion reaction.

   6.2   Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of YERVOY. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

   Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders:  Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS syndrome)

   6.3   Immunogenicity

  As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity.

 Eleven (1.1%) of 1024 evaluable patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma tested positive for treatment-emergent binding antibodies against ipilimumab (TE-ADAs) in an electrochemiluminescent (ECL) based assay. This assay had substantial limitations in detecting anti-ipilimumab antibodies in the presence of ipilimumab. Seven (4.9%) of 144 patients receiving ipilimumab and 7 (4.5%) of 156 patients receiving placebo for the adjuvant treatment of melanoma tested positive for TE-ADAs using an ECL assay with improved drug tolerance. No patients tested positive for neutralizing antibodies. No infusion-related reactions occurred in patients who tested positive for TE-ADAs.

 Immunogenicity assay results are highly dependent on several factors including assay sensitivity and specificity, assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of incidence of antibodies to ipilimumab with the incidences of antibodies to other products may be misleading.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: IMMUNE-MEDIATED ADVERSE REACTIONS

  WARNING: IMMUNE-MEDIATED ADVERSE REACTIONS

    YERVOY can result in severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions. These immune-mediated reactions may involve any organ system; however, the most common severe immune-mediated adverse reactions are enterocolitis, hepatitis, dermatitis (including toxic epidermal necrolysis), neuropathy, and endocrinopathy. The majority of these immune-mediated reactions initially manifested during treatment; however, a minority occurred weeks to months after discontinuation of YERVOY.  

   Permanently discontinue YERVOY and initiate systemic high-dose corticosteroid therapy for severe immune-mediated reactions   [see           Dosage and Administration (2.3)          ]  .  

   Assess patients for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis, dermatitis, neuropathy, and endocrinopathy, and evaluate clinical chemistries including liver function tests, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level, and thyroid function tests, at baseline and before each dose   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1  ,   5.2  ,   5.3  ,   5.4  ,   5.5)  ]  .

   5.1   Immune-Mediated Enterocolitis

  Immune-mediated enterocolitis, including fatal cases, can occur with YERVOY.

 Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, mucus or blood in stool, with or without fever) and of bowel perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus). In symptomatic patients, rule out infectious etiologies and consider endoscopic evaluation for persistent or severe symptoms.

 Permanently discontinue YERVOY in patients with severe enterocolitis and initiate systemic corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. In clinical trials, rapid corticosteroid tapering resulted in recurrence or worsening symptoms of enterocolitis in some patients. Consider adding anti-TNF or other immunosuppressant agents for management of immune-mediated enterocolitis unresponsive to systemic corticosteroids within 3 to 5 days or recurring after symptom improvement.

 Withhold YERVOY dosing for moderate enterocolitis; administer anti-diarrheal treatment and, if persistent for more than 1 week, initiate systemic corticosteroids at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .

    Metastatic Melanoma

  In patients receiving YERVOY 3 mg/kg in Trial 1, severe, life-threatening, or fatal (diarrhea of 7 or more stools above baseline, fever, ileus, peritoneal signs; Grade 3 to 5) immune-mediated enterocolitis occurred in 34 YERVOY-treated patients (7%), and moderate (diarrhea with up to 6 stools above baseline, abdominal pain, mucus or blood in stool; Grade 2) enterocolitis occurred in 28 YERVOY-treated patients (5%). Across all YERVOY-treated patients (n=511), 5 patients (1%) developed intestinal perforation, 4 patients (0.8%) died as a result of complications, and 26 patients (5%) were hospitalized for severe enterocolitis.

 The median time to onset of Grade 3 to 5 enterocolitis was 1.7 months (range: 11 days to 3.1 months) and for Grade 2 enterocolitis was 1.4 months (range: 2 days to 4.3 months).

 Twenty-nine patients (85%) with Grade 3 to 5 enterocolitis were treated with high-dose (&gt;=40 mg prednisone equivalent per day) corticosteroids, with a median dose of 80 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent; the median duration of treatment was 16 days (ranging up to 3.2 months) followed by corticosteroid taper. Of the 28 patients with moderate enterocolitis, 46% were not treated with systemic corticosteroids, 29% were treated with &lt;40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day for a median duration of 1.2 months, and 25% were treated with high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days prior to corticosteroid taper. Infliximab was administered to 5 (8%) of the 62 patients with moderate, severe, or life-threatening immune-mediated enterocolitis following inadequate response to corticosteroids.

 Of the 34 patients with Grade 3 to 5 enterocolitis, 74% experienced complete resolution, 3% experienced improvement to Grade 2 severity, and 24% did not improve. Among the 28 patients with Grade 2 enterocolitis, 79% experienced complete resolution, 11% improved, and 11% did not improve.

    Adjuvant Treatment of Melanoma

  In patients receiving YERVOY 10 mg/kg in Trial 2, Grade 3 to 5 immune-mediated enterocolitis occurred in 76 patients (16%) and Grade 2 enterocolitis occurred in 68 patients (14%). Seven patients (1.5%) developed intestinal perforation and 3 patients (0.6%) died as a result of complications [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .

 The median time to onset for Grade 3 to 4 enterocolitis was 1.1 months (range: 1 day to 33.1 months) and for Grade 2 enterocolitis was 1.1 months (range: 1 day to 20.6 months).

 Seventy-one patients (95%) with Grade 3 to 4 enterocolitis were treated with systemic corticosteroids. The median duration of treatment was 4.7 months (ranging up to 52.3 months).

 Of the 68 patients with moderate enterocolitis, 51 patients (75%) were treated with systemic corticosteroids with a median duration of treatment of 3.5 months (ranging up to 52.2 months). Non-corticosteroids immunosuppression, consisting almost exclusively of infliximab, was used to treat 36% of patients with Grade 3 to 4 enterocolitis and 15% of patients with a Grade 2 event.

 Of the 75 patients with Grade 3 to 4 immune-mediated enterocolitis, 86% experienced complete resolution, 3% experienced improvement to Grade 1, and 11% did not improve. Among the 68 patients with Grade 2 enterocolitis, 94% experienced complete resolution, 3% experienced improvement to Grade 1, and 3% did not improve.

    5.2   Immune-Mediated Hepatitis

  Immune-mediated hepatitis, including fatal cases, can occur with YERVOY.

 Monitor liver function tests (hepatic transaminase and bilirubin levels) and assess patients for signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity before each dose of YERVOY. In patients with hepatotoxicity, rule out infectious or malignant causes and increase frequency of liver function test monitoring until resolution.

 Permanently discontinue YERVOY in patients with Grade 3 to 4 hepatotoxicity and administer systemic corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent. When liver function tests show sustained improvement or return to baseline, initiate corticosteroid tapering and continue to taper over 1 month. Across the clinical development program for YERVOY, mycophenolate treatment has been administered in patients who have persistent severe hepatitis despite high-dose corticosteroids. Withhold YERVOY in patients with Grade 2 hepatotoxicity [see     Dosage and Administration (2.3)     ]  .

    Metastatic Melanoma

  In patients receiving YERVOY 3 mg/kg in Trial 1, severe, life-threatening, or fatal hepatotoxicity (AST or ALT elevations of more than 5 times the upper limit of normal or total bilirubin elevations more than 3 times the upper limit of normal; Grade 3 to 5) occurred in 8 YERVOY-treated patients (2%) ,  with fatal hepatic failure in 0.2% and hospitalization in 0.4% of YERVOY-treated patients. An additional 13 patients (2.5%) experienced moderate hepatotoxicity manifested by liver function test abnormalities (AST or ALT elevations of more than 2.5 times but not more than 5 times the upper limit of normal or total bilirubin elevation of more than 1.5 times but not more than 3 times the upper limit of normal; Grade 2). The underlying pathology was not ascertained in all patients but in some instances included immune-mediated hepatitis. There were insufficient numbers of patients with biopsy-proven hepatitis to characterize the clinical course of this event.

    Adjuvant Treatment of Melanoma

  In patients receiving YERVOY 10 mg/kg in Trial 2, Grade 3 to 4 immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 51 patients (11%) and moderate Grade 2 immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 22 patients (5%). Liver biopsy performed in 6 patients with Grade 3 to 4 hepatitis showed evidence of toxic or autoimmune hepatitis. The median time to onset for Grade 3 to 4 hepatitis was 2.0 months (range: 1 day to 4.2 months) and for Grade 2 hepatitis was 1.4 months (range: 13 days to 6.5 months). Of the 51 patients with Grade 3 to 4 immune-mediated hepatitis, 94% experienced complete resolution, 4% experienced improvement to Grade 1, and 2% did not improve. Of the 22 patients with Grade 2 immune-mediated hepatitis, 91% experienced complete resolution and 9% did not improve.

 Forty-six patients (90%) with Grade 3 to 4 hepatitis were treated with systemic corticosteroids. The median duration of treatment was 4.4 months (ranging up to 56.1 months). Sixteen patients (73%) with moderate hepatitis were treated with systemic corticosteroids. The median duration of treatment was 2.6 months (ranging up to 41.4 months).

    Concurrent Administration with Vemurafenib

  In a dose-finding trial, Grade 3 increases in transaminases with or without concomitant increases in total bilirubin occurred in 6 of 10 patients who received concurrent YERVOY (3 mg/kg) and vemurafenib (960 mg BID or 720 mg BID).

    5.3   Immune-Mediated Dermatitis

  Immune-mediated dermatitis, including fatal cases, can occur with YERVOY.

 Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of dermatitis, such as rash and pruritus. Unless an alternate etiology has been identified, signs or symptoms of dermatitis should be considered immune-mediated.

 Permanently discontinue YERVOY in patients with Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, or rash complicated by full thickness dermal ulceration, or necrotic, bullous, or hemorrhagic manifestations. Administer systemic corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent. When dermatitis is controlled, corticosteroid tapering should occur over a period of at least 1 month. Withhold YERVOY dosing in patients with moderate to severe signs and symptoms [see     Dosage and Administration (2.3)     ]  .

 For mild to moderate dermatitis, such as localized rash and pruritus, treat symptomatically. Administer topical or systemic corticosteroids if there is no improvement of symptoms within 1 week.

    Metastatic Melanoma

  In patients receiving YERVOY 3 mg/kg in Trial 1, severe, life-threatening, or fatal immune-mediated dermatitis (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, or rash complicated by full thickness dermal ulceration, or necrotic, bullous, or hemorrhagic manifestations; Grade 3 to 5) occurred in 13 YERVOY-treated patients (2.5%). One patient (0.2%) died as a result of toxic epidermal necrolysis and one additional patient required hospitalization for severe dermatitis. There were 63 patients (12%) with moderate (Grade 2) dermatitis.

 The median time to onset of moderate, severe, or life-threatening immune-mediated dermatitis was 22 days and ranged up to 4.0 months from the initiation of YERVOY.

 Seven YERVOY-treated patients (54%) with severe dermatitis received high-dose corticosteroids (median dose 60 mg prednisone/day or equivalent) for up to 3.4 months followed by corticosteroid taper. Of these 7 patients, 6 had complete resolution; time to resolution ranged up to 3.6 months.

 Of the 63 patients with moderate dermatitis, 25 (40%) were treated with systemic corticosteroids (median of 60 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent) for a median of 15 days, 7 (11%) were treated with only topical corticosteroids, and 31 (49%) did not receive systemic or topical corticosteroids. Forty-four patients (70%) with moderate dermatitis were reported to have complete resolution, 7 (11%) improved to mild (Grade 1) severity, and 12 (19%) had no reported improvement.

    Adjuvant Treatment of Melanoma

  In patients receiving YERVOY 10 mg/kg in Trial 2, Grade 3 to 4 immune-mediated dermatitis occurred in 19 patients (4%). There were 99 patients (21%) with moderate (Grade 2) dermatitis. The median time to onset for Grade 3 to 4 dermatitis was 14 days (range: 5 days to 11.3 months) and for Grade 2 dermatitis was 11 days (range: 1 day to 16.6 months).

 Sixteen patients (84%) with Grade 3 to 4 dermatitis were treated with systemic corticosteroids for a median of 21 days (ranging up to 49.2 months) resulting in complete resolution of dermatitis within a median time of 4.3 months (range up to 44.4 months). Of the 3 patients (16%) not treated with systemic or topical corticosteroids, 2 (11%) had complete resolution and 1 had improvement to Grade 1.

 Of the 99 patients with Grade 2 dermatitis, 67 (68%) were treated with systemic corticosteroids for a median of 2.6 months, 16 (16%) were treated with only topical corticosteroids and 16 (16%) did not receive systemic or topical corticosteroids. Seventy-seven patients (78%) had complete resolution, 15 (15%) improved to mild (Grade 1) severity, and 7 (7%) did not improve.

    5.4   Immune-Mediated Neuropathies

  Immune-mediated neuropathies, including fatal cases, can occur with YERVOY.

 Monitor for symptoms of motor or sensory neuropathy such as unilateral or bilateral weakness, sensory alterations, or paresthesia. Permanently discontinue YERVOY in patients with severe neuropathy (interfering with daily activities) such as Guillain-Barre-like syndromes. Institute medical intervention as appropriate for management of severe neuropathy. Consider initiation of systemic corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent for severe neuropathies. Withhold YERVOY dosing in patients with moderate neuropathy (not interfering with daily activities) [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .

    Metastatic Melanoma

  In patients receiving YERVOY 3 mg/kg in Trial 1, 1 case of fatal Guillain-Barre syndrome and 1 case of severe (Grade 3) peripheral motor neuropathy were reported. Across the clinical development program of YERVOY, myasthenia gravis and additional cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome have been reported.

    Adjuvant Treatment of Melanoma

  In patients receiving YERVOY 10 mg/kg in Trial 2, Grade 3 to 5 immune-mediated neuropathy occurred in 8 patients (2%); the sole fatality was due to complications of Guillain-Barre syndrome [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Moderate Grade 2 immune-mediated neuropathy occurred in 1 patient (0.2%).

 The time to onset across the 9 patients with Grade 2 to 5 immune-mediated neuropathy ranged from 1.4 to 27.4 months. All 8 patients with Grade 3 to 5 neuropathy were treated with systemic corticosteroids (range: 3 days to 38.3 months) and 3 also received tacrolimus. Four of the 8 patients with Grade 3 to 5 immune-mediated neuropathy experienced complete resolution, 1 improved to Grade 1, and 3 did not improve. The single patient with Grade 2 immune-mediated neuropathy experienced complete resolution without the use of corticosteroids.

    5.5   Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies

  Immune-mediated endocrinopathies, including life-threatening cases, can occur with YERVOY.

 Monitor patients for clinical signs and symptoms of hypophysitis, adrenal insufficiency (including adrenal crisis), and hyper- or hypothyroidism. Patients may present with fatigue, headache, mental status changes, abdominal pain, unusual bowel habits, and hypotension, or nonspecific symptoms which may resemble other causes such as brain metastasis or underlying disease. Unless an alternate etiology has been identified, signs or symptoms of endocrinopathies should be considered immune-mediated.

 Monitor clinical chemistries, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level, and thyroid function tests at the start of treatment, before each dose, and as clinically indicated based on symptoms. In a limited number of patients, hypophysitis was diagnosed by imaging studies through enlargement of the pituitary gland.

 Withhold YERVOY dosing in symptomatic patients and consider referral to an endocrinologist. Initiate systemic corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent, and initiate appropriate hormone replacement therapy [see     Dosage and Administration (2.3)     ]  .

    Metastatic Melanoma

  In patients receiving YERVOY 3 mg/kg in Trial 1, severe to life-threatening immune-mediated endocrinopathies (requiring hospitalization, urgent medical intervention, or interfering with activities of daily living; Grade 3 to 4) occurred in 9 YERVOY-treated patients (1.8%). All 9 patients had hypopituitarism and some had additional concomitant endocrinopathies such as adrenal insufficiency, hypogonadism, and hypothyroidism. Six of the 9 patients were hospitalized for severe endocrinopathies. Moderate endocrinopathy (requiring hormone replacement or medical intervention; Grade 2) occurred in 12 patients (2.3%) and consisted of hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, hypopituitarism, and 1 case each of hyperthyroidism and Cushing's syndrome. The median time to onset of moderate to severe immune-mediated endocrinopathy was 2.5 months and ranged up to 4.4 months after the initiation of YERVOY.

 Of the 21 patients with moderate to life-threatening endocrinopathy, 17 patients required long-term hormone replacement therapy including, most commonly, adrenal hormones (n=10) and thyroid hormones (n=13).

    Adjuvant Treatment of Melanoma

  In patients receiving YERVOY 10 mg/kg in Trial 2, Grade 3 to 4 immune-mediated endocrinopathies occurred in 39 patients (8%) and Grade 2 immune-mediated endocrinopathies in 93 patients (20%). Of the 39 patients with Grade 3 to 4 immune-mediated endocrinopathies, 35 patients had hypopituitarism (associated with one or more secondary endocrinopathies, e.g., adrenal insufficiency, hypogonadism, and hypothyroidism), 3 patients had hyperthyroidism, and 1 had primary hypothyroidism. The median time to onset of Grade 3 to 4 immune-mediated endocrinopathy was 2.2 months (range: 2 days to 8 months). Twenty-seven of the 39 patients (69%) were hospitalized for immune-mediated endocrinopathies, and 4 patients (10%) were reported to have resolution.

 Of the 93 patients with Grade 2 immune-mediated endocrinopathy, 74 had primary hypopituitarism (associated with one or more secondary endocrinopathy, e.g., adrenal insufficiency, hypogonadism, and hypothyroidism), 9 had primary hypothyroidism, 3 had hyperthyroidism, 3 had thyroiditis with hypo- or hyperthyroidism, 2 had hypogonadism, 1 had both hyperthyroidism and hypopituitarism, and 1 subject developed Graves' ophthalmopathy. The median time to onset of Grade 2 immune-mediated endocrinopathy was 2.1 months (range: 9 days to 19.3 months), and 20% were reported to have resolution.

 One hundred twenty-four patients received systemic corticosteroids as immunosuppression and/or adrenal hormone replacement for Grade 2 to 4 immune-mediated endocrinopathy. Of these, 42 (34%) were able to discontinue corticosteroids. Seventy-three patients received thyroid hormones for treatment of Grade 2 to 4 immune-mediated hypothyroidism. Of these, 14 patients (19%) were able to discontinue thyroid replacement therapy.

    5.6   Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions, Including Ocular Manifestations

  Permanently discontinue YERVOY for clinically significant or severe immune-mediated adverse reactions. Initiate systemic corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent for severe immune-mediated adverse reactions.

 Administer corticosteroid eye drops to patients who develop uveitis, iritis, or episcleritis. Permanently discontinue YERVOY for immune-mediated ocular disease that is unresponsive to local immunosuppressive therapy [see     Dosage and Administration (2.3)     ]  . If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, which has been observed in patients receiving YERVOY and may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss.  

    Metastatic Melanoma

  In Trial 1, the following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions were seen in less than 1% of YERVOY-treated patients: nephritis, pneumonitis, meningitis, pericarditis, uveitis, iritis, and hemolytic anemia.

    Adjuvant Treatment of Melanoma

  In Trial 2, the following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions were seen in less than 1% of YERVOY-treated patients unless specified: eosinophilia (2.1%), pancreatitis (1.3%), meningitis, pneumonitis, sarcoidosis, pericarditis, uveitis, and fatal myocarditis [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .

    Other Clinical Experience

  Across 21 dose-ranging trials administering YERVOY at doses of 0.1 to 20 mg/kg (n=2478), the following likely immune-mediated adverse reactions were also reported with less than 1% incidence: angiopathy, temporal arteritis, vasculitis, polymyalgia rheumatica, conjunctivitis, blepharitis, episcleritis, scleritis, iritis, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, erythema multiforme, psoriasis, arthritis, autoimmune thyroiditis, neurosensory hypoacusis, autoimmune central neuropathy (encephalitis), myositis, polymyositis, ocular myositis, hemolytic anemia, and nephritis.

    5.7   Embryo-fetal Toxicity

  Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal studies, YERVOY can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of ipilimumab to cynomolgus monkeys from the onset of organogenesis through delivery resulted in higher incidences of abortion, stillbirth, premature delivery (with corresponding lower birth weight), and higher incidences of infant mortality in a dose-related manner. The effects of ipilimumab are likely to be greater during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with a YERVOY-containing regimen and for 3 months after the last dose of YERVOY [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1  ,  8.3)  ]  .
