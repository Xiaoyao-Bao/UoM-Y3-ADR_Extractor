  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 In the U.S. clinical trial population of 465 patients, the adverse reactions summarized in Table 2 were reported to occur in 1% or more of patients on therapy with omeprazole. Numbers in parentheses indicate percentages of the adverse reactions considered by investigators as possibly, probably or definitely related to the drug.

   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of omeprazole. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Body as a Whole:  Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, anaphylactic shock, angioedema, bronchospasm, interstitial nephritis, urticaria (see also Skin below), fever, pain, fatigue, malaise, and systemic lupus erythematosus.



   Cardiovascular:  Chest pain or angina, tachycardia, bradycardia, palpitation, elevated blood pressure, and peripheral edema.



   Gastrointestinal:  Pancreatitis (some fatal), anorexia, irritable colon, flatulence, fecal discoloration, esophageal candidiasis, mucosal atrophy of the tongue, dry mouth, stomatitis, abdominal swelling and fundic gland polyps. Gastroduodenal carcinoids have been reported in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome on long-term treatment with omeprazole. This finding is believed to be a manifestation of the underlying condition, which is known to be associated with such tumors.



   Hepatic:  Mild and, rarely, marked elevations of liver function tests [ALT (SGPT), AST (SGOT), ᵞ-glutamyl transpeptidase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin (jaundice)]. In rare instances, overt liver disease has occurred, including hepatocellular, cholestatic, or mixed hepatitis, liver necrosis (some fatal), hepatic failure (some fatal), and hepatic encephalopathy.



   Infections and Infestations: Clostridium difficile  -associated diarrhea.



   Metabolism and Nutritional Disorders:  Hyponatremia, hypoglycemia, hypomagnesemia, and weight gain.



   Musculoskeletal:  Muscle cramps, myalgia, muscle weakness, joint pain, bone fracture, and leg pain.



   Nervous System/Psychiatric:  Psychic disturbances including depression, agitation, aggression, hallucinations, confusion, insomnia, nervousness, tremors, apathy, somnolence, anxiety, dream abnormalities; vertigo; paresthesia; and hemifacial dysesthesia.



   Respiratory:  Epistaxis, pharyngeal pain.



   Skin:  Severe generalized skin reactions including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN; some fatal), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, cutaneous lupus erythematosus and erythema multiforme (some severe); purpura and/or petechiae (some with rechallenge); skin inflammation, urticaria, angioedema, pruritus, photosensitivity, alopecia, dry skin, and hyperhidrosis.



   Special Senses:  Tinnitus, taste perversion.



   Ocular:  Blurred vision, ocular irritation, dry eye syndrome, optic atrophy, anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, optic neuritis, and double vision.



   Urogenital:  Interstitial nephritis (some with positive rechallenge), urinary tract infection, microscopic pyuria, urinary frequency, elevated serum creatinine, proteinuria, hematuria, glycosuria, testicular pain, and gynecomastia.



   Hematologic:  Rare instances of pancytopenia, agranulocytosis (some fatal), thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, leukocytosis, and hemolytic anemia have been reported.



 The incidence of clinical adverse experiences in patients greater than 65 years of age was similar to that in patients 65 years of age or less.



 Additional adverse reactions that could be caused by sodium bicarbonate include metabolic alkalosis, seizures, and tetany.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *     Gastric Malignancy : In adults, symptomatic response does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Consider additional follow-up and diagnostic testing. (  5.1  ) 
 *    Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs. (  5.2  ) 
 *     Buffer Content : contains sodium bicarbonate (  5.3  ) 
 *    PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk of Clostridium difficile- associated diarrhea. (  5.4  ) 
 *     Bone Fracture : Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. (  5.5  ) 
 *     Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus : Mostly cutaneous; new onset or exacerbation of existing disease; discontinue ZEGERID and refer to specialist for evaluation. (  5.6  ) 
 *    Avoid concomitant use of ZEGERID with clopidogrel. (  5.7  ) 
 *     Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency : Daily long-term use (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption or a deficiency of cyanocobalamin. (  5.8  ) 
 *    Hypomagnesemia has been reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs. (  5.9  ) 
 *    Avoid concomitant use of ZEGERID with St. John's wort or rifampin due to the potential reduction in omeprazole concentrations. (  5.10  ,  7.2  ) 
 *     Interactions with Diagnostic Investigations for Neuroendocrine Tumors : Increases in intragastric pH may result in hypergastrinemia and enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia and increased Chromogranin A levels which may interfere with diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. (  5.11  ,  12.2  ) 
 *     Interaction with Methotrexate : Concomitant use with PPIs may elevate and/or prolong serum concentrations of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to toxicity. With high dose methotrexate administration, consider a temporary withdrawal of ZEGERID. (  5.12  ,  7.8  ) 
 *     Fundic Gland Polyps : Risk increases with long-term use, especially beyond one year. Use the shortest duration of therapy. (5.13) 
    
 

   5.1 Presence of Gastric Malignancy



  In adults, symptomatic response to therapy with ZEGERID does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Consider additional follow-up and diagnostic testing in adult patients who have a suboptimal response or an early symptomatic relapse after completing treatment with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). In older patients, also consider an endoscopy.



    5.2 Acute Interstitial Nephritis



  Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs including ZEGERID. Acute interstitial nephritis may occur at any point during PPI therapy and is generally attributed to an idiopathic hypersensitivity reaction. Discontinue ZEGERID if acute interstitial nephritis develops. [See  Contraindications (4)  .]  



    5.3 Buffer Content



  Each ZEGERID Capsule contains 1,100 mg (13 mEq) of sodium bicarbonate. The total content of sodium in each capsule is 304 mg.



 Each packet of ZEGERID Powder for Oral Suspension contains 1,680 mg (20 mEq) of sodium bicarbonate (equivalent to 460 mg of Na+).



 The sodium content of ZEGERID products should be taken into consideration when administering to patients on a sodium restricted diet.



 Because ZEGERID products contain sodium bicarbonate, they should be used with caution in patients with Bartter's syndrome, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and problems with acid-base balance. Long-term administration of bicarbonate with calcium or milk can cause milk-alkali syndrome.



 Chronic use of sodium bicarbonate may lead to systemic alkalosis, and increased sodium intake can produce edema and weight increase.



    5.4 Clostridium difficile-  Associated Diarrhea



  Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like ZEGERID may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile-  associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve. [See  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  .]  



 Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated.



    5.5 Bone Fracture



  Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to the established treatment guidelines. [See  Dosage and Administration (2)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  .]  



    5.6 Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus



  Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been reported in patients taking PPIs, including omeprazole. These events have occurred as both new onset and an exacerbation of existing autoimmune disease. The majority of PPI-induced lupus erythematous cases were CLE.



 The most common form of CLE reported in patients treated with PPIs was subacute CLE (SCLE) and occurred within weeks to years after continuous drug therapy in patients ranging from infants to the elderly. Generally, histological findings were observed without organ involvement.



 Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is less commonly reported than CLE in patients receiving PPIs. PPI associated SLE is usually milder than non-drug induced SLE. Onset of SLE typically occurred within days to years after initiating treatment in patients ranging from young adults to the elderly. The majority of patients presented with rash; however, arthralgia and cytopenia were also reported.



 Avoid administration of PPIs for longer than medically indicated. If signs or symptoms consistent with CLE or SLE are noted in patients receiving ZEGERID, discontinue the drug and refer the patient to the appropriate specialist for evaluation. Most patients improve with discontinuation of the PPI alone in 4 to 12 weeks. Serological testing (e.g., ANA) may be positive and elevated serological test results may take longer to resolve than clinical manifestations.



    5.7 Interaction with Clopidogrel



  Avoid concomitant use of ZEGERID with clopidogrel. Clopidogrel is a prodrug. Inhibition of platelet aggregation by clopidogrel is entirely due to an active metabolite. The metabolism of clopidogrel to its active metabolite can be impaired by use with concomitant medications, such as omeprazole, that interfere with CYP2C19 activity. Concomitant use of clopidogrel with 80 mg omeprazole reduces the pharmacological activity of clopidogrel, even when administered 12 hours apart. When using ZEGERID, consider alternative antiplatelet therapy. [See  Drug Interactions (7.5)  and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)    . ]  



    5.8 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency



  Daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed.



    5.9 Hypomagnesemia



  Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI.



 For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), healthcare professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically. [See  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  .]  



    5.10 Concomitant Use of ZEGERID with St. John's Wort or Rifampin



  Drugs which induce CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 (such as St. John's wort or rifampin) can substantially decrease omeprazole concentrations [see  Drug Interactions (7.2)  ].  Avoid concomitant use of ZEGERID with St. John's wort or rifampin.



    5.11 Interactions with Investigations for Neuroendocrine Tumors



  Serum chromogranin A (CgA) levels increase secondary to drug-induced decreases in gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. Providers should temporarily stop omeprazole treatment before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high. If serial tests are performed (e.g., for monitoring), the same commercial laboratory should be used for testing, as reference ranges between tests may vary. [See  Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)  .]  



    5.12 Concomitant Use of ZEGERID with Methotrexate



  Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients. [See  Drug Interactions (7.8)  .]  



    5.13 Fundic Gland Polyps



   PPI use is associated with an increased risk of fundic gland polyps that increases with long-term use, especially beyond one year. Most PPIs users who developed fundic gland polyps were asymptomatic and fundic gland polyps were identified incidentally on endoscopy. Use the shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated.
