  6.1       Clinical Trial Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of other drugs and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



   Patients    with Chronic Kidney Disease  



   Adult    Patients  



 Three double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, including 244 patients with CKD on dialysis, were used to identify the adverse reactions to Epogen.  In these studies, the mean age of patients was 48 years (range: 20 to 80 years).  One hundred and thirty-three (55%) patients were men. The racial distribution was as follows: 177 (73%) patients were white, 48 (20%) patients were black, 4 (2%) patients were Asian, 12 (5%) patients were other, and racial information was missing for 3 (1%) patients.



 Two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, including 210 patients with CKD not on dialysis, were used to identify the adverse reactions to Epogen. In these studies, the mean age of patients was 57 years (range: 24 to 79 years). One hundred and twenty-one (58%) patients were men. The racial distribution was as follows: 164 (78%) patients were white, 38 (18%) patients were black, 3 (1%) patients were Asian, 3 (1%) patients were other, and racial information was missing for 2 (1%) patients.



 The adverse reactions with a reported incidence of &gt;= 5% in Epogen-treated patients and that occurred at a &gt;= 1% higher frequency than in placebo-treated patients are shown in the table below:

         Additional serious adverse reactions that occurred in less than 5% of epoetin alfa-treated patients not on dialysis and greater than placebo were erythema (0.8% Epogen and 0% placebo) and myocardial infarction (0.8% Epogen and 0% placebo)  [see Warnings and Precautions (      5.1      )]    .  
 

   Pediatric Patients       



 In pediatric patients with CKD on dialysis, the pattern of adverse reactions was similar to that found in adults. 



   Zidovudine-treated    Patients    with         HIV-    infect    ion       



 A total of 297 zidovudine-treated patients with HIV-infection were studied in 4 placebo-controlled studies. A total of 144 (48%) patients were randomly assigned to receive Epogen and 153 (52%) patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo. Epogen was administered at doses between 100 and 200 Units/kg 3 times weekly subcutaneously for up to 12 weeks.



 For the combined Epogen treatment groups, a total of 141 (98%) men and 3 (2%) women between the ages of 24 and 64 years were enrolled.  The racial distribution of the combined Epogen treatment groups was as follows: 129 (90%) white, 8 (6%) black, 1 (1%) Asian, and 6 (4%) other.



 In double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of 3 months duration involving approximately 300 zidovudine-treated patients with HIV-infection, adverse reactions with an incidence of &gt;= 1% in patients treated with Epogen were:

 Pulmonary embolism  1%               Not reported      
           Patients with    Cancer on Chemotherapy  
 

 The data below were obtained in Study C1, a 16-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that enrolled 344 patients with anemia secondary to chemotherapy. There were 333 patients who were evaluable for safety; 168 of 174 patients (97%) randomized to Epogen received at least 1 dose of study drug, and 165 of 170 patients (97%) randomized to placebo received at least 1 placebo dose. For the once weekly Epogen-treatment group, a total of 76 men (45%) and 92 women (55%) between the ages of 20 and 88 years were treated. The racial distribution of the Epogen-treatment group was 158 white (94%) and 10 black (6%). Epogen was administered once weekly for an average of 13 weeks at a dose of 20,000 to 60,000 IU subcutaneously (mean weekly dose was 49,000 IU).

           Surgery Patients  
 

 Four hundred sixty-one patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery were studied in a placebo-controlled study (S1) and a comparative dosing study (2 dosing regimens, S2). A total of 358 patients were randomly assigned to receive Epogen and 103 (22%) patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo. Epogen was administered daily at a dose of 100 to 300 IU/kg subcutaneously for 15 days or at 600 IU/kg once weekly for 4 weeks.



 For the combined Epogen treatment groups, a total of 90 (25%) and 268 (75%) women between the ages of 29 and 89 years were enrolled. The racial distribution of the combined Epogen treatment groups was as follows: 288 (80%) white, 64 (18%) black, 1 (&lt; 1%) Asian, and 5 (1%) other.



 The adverse reactions with a reported incidence of &gt;= 1% in Epogen-treated patients that occurred at a higher frequency than in placebo-treated patients are shown in the table below:

   c  DVTs were determined by clinical symptoms.



   6.2       Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Epogen.



 Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 *  Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (    5.4    )]  
 *  PRCA [see Warnings and Precautions (    5.6    )]  
 *  Serious allergic reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (    5.7    )]  
 *  Injection site reactions, including irritation and pain 
 *  Porphyria 
 *  Severe Cutaneous Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (    5.8    )]  
      6.3       Immunogenicity
   As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to epoetin alfa with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.



 Neutralizing antibodies to epoetin alfa that cross-react with endogenous erythropoietin and other ESAs     can result in PRCA or severe anemia (with or without other cytopenias)  [see Warnings and Precautions (      5.6      )    ]  .

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: ESAs INCREASE THE RISK OF DEATH, MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, STROKE, VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM, THROMBOSIS OF VASCULAR ACCESS AND TUMOR PROGRESSION OR RECURRENCE

    WARNING:     ESAs INCREASE THE RISK OF DEATH, MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, STROKE, VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM, THROMBOSIS OF VASCULAR ACCESS AND TUMOR PROGRESSION OR RECURRENCE  

    Chronic Kidney Disease:  



 *  In controlled trials, patients experienced greater risks for death, serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, and stroke when administered erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) to target a hemoglobin level of greater than 11 g/dL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 
 *  No trial has identified a hemoglobin target level, ESA dose, or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 
 *  Use the lowest Epogen dose sufficient to reduce the need for red blood cell (RBC) transfusions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 
      Cancer:  
 

 *  ESAs shortened overall survival and/or increased the risk of tumor progression or recurrence in clinical studies of patients with breast, non-small cell lung, head and neck, lymphoid, and cervical cancers [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 
 *  To decrease these risks, as well as the risk of serious cardiovascular and thromboembolic reactions, use the lowest dose needed to avoid RBC transfusions [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 
 *  Use ESAs only for anemia from myelosuppressive chemotherapy [see Indications and Usage (1.3)]. 
 *  ESAs are not indicated for patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy when the anticipated outcome is cure [see Indications and Usage (1.5)]. 
 *  Discontinue following the completion of a chemotherapy course [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 
      Perisurgery:  
 

 *  Due to increased risk of Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT), DVT prophylaxis is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings and precautions">     5        WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  



     EXCERPT:    *  Increased Mortality, Myocardial Infarction, Stroke, and Thromboembolism: Using ESAs to target a hemoglobin level of greater than 11 g/dL increases the risk of serious adverse cardiovascular reactions and has not been shown to provide additional benefit (  5.1  and  14.1  ). Use caution in patients with coexistent cardiovascular disease and stroke (  5.1  ). 
 *  Increased Mortality and/or Increased Risk of Tumor Progression or Recurrence in Patients With Cancer (  5.2  ). 
 *  Hypertension: Control hypertension prior to initiating and during treatment with Epogen (  5.3  ). 
 *  Seizures: Epogen increases the risk for seizures in patients with CKD (  5.4  ). Increase monitoring of these patients for changes in seizure frequency or premonitory symptoms (  5.4  ). 
 *  PRCA: If severe anemia and low reticulocyte count develop during Epogen treatment, withhold Epogen and evaluate for PRCA (  5.6  ). 
 *  Serious Allergic Reactions: Discontinue Epogen and manage reactions (  5.7  ). 
 *  Severe Cutaneous Reactions: Discontinue Epogen (  5.8  ). 
    
 

   5.1       Increased Mortality, Myocardial Infarction, Stroke, and Thromboembolism



    *  In controlled clinical trials of patients with CKD comparing higher hemoglobin targets (13 - 14 g/dL) to lower targets (9 - 11.3 g/dL), Epogen and other ESAs increased the risk of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, thrombosis of hemodialysis vascular access, and other thromboembolic events in the higher target groups. 
 *  Using ESAs to target a hemoglobin level of greater than 11 g/dL increases the risk of serious adverse cardiovascular reactions and has not been shown to provide additional benefit  [see Clinical Studies (    14.1    )] . Use caution in patients with coexistent cardiovascular disease and stroke [see Dosage and Administration (    2.2    )] . Patients with CKD and an insufficient hemoglobin response to ESA therapy may be at even greater risk for cardiovascular reactions and mortality than other patients. A rate of hemoglobin rise of greater than 1 g/dL over 2 weeks may contribute to these risks. 
 *  In controlled clinical trials of patients with cancer, Epogen and other ESAs increased the risks for death and serious adverse cardiovascular reactions. These adverse reactions included myocardial infarction and stroke. 
 *  In controlled clinical trials, ESAs increased the risk of death in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) and the risk of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in patients undergoing orthopedic procedures. 
    The design and overall results of the 3 large trials comparing higher and lower hemoglobin targets are shown in Table 1.

           Patients with   Chronic   Kidney Disease  
 

 Normal Hematocrit Study (NHS): A prospective, randomized, open-label study of 1265 patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis with documented evidence of congestive heart failure or ischemic heart disease was designed to test the hypothesis that a higher target hematocrit (Hct) would result in improved outcomes compared with a lower target Hct.  In this study, patients were randomized to epoetin alfa treatment targeted to a maintenance hemoglobin of either 14 +/- 1 g/dL or 10 +/- 1 g/dL.  The trial was terminated early with adverse safety findings of higher mortality in the high hematocrit target group. Higher mortality (35% vs. 29%) was observed for the patients randomized to a target hemoglobin of 14 g/dL than for the patients randomized to a target hemoglobin of 10 g/dL.  For all-cause mortality, the HR = 1.27; 95% CI (1.04, 1.54); p = 0.018.  The incidence of nonfatal myocardial infarction, vascular access thrombosis, and other thrombotic events was also higher in the group randomized to a target hemoglobin of 14 g/dL.



  CHOIR: A randomized, prospective trial, 1432 patients with anemia due to CKD who were not undergoing dialysis and who had not previously received epoetin alfa therapy were randomized to epoetin alfa treatment targeting a maintenance hemoglobin concentration of either 13.5 g/dL or 11.3 g/dL.  The trial was terminated early with adverse safety findings. A major cardiovascular event (death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or hospitalization for congestive heart failure) occurred in 125 of the 715 patients (18%) in the higher hemoglobin group compared to  97 of the 717 patients (14%) in the lower hemoglobin group [hazard ratio (HR) 1.34, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.74; p = 0.03].
 

 TREAT: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, prospective trial of 4038 patients with: CKD not on dialysis (eGFR of 20 - 60 mL/min), anemia (hemoglobin levels &lt;= 11 g/dL), and type 2 diabetes mellitus, patients were randomized to receive either darbepoetin alfa treatment or a matching placebo.  Placebo group patients also received darbepoetin alfa when their hemoglobin levels were below 9 g/dL.  The trial objectives were to demonstrate the benefit of darbepoetin alfa treatment of the anemia to a target hemoglobin level of 13 g/dL, when compared to a "placebo" group, by reducing the occurrence of either of two primary endpoints: (1) a composite cardiovascular endpoint of all-cause mortality or a specified cardiovascular event (myocardial ischemia, CHF, MI, and CVA) or (2) a composite renal endpoint of all-cause mortality or progression to end stage renal disease.  The overall risks for each of the two primary endpoints (the cardiovascular composite and the renal composite) were not reduced with darbepoetin alfa treatment (see Table 1), but the risk of stroke was increased nearly two-fold in the darbepoetin alfa-treated group versus the placebo group: annualized stroke rate 2.1% vs. 1.1%, respectively, HR 1.92; 95% CI: 1.38, 2.68; p &lt; 0.001. The relative risk of stroke was particularly high in patients with a prior stroke: annualized stroke rate 5.2% in the darbepoetin alfa-treated group and 1.9% in the placebo group, HR 3.07; 95% CI: 1.44, 6.54.  Also, among darbepoetin alfa-treated subjects with a past history of cancer, there were more deaths due to all causes and more deaths adjudicated as due to cancer, in comparison with the control group.



  Patients with Cancer      



 An increased incidence of thromboembolic reactions, some serious and life-threatening, occurred in patients with cancer treated with ESAs.



 In a randomized, placebo-controlled study (Study 2 in Table 2  [see Warnings and Precautions (     5.2     )]  ) of 939 women with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy, patients received either weekly epoetin alfa or placebo for up to a year. This study was designed to show that survival was superior when epoetin alfa was administered to prevent anemia (maintain hemoglobin levels between 12 and 14 g/dL or hematocrit between 36% and 42%). This study was terminated prematurely when interim results demonstrated a higher mortality at 4 months (8.7% vs. 3.4%) and a higher rate of fatal thrombotic reactions (1.1% vs. 0.2%) in the first 4 months of the study among patients treated with epoetin alfa. Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates, at the time of study termination, the 12-month survival was lower in the epoetin alfa group than in the placebo group (70% vs. 76%; HR 1.37, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.75; p = 0.012).



  Patients Having Surgery      



 An increased incidence of deep venous     thrombosis (DVT) in patients receiving epoetin alfa undergoing surgical orthopedic procedures was demonstrated [   see Adverse Reactions (     6.1     )   ]  . In a randomized, controlled study, 680 adult patients, not receiving prophylactic anticoagulation and undergoing spinal surgery, were randomized to 4 doses of 600 Units/kg epoetin alfa (7, 14, and 21 days before surgery, and the day of surgery) and standard of care (SOC) treatment (n = 340) or to SOC treatment alone (n = 340).  A higher incidence of DVTs, determined by either color flow duplex imaging or by clinical symptoms, was observed in the epoetin alfa group (16 [4.7%] patients) compared with the SOC group (7 [2.1%] patients).  In addition to the 23 patients with DVTs included in the primary analysis, 19 [2.8%] patients (n = 680) experienced 1 other thrombovascular event (TVE) each (12 [3.5%] in the epoetin alfa group and 7 [2.1%] in the SOC group).  Deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis is strongly recommended when ESAs are used for the reduction of allogeneic RBC transfusions in surgical patients [   see       Dosage and Administration (     2.5     )   ]  .



 Increased mortality was observed in a randomized, placebo-controlled study of Epogen in adult patients who were undergoing CABG surgery (7 deaths in 126 patients randomized to Epogen versus no deaths among 56 patients receiving placebo). Four of these deaths occurred during the period of study drug administration and all 4 deaths were associated with thrombotic events.     



    5.2       Increased Mortality and/or Increased Risk of Tumor Progression or Recurrence in Patients With Cancer



  ESAs resulted in decreased locoregional control/progression-free survival (PFS) and/or overall survival (OS) (see Table 2).    



 Adverse effects on PFS and/or OS were observed in studies of patients receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer (Studies 1, 2, and 4), lymphoid malignancy (Study 3), and cervical cancer (Study 5); in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving radiation therapy (Studies 6 and 7); and in patients with non-small cell lung cancer or various malignancies who were not receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy (Studies 8 and 9).

 This study did not include a defined hemoglobin target. Doses were titrated to achieve and maintain the lowest hemoglobin level sufficient to avoid transfusion and not to exceed 12 g/dL.



  Decreased Overall Survival  



 Study 2 was described in the previous section [see Warnings and Precautions (     5.1     )].  Mortality at 4 months (8.7% vs. 3.4%) was significantly higher in the epoetin alfa arm. The most common investigator-attributed cause of death within the first 4 months was disease progression; 28 of 41 deaths in the epoetin alfa arm and 13 of 16 deaths in the placebo arm were attributed to disease progression. Investigator-assessed time to tumor progression was not different between the 2 groups. Survival at 12 months was significantly lower in the epoetin alfa arm (70% vs. 76%; HR 1.37, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.75; p = 0.012).



 Study 3 was a randomized, double-blind study (darbepoetin alfa vs. placebo) conducted in 344 anemic patients with lymphoid malignancy receiving chemotherapy.  With a median follow-up of 29 months, overall mortality rates were significantly higher among patients randomized to darbepoetin alfa as compared to placebo (HR 1.36, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.82).



 Study 8 was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind study (epoetin alfa vs. placebo) in which patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer receiving only palliative radiotherapy or no active therapy were treated with epoetin alfa to achieve and maintain hemoglobin levels between 12 and 14 g/dL. Following an interim analysis of 70 patients (planned accrual 300 patients), a significant difference in survival in favor of the patients in the placebo arm of the study was observed (median survival 63 vs. 129 days; HR 1.84; p = 0.04).



 Study 9 was a randomized, double-blind study (darbepoetin alfa vs. placebo) in 989 anemic patients with active malignant disease, neither receiving nor planning to receive chemotherapy or radiation therapy. There was no evidence of a statistically significant reduction in proportion of patients receiving RBC transfusions. The median survival was shorter in the darbepoetin alfa treatment group than in the placebo group (8 months vs. 10.8 months; HR 1.30, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.57).



   Decreased Progression-free Survival and Overall Survival    



    



  Study 1 was a randomized, open-label, multicenter study in 2,098 anemic women with metastatic breast cancer, who received first line or second line chemotherapy. This was a non-inferiority study designed to rule out a 15% risk increase in tumor progression or death of epoetin alfa plus standard of care (SOC) as compared with SOC alone. At the time of clinical data cutoff, the median progression free survival (PFS) per investigator assessment of disease progression was 7.4 months in each arm (HR 1.09, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.20), indicating the study objective was not met. There were more deaths from disease progression in the epoetin alfa plus SOC arm (59% vs. 56%) and more thrombotic vascular events in the epoetin alfa plus SOC arm (3% vs. 1%). At the final analysis, 1653 deaths were reported (79.8% subjects in the epoetin alfa plus SOC group and 77.8% subjects in the SOC group. Median overall survival in the epoetin alfa plus SOC group was 17.8 months compared with 18.0 months in the SOC alone group (HR 1.07, 95% CI: 0.97, 1.18).  



 Study 4 was a randomized, open-label, controlled, factorial design study in which darbepoetin alfa was administered to prevent anemia in 733 women receiving neo-adjuvant breast cancer treatment. A final analysis was performed after a median follow-up of approximately 3 years. The 3-year survival rate was lower (86% vs. 90%; HR 1.42, 95% CI: 0.93, 2.18) and the 3-year relapse-free survival rate was lower (72% vs. 78%; HR 1.33, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.79) in the darbepoetin alfa-treated arm compared to the control arm.



 Study 5 was a randomized, open-label, controlled study that enrolled 114 of a planned 460 cervical cancer patients receiving chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive epoetin alfa to maintain hemoglobin between 12 and 14 g/dL or to RBC transfusion support as needed. The study was terminated prematurely due to an increase in thromboembolic adverse reactions in epoetin alfa-treated patients compared to control (19% vs. 9%). Both local recurrence (21% vs. 20%) and distant recurrence (12% vs. 7%) were more frequent in epoetin alfa-treated patients compared to control. Progression-free survival at 3 years was lower in the epoetin alfa-treated group compared to control (59% vs. 62%; HR 1.06, 95% CI: 0.58, 1.91).  Overall survival at 3 years was lower in the epoetin alfa-treated group compared to control (61% vs. 71%; HR 1.28, 95% CI: 0.68, 2.42).



 Study 6 was a randomized, placebo-controlled study in 351 head and neck cancer patients where epoetin beta or placebo was administered to achieve target hemoglobins &gt;= 14 and &gt;= 15 g/dL for women and men, respectively. Locoregional progression-free survival was significantly shorter in patients receiving epoetin beta (HR 1.62, 95% CI: 1.22, 2.14; p = 0.0008) with medians of 406 days and 745 days in the epoetin beta and placebo arms, respectively. Overall survival was significantly shorter in patients receiving epoetin beta (HR 1.39, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.84; p = 0.02).



  Decreased Locoregional Control  



 Study 7 was a randomized, open-label, controlled study conducted in 522 patients with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck receiving radiation therapy alone (no chemotherapy) who were randomized to receive darbepoetin alfa to maintain hemoglobin levels of 14 to 15.5 g/dL or no darbepoetin alfa. An interim analysis performed on 484 patients demonstrated that locoregional control at 5 years was significantly shorter in patients receiving darbepoetin alfa (RR 1.44, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.96; p = 0.02). Overall survival was shorter in patients receiving darbepoetin alfa (RR 1.28, 95% CI: 0.98, 1.68; p = 0.08).



    5.3       Hypertension



  Epogen is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension.  Following initiation and titration of Epogen, approximately 25% of patients on dialysis required initiation of or increases in antihypertensive therapy; hypertensive encephalopathy and seizures have been reported in patients with CKD receiving Epogen.



 Appropriately control hypertension prior to initiation of and during treatment with Epogen.  Reduce or withhold Epogen if blood pressure becomes difficult to control.  Advise patients of the importance of compliance with antihypertensive therapy and dietary restrictions  [see Patient Counseling Information (     17     )]  .



    5.4       Seizures



  Epogen increases the risk of seizures in patients with CKD. During the first several months following initiation of Epogen, monitor patients closely for premonitory neurologic symptoms. Advise patients to contact their healthcare practitioner for new-onset seizures, premonitory symptoms or change in seizure frequency.



    5.5       Lack or Loss of Hemoglobin Response to Epogen



  For lack or loss of hemoglobin response to Epogen, initiate a search for causative factors (e.g., iron deficiency, infection, inflammation, bleeding). If typical causes of lack or loss of hemoglobin response are excluded, evaluate for PRCA  [see Warnings and Precautions (     5.6     )]  . In the absence of PRCA, follow dosing recommendations for management of patients with an insufficient hemoglobin response to Epogen therapy [see Dosage and Administration (     2.2     )]  .



    5.6       Pure Red Cell Aplasia



  Cases of PRCA and of severe anemia, with or without other cytopenias that arise following the development of neutralizing antibodies to erythropoietin have been reported in patients treated with Epogen. This has been reported predominantly in patients with CKD receiving ESAs by subcutaneous administration. PRCA has also been reported in patients receiving ESAs for anemia related to hepatitis C treatment (an indication for which Epogen is not approved).



 If severe anemia and low reticulocyte count develop during treatment with Epogen, withhold Epogen and evaluate patients for neutralizing antibodies to erythropoietin. Contact Amgen (1-800-77-AMGEN) to perform assays for binding and neutralizing antibodies. Permanently discontinue Epogen in patients who develop PRCA following treatment with Epogen or other erythropoietin protein drugs. Do not switch patients to other ESAs.



    5.7       Serious Allergic Reactions 



  Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, skin rash, and urticaria may occur with Epogen. Immediately and permanently discontinue Epogen and administer appropriate therapy if a serious allergic or anaphylactic reaction occurs.



    5.8       Severe Cutaneous Reactions



   Blistering and skin exfoliation reactions including Erythema multiforme and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS)/Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN), have been reported in patients treated with ESAs (including Epogen) in the postmarketing setting. Discontinue Epogen therapy immediately if a severe cutaneous reaction, such as SJS/TEN, is suspected.  



    5.9       Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative



   Epogen from multiple-dose vials contains benzyl alcohol and is contraindicated for use in neonates, infants, pregnant women, and lactating women [   see Contraindications (     4     )   ]  . In addition, do not mix Epogen with bacteriostatic saline (which also contains benzyl alcohol) when administering Epogen to these patient populations [see Dosage and Administration (     2     )].    



    



  Serious and fatal reactions including "gasping syndrome" can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including Epogen multiple-dose vials. The "gasping syndrome" is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. There is a potential for similar risks to fetuses and infants exposed to benzyl alcohol in utero  or in breast-fed milk, respectively. Epogen multiple-dose vials contain 11 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which serious adverse reactions may occur is not known [see Use in Specific Populations (     8.1     ,     8.2     , and     8.4     )].    



    5.10       Risk of Infectious Diseases Due to Albumin (Human) Content



  Epogen contains albumin, a derivative of human blood [see Description (     11     )].  Based on effective donor screening and product manufacturing processes, it carries an extremely remote risk for transmission of viral diseases. A theoretical risk for transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) also is considered extremely remote. No cases of transmission of viral diseases or CJD have ever been identified for albumin.



    5.11       Dialysis Management



  Patients may require adjustments in their dialysis prescriptions after initiation of Epogen. Patients receiving Epogen may require increased anticoagulation with heparin to prevent clotting of the extracorporeal circuit during hemodialysis.
