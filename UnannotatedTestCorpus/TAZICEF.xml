  Ceftazidime is generally well tolerated. The incidence of adverse reactions associated with the administration of ceftazidime was low in clinical trials. The most common were local reactions following IV injection and allergic and gastrointestinal reactions. Other adverse reactions were encountered infrequently. No disulfiram-like reactions were reported.



 The following adverse effects from clinical trials were considered to be either related to ceftazidime therapy or were of uncertain etiology:



     Local Effects,    reported in fewer than 2% of patients, were phlebitis and inflammation at the site of injection (1 in 69 patients).



     Hypersensitivity Reactions,    reported in 2% of patients, were pruritus, rash, and fever. Immediate reactions, generally manifested by rash and/or pruritus, occurred in 1 in 285 patients. Toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and erythema multiforme have also been reported with cephalosporin antibacterial drugs, including ceftazidime. Angioedema and anaphylaxis (bronchospasm and/or hypotension) have been reported very rarely.



     Gastrointestinal Symptoms,    reported in fewer than 2% of patients, were diarrhea (1 in 78), nausea (1 in 156), vomiting (1 in 500), and abdominal pain (1 in 416). The onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after treatment (see    WARNINGS    ).



     Central Nervous System Reactions    (fewer than 1%) included headache, dizziness, and paresthesia. Seizures have been reported with several cephalosporins, including ceftazidime. In addition, encephalopathy, coma, asterixis, neuromuscular excitability, and myoclonia have been reported in renally impaired patients treated with unadjusted dosing regimens of ceftazidime (see    PRECAUTIONS: General    ).



     Less Frequent Adverse Events    (fewer than 1%) were candidiasis (including oral thrush) and vaginitis.



     Hematologic    



 Rare cases of hemolytic anemia have been reported.



     Laboratory Test Changes    noted during clinical trials with Tazicef (ceftazidime for injection, USP) were transient and included: eosinophilia (1 in 13), positive Coombs test without hemolysis (1 in 23), thrombocytosis (1 in 45), and slight elevations in one or more of the hepatic enzymes, aspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT) (1 in 16), alanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT) (1 in 15), LDH (1 in 18), GGT (1 in 19), and alkaline phosphatase (1 in 23). As with some other cephalosporins, transient elevations of blood urea, blood urea nitrogen, and/or serum creatinine were observed occasionally. Transient leukopenia, neutropenia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and lymphocytosis were seen very rarely.



     Postmarketing Experience with Tazicef (ceftazidime for injection, USP) Products    



 In addition to the adverse events reported during clinical trials, the following events have been observed during clinical practice in patients treated with Tazicef and were reported spontaneously. For some of these events, data are insufficient to allow an estimate of incidence or to establish causation.



     General     



 Anaphylaxis; allergic reactions, which, in rare instances, were severe (e.g., cardiopulmonary arrest); urticaria; pain at injection site.



     Hepatobiliary Tract    



 Hyperbilirubinemia, jaundice.



     Renal and Genitourinary    



 Renal impairment.



     Cephalosporin-Class Adverse Reactions    



 In addition to the adverse reactions listed above that have been observed in patients treated with ceftazidime, the following adverse reactions and altered laboratory tests have been reported for cephalosporin-class antibacterial drugs:



     Adverse Reactions    



 Colitis, toxic nephropathy, hepatic dysfunction including cholestasis, aplastic anemia, hemorrhage.



     Altered Laboratory Tests    



 Prolonged prothrombin time, false-positive test for urinary glucose, pancytopenia.

    General  



  High and prolonged serum ceftazidime concentrations can occur from usual dosages in patients with transient or persistent reduction of urinary output because of renal insufficiency.



 The total daily dosage should be reduced when ceftazidime is administered to patients with renal insufficiency (see   DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION    ). Elevated levels of ceftazidime in these patients can lead to seizures, nonconvulsive status epilepticus, encephalopathy, coma, asterixis, neuromuscular excitability, and myoclonia. Continued dosage should be determined by degree of renal impairment, severity of infection, and susceptibility of the causative organisms.



 As with other antibacterial drugs, prolonged use of Tazicef (ceftazidime for injection, USP) may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Repeated evaluation of the patient's condition is essential. If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken.



 Inducible type I beta-lactamase resistance has been noted with some organisms (e.g.,  Enterobacter    spp.,  Pseudomonas    spp., and  Serratia    spp.). As with other extended-spectrum beta-lactam antibacterial drugs, resistance can develop during therapy, leading to clinical failure in some cases. When treating infections caused by these organisms, periodic susceptibility testing should be performed when clinically appropriate. If patients fail to respond to monotherapy, an aminoglycoside or similar agent should be considered.



 Cephalosporins may be associated with a fall in prothrombin activity. Those at risk include patients with renal and hepatic impairment, or poor nutritional state, as well as patients receiving a protracted course of antimicrobial therapy. Prothrombin time should be monitored in patients at risk and exogenous vitamin K administered as indicated.



  Tazicef  should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis.



 Distal necrosis can occur after inadvertent intra-arterial administration of ceftazidime.



 Prescribing Tazicef (ceftazidime) in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.



     Information for Patients  



  Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including Tazicef (ceftazidime), should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Tazicef (ceftazidime) is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may: (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment, and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Tazicef (ceftazidime) or other antibacterial drugs in the future.



 Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs which usually ends when the antibacterial drug is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterial drugs, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as 2 or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial drug. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.



     Drug Interactions  



  Nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of cephalosporins with aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs or potent diuretics such as furosemide. Renal function should be carefully monitored, especially if higher dosages of the aminoglycosides are to be administered or if therapy is prolonged, because of the potential nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity of aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs. Nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity were not noted when ceftazidime was given alone in clinical trials.



 Chloramphenicol has been shown to be antagonistic to beta-lactam antibacterial drugs, including ceftazidime, based on  in vitro    studies and time kill curves with enteric gram-negative bacilli. Due to the possibility of antagonism  in vivo    , particularly when bactericidal activity is desired, this drug combination should be avoided.



 In common with other antibacterial drugs, ceftazidime may affect the gut flora, leading to lower estrogen reabsorption and reduced efficacy of combined oral estrogen/progesterone contraceptives.



     Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions  



  The administration of ceftazidime may result in a false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine when using CLINITEST  (r)  tablets, Benedict's solution, or Fehling's solution.



 It is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions (such as CLINISTIX  (r)  ) be used.



     Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  



  Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential. However, a mouse micronucleus test and an Ames test were both negative for mutagenic effects.



     Pregnancy  



     Teratogenic Effects      



 Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies have been performed in mice and rats at doses up to 40 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to TAZICEF. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.



     Nursing Mothers  



  Ceftazidime is excreted in human milk in low concentrations. Caution should be exercised when TAZICEF is administered to a nursing woman.



     Pediatric Use  



  See   DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION    .



     Geriatric Use  



  Of the 2,221 subjects who received ceftazidime in 11 clinical studies, 824 (37%) were 65 and older while 391 (18%) were 75 and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater susceptibility of some older individuals to drug effects cannot be ruled out. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function (see   DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION    ).

  BEFORE THERAPY WITH TAZICEF IS INSTITUTED, CAREFUL INQUIRY SHOULD BE MADE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE PATIENT HAS HAD PREVIOUS HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS TO CEFTAZIDIME, CEPHALOSPORINS, PENICILLINS, OR OTHER DRUGS. IF THIS PRODUCT IS TO BE GIVEN TO PENICILLIN-SENSITIVE PATIENTS, CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED BECAUSE CROSS-HYPERSENSITIVITY AMONG BETA-LACTAM ANTIBACTERIAL DRUGS HAS BEEN CLEARLY DOCUMENTED AND MAY OCCUR IN UP TO 10% OF PATIENTS WITH A HISTORY OF PENICILLIN ALLERGY. IF AN ALLERGIC REACTION TO TAZICEF OCCURS, DISCONTINUE THE DRUG. SERIOUS ACUTE HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS MAY REQUIRE TREATMENT WITH EPINEPHRINE AND OTHER EMERGENCY MEASURES, INCLUDING OXYGEN, IV FLUIDS, IV ANTIHISTAMINES, CORTICOSTEROIDS, PRESSOR AMINES, AND AIRWAY MANAGEMENT, AS CLINICALLY INDICATED.



   Clostridium difficile    associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including ceftazidime, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of  C. difficile    .



   C. difficile    produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of  C. difficile    cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.



 If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against  C. difficile    may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of  C. difficile    , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.



 Elevated levels of ceftazidime in patients with renal insufficiency can lead to seizures, nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE), encephalopathy, coma, asterixis, neuromuscular excitability, and myoclonia (see   PRECAUTIONS    ).
