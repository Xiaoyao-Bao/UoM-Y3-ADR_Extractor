  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The safety assessment of JULUCA in HIV-1-infected, virologically suppressed subjects switching from their current antiretroviral regimen to dolutegravir plus rilpivirine is based on the pooled primary Week 48 analyses of data from 2 identical, international, multicenter, open-label trials, SWORD-1 and SWORD-2.



 A total of 1,024 adult HIV-1-infected subjects who were on a stable suppressive antiretroviral regimen (containing 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors [NRTIs] plus either an integrase strand transfer inhibitor [INSTI], a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [NNRTI], or a protease inhibitor [PI]) for at least 6 months with no history of treatment failure and no known substitutions associated with resistance to dolutegravir or rilpivirine, were randomized and received treatment. Subjects were randomized 1:1 to continue their current antiretroviral regimen or be switched to dolutegravir plus rilpivirine administered once daily. In the pooled analyses, the proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment due to an adverse event was 4% in subjects receiving dolutegravir plus rilpivirine once daily and less than 1% in subjects who remained on their current antiretroviral regimen. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation were psychiatric disorders: 2% of subjects receiving dolutegravir plus rilpivirine and less than 1% on the current antiretroviral regimen.



 The most common adverse reactions (ARs) (all grades) reported in at least 2% of subjects in the Week 48 pooled analyses from SWORD-1 and SWORD-2 are provided in  Table 2  .

           Changes in Serum Creatinine:  Dolutegravir and rilpivirine have been shown to increase serum creatinine due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine without affecting renal glomerular function  [see Clinical Pharmacology (  12.2  )]  . Increases in serum creatinine occurred within the first 4 weeks of treatment with dolutegravir plus rilpivirine and remained stable through 48 weeks. A mean change from baseline of 0.093 mg per dL (range: -0.30 to 0.58 mg per dL) was observed after 48 weeks of treatment with dolutegravir plus rilpivirine. These changes are not considered to be clinically relevant.
 

   Serum Lipids:  At 48 weeks, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and total cholesterol to HDL ratio were similar between the treatment arms.



   Bone Mineral Density Effects  



 Mean bone mineral density (BMD) increased from baseline to Week 48 in subjects who switched from an antiretroviral treatment (ART) regimen containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) to dolutegravir plus rilpivirine (1.34% total hip and 1.46% lumbar spine) compared with those who continued on treatment with a TDF-containing antiretroviral regimen (0.05% total hip and 0.15% lumbar spine) in a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) substudy. BMD declines of 5% or greater at the lumbar spine were experienced by 2% of subjects receiving JULUCA and 5% of subjects who continued their TDF-containing regimen. The long-term clinical significance of these BMD changes is not known.



 Fractures (excluding fingers and toes) were reported in 3 (0.6%) subjects who switched to dolutegravir plus rilpivirine and 9 (1.8%) subjects who continued their current antiretroviral regimen through 48 weeks.



   Adrenal Function  



 In the pooled Phase 3 trials results analysis of rilpivirine, at Week 96, there was an overall mean change from baseline in basal cortisol of -0.69 (-1.12, 0.27) micrograms/dL in the rilpivirine group and of -0.02 (-0.48, 0.44) micrograms/dL in the efavirenz group. The clinical significance of the higher abnormal rate of 250 micrograms ACTH stimulation tests in the rilpivirine group is not known. Refer to the EDURANT (rilpivirine) Prescribing Information for additional information.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing experience in patients receiving a dolutegravir- or rilpivirine-containing regimen. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Hepatobiliary Disorders  



 Acute liver failure, hepatotoxicity.



   Investigations  



 Weight increased.



   Musculoskeletal Disorders  



 Arthralgia, myalgia.



   Renal and Genitourinary Disorders  



 Nephrotic syndrome.



   Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders  



 Severe skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including DRESS  .  
</Section>
    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *    Severe skin and hypersensitivity reactions characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and sometimes organ dysfunction, including liver injury, have been reported with the individual components. Discontinue JULUCA immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin or hypersensitivity reactions develop, as a delay in stopping treatment may result in a life-threatening reaction. (  5.1  ) 
 *    Hepatotoxicity has been reported in patients receiving a dolutegravir- or rilpivirine-containing regimen. Monitoring for hepatotoxicity is recommended. (  5.2  ) 
 *    Embryo-fetal toxicity may occur when used at the time of conception and in early pregnancy. Avoid use of JULUCA at the time of conception through the first trimester of pregnancy due to the risk of neural tube defects. Advise adolescents and adults of childbearing potential to use effective contraception. (  2.1  ,  5.3  ,  8.1  ,  8.3  ) 
 *    Depressive disorders have been reported with the use of rilpivirine- or dolutegravir-containing regimens. Immediate medical evaluation is recommended for severe depressive symptoms. (  5.4  ,  6.1  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Skin and Hypersensitivity Reactions



  Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with dolutegravir and were characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and sometimes organ dysfunction, including liver injury. These events were reported in less than 1% of subjects receiving dolutegravir in Phase 3 clinical trials.



 Severe skin and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported during postmarketing experience, including cases of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), with rilpivirine-containing regimens. While some skin reactions were accompanied by constitutional symptoms such as fever, other skin reactions were associated with organ dysfunctions, including elevations in hepatic serum biochemistries. During the Phase 3 clinical trials of rilpivirine, treatment-related rashes with at least Grade 2 severity were reported in 3% of subjects. No Grade 4 rash was reported [see Adverse Reactions (  6.2  )]  .



 Discontinue JULUCA immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin or hypersensitivity reactions develop (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters or peeling of the skin, mucosal involvement [oral blisters or lesions], conjunctivitis, facial edema, hepatitis, eosinophilia, angioedema, difficulty breathing). Clinical status, including laboratory parameters with liver aminotransferases, should be monitored and appropriate therapy initiated. Delay in stopping treatment with JULUCA after the onset of hypersensitivity may result in a life-threatening reaction [see Contraindications (  4  )]  .



    5.2 Hepatotoxicity



  Hepatic adverse events have been reported in patients receiving a dolutegravir- or rilpivirine-containing regimen [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . Patients with underlying hepatitis B or C or marked elevations in transaminases prior to treatment may be at increased risk for worsening or development of transaminase elevations. Additionally, in some patients receiving dolutegravir-containing regimens, the elevations in transaminases were consistent with immune reconstitution syndrome or hepatitis B reactivation particularly in the setting where anti-hepatitis therapy was withdrawn. Cases of hepatic toxicity including elevated serum liver biochemistries and hepatitis have also been reported in patients receiving a dolutegravir- or rilpivirine-containing regimen who had no pre-existing hepatic disease or other identifiable risk factors. Drug-induced liver injury leading to acute liver failure has been reported with dolutegravir-containing products, including liver transplant with TRIUMEQ (abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine). Monitoring for hepatotoxicity is recommended.



    5.3 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



   Preliminary data from an observational study showed that dolutegravir, a component of JULUCA, was associated with increased risk of neural tube defects when administered at the time of conception and in early pregnancy. As there is limited understanding of reported types of neural tube defects associated with dolutegravir use and because the date of conception may not be determined with precision, avoid use of JULUCA at the time of conception through the first trimester of pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  )].    



  If there are plans to become pregnant or if pregnancy is confirmed within the first trimester while on JULUCA, if possible, switch to an alternative regimen.  



  Perform pregnancy testing before initiation of JULUCA in adolescents and adults of childbearing potential to exclude use of JULUCA during the first trimester of pregnancy [see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  )].    



  Advise adolescents and adults of childbearing potential to consistently use effective contraception [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  ,  8.3  )].    



    5.4 Depressive Disorders



  Depressive disorders (including depressed mood, depression, dysphoria, major depression, mood altered, negative thoughts, suicide attempt, and suicidal ideation) have been reported with rilpivirine [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . For information regarding depressive disorders reported in patients taking dolutegravir, see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )  . Promptly evaluate patients with severe depressive symptoms to assess whether the symptoms are related to JULUCA and to determine whether the risks of continued therapy outweigh the benefits.



    5.5 Risk of Adverse Reactions or Loss of Virologic Response Due to Drug Interactions



  The concomitant use of JULUCA and other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to [see Contraindications (  4  ), Drug Interactions (  7.4  )]:  



 *    Loss of therapeutic effect of JULUCA and possible development of resistance. 
 *    Possible clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of concomitant drugs. 
    In healthy subjects, 75 mg once daily of rilpivirine (3 times the dose in JULUCA) and 300 mg once daily (12 times the dose in JULUCA) have been shown to prolong the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram [see Drug Interactions (  7.3  ), Clinical Pharmacology (  12.2  )]  . Consider alternatives to JULUCA when coadministered with a drug with a known risk of Torsade de Pointes.
 

 See Table 4 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during therapy with JULUCA; review concomitant medications during therapy with JULUCA; and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drugs.
