  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The most common adverse reactions in adult patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative proctitis in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials are summarized in the  Table 1  below.

           In a multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel group study in 99 patients comparing the CANASA 1000 mg suppository administered nightly to that of the mesalamine 500 mg suppository twice daily. The most common adverse reactions in both groups were headache (14%), flatulence (5%), abdominal pain (5%), diarrhea (3%), and nausea (3%). Three (3) patients discontinued medication because of an adverse reaction; one of these adverse reactions (headache) was deemed possibly related to study medication. The recommended dosage of CANASA is 1000 mg administered rectally once daily at bedtime  [see Dosage and Administration (  2  )].  
 

   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  In addition to the adverse reactions reported above in clinical trials involving CANASA, the adverse reactions listed below have been identified during post-approval use of CANASA and other mesalamine-containing products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 *   Body as a Whole: drug fever, fatigue, lupus-like syndrome, medication residue 
 *   Cardiac Disorders: myocarditis, pericarditis, pericardial effusion [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  )]  
 *   Endocrine: Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus 
 *   Eye disorders : eye swelling 
 *   Gastrointestinal Disorders : abdominal cramps, abdominal distension, anal pruritus, anorectal discomfort, constipation, feces discolored, flatulence, frequent bowel movements, gastrointestinal bleeding, mucus stools, nausea, painful defecation, pancreatitis, proctalgia, rectal discharge, rectal tenesmus, stomach discomfort, vomiting

   EXCERPT:    *   Renal Impairment: Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known renal impairment or taking nephrotoxic drugs; monitor renal function (  5.1  ,  7.1  ,  8.6  ) 
 *   Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome: Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis; monitor for worsening symptoms; discontinue treatment if acute intolerance syndrome is suspected. (  5.2  ) 
 *   Hypersensitivity Reactions, including Myocarditis and Pericarditis: Evaluate patients immediately and discontinue if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. (  5.3  ) 
 *   Hepatic Failure: Evaluate the risks and benefits in patients with known liver impairment. (  5.4  ) 
 *   Interaction with Laboratory Test for Urinary Normetanephrine: Spuriously elevated test results may occur with liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection in patients receiving CANASA; use alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine. (  5.5  ,  7.3  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Renal Impairment



  Renal impairment, including minimal change nephropathy, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and renal failure, has been reported in patients given products such as CANASA that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine [see Adverse Reactions (  6.2  )]  .



 Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of CANASA therapy and periodically while on therapy.



 Evaluate the risks and benefits of using CANASA in patients with known renal impairment or a history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ for toxicity [see Drug Interactions (  7.1  ), Use in Specific Populations (  8.6  ) and Nonclinical Toxicology (  13.2  )].  



    5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome



  Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, and sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Monitor patients for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with CANASA.



    5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions



  Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to CANASA or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine.



 As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue CANASA if an alternative etiology for the signs and symptoms cannot be established.



    5.4 Hepatic Failure



  There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered other products containing mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using CANASA in patients with known liver impairment.



    5.5 Interaction with Laboratory Test for Urinary Normetanephrine



  Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and mesalamine's main metabolite, N-acetylaminosalicylic acid. Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine.
