  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

 BOTOX and BOTOX Cosmetic contain the same active ingredient in the same formulation, but with different labeled Indications and Usage. Therefore, adverse reactions observed with the use of BOTOX Cosmetic also have the potential to be observed with the use of BOTOX.

 In general, adverse reactions occur within the first week following injection of BOTOX and, while generally transient, may have a duration of several months or longer. Localized pain, infection, inflammation, tenderness, swelling, erythema, and/or bleeding/bruising may be associated with the injection. Symptoms associated with flu-like symptoms (e.g., nausea, fever, myalgia) have been reported after treatment. Needle-related pain and/or anxiety may result in vasovagal responses (including syncope, hypotension), which may require appropriate medical therapy.

 Local weakness of the injected muscle(s) represents the expected pharmacological action of botulinum toxin. However, weakness of nearby muscles may also occur due to spread of toxin  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )]  .

     Overactive Bladder  

   Table 11  presents the most frequently reported adverse reactions in double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials for overactive bladder occurring within 12 weeks of the first BOTOX treatment.

           The incidence of UTI increased in patients who experienced a maximum post-void residual (PVR) urine volume &gt;=200 mL following BOTOX injection compared to those with a maximum PVR &lt;200 mL following BOTOX injection, 44% versus 23%, respectively.
 

 No change was observed in the overall safety profile with repeat dosing during an open-label, uncontrolled extension trial.

   Detrusor Overactivity associated with a Neurologic Condition  

   Table 13  presents the most frequently reported adverse reactions in the two Phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (NDO-1 and NDO-2) within 12 weeks of injection for patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurologic condition treated with BOTOX 200 Units.

         The following adverse reactions with BOTOX 200 Units were reported at any time following initial injection and prior to re-injection or study exit (median duration of exposure was 44 weeks): urinary tract infections (49%), urinary retention (17%), constipation (4%), muscular weakness (4%), dysuria (4%), fall (3%), gait disturbance (3%), and muscle spasm (2%).
 

 In the Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients enrolled in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, the MS exacerbation annualized rate (i.e., number of MS exacerbation events per patient-year) was 0.23 for BOTOX and 0.20 for placebo.

 No change was observed in the overall safety profile with repeat dosing.

   Table 14  presents the most frequently reported adverse reactions in a placebo-controlled, double-blind post-approval 52 week study with BOTOX 100 Units (Study NDO-3) conducted in MS patients with urinary incontinence due to detrusor overactivity associated with a neurologic condition. These patients were not adequately managed with at least one anticholinergic agent and not catheterized at baseline. The table below presents the most frequently reported adverse reactions within 12 weeks of injection.

         The following adverse events with BOTOX 100 Units were reported at any time following initial injection and prior to re-injection or study exit (median duration of exposure was 51 weeks): urinary tract infections (39%), bacteriuria (18%), urinary retention (17%), residual urine volume* (17%), dysuria (9%), and hematuria (5%).
 

 No difference in the MS exacerbation annualized rate (i.e., number of MS exacerbating events per patient-year) was observed (BOTOX =0, placebo =0.07).

     Chronic Migraine  

 In double-blind, placebo-controlled chronic migraine efficacy trials (Study 1 and Study 2), the discontinuation rate was 12% in the BOTOX treated group and 10% in the placebo-treated group. Discontinuations due to an adverse event were 4% in the BOTOX group and 1% in the placebo group. The most frequent adverse events leading to discontinuation in the BOTOX group were neck pain, headache, worsening migraine, muscular weakness and eyelid ptosis.

 The most frequently reported adverse reactions following injection of BOTOX for chronic migraine appear in  Table 15  .

         Other adverse reactions that occurred more frequently in the BOTOX group compared to the placebo group at a frequency less than 1% and potentially BOTOX related include: vertigo, dry eye, eyelid edema, dysphagia, eye infection, and jaw pain. Severe worsening of migraine requiring hospitalization occurred in approximately 1% of BOTOX treated patients in Study 1 and Study 2, usually within the first week after treatment, compared to 0.3% of placebo-treated patients.
 

     Upper Limb Spasticity  

 The most frequently reported adverse reactions following injection of BOTOX for adult upper limb spasticity appear in  Table 16  .

           Twenty two adult patients, enrolled in double-blind placebo controlled studies, received 400 Units or higher of BOTOX for treatment of upper limb spasticity. In addition, 44 adults received 400 Units of BOTOX or higher for four consecutive treatments over approximately one year for treatment of upper limb spasticity. The type and frequency of adverse reactions observed in patients treated with 400 Units of BOTOX were similar to those reported in patients treated for upper limb spasticity with 360 Units of BOTOX.
 

     Lower Limb  Spasticity

 The most frequently reported adverse reactions following injection of BOTOX for adult lower limb spasticity appear in  Table 17  . Two hundred thirty one patients enrolled in a double-blind placebo controlled study (Study 6) received 300 Units to 400 Units of BOTOX, and were compared with 233 patients who received placebo. Patients were followed for an average of 91 days after injection.

      Upper respiratory tract infection              4 (2%)                       2 (1%)

             Cervical Dystonia  
 

 In cervical dystonia patients evaluated for safety in double-blind and open-label studies following injection of BOTOX, the most frequently reported adverse reactions were dysphagia (19%), upper respiratory infection (12%), neck pain (11%), and headache (11%).

 Other events reported in 2-10% of patients in any one study in decreasing order of incidence include: increased cough, flu syndrome, back pain, rhinitis, dizziness, hypertonia, soreness at injection site, asthenia, oral dryness, speech disorder, fever, nausea, and drowsiness. Stiffness, numbness, diplopia, ptosis, and dyspnea have been reported.

 Dysphagia and symptomatic general weakness may be attributable to an extension of the pharmacology of BOTOX resulting from the spread of the toxin outside the injected muscles  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  ,  5.6  )]  .

 The most common severe adverse reaction associated with the use of BOTOX injection in patients with cervical dystonia is dysphagia with about 20% of these cases also reporting dyspnea  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  ,  5.6  )]  . Most dysphagia is reported as mild or moderate in severity. However, it may be associated with more severe signs and symptoms  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.6  )]  .

 Additionally, reports in the literature include a case of a female patient who developed brachial plexopathy two days after injection of 120 Units of BOTOX for the treatment of cervical dystonia, and reports of dysphonia in patients who have been treated for cervical dystonia.

     Primary Axillary Hyperhidrosis  

 The most frequently reported adverse reactions (3-10% of adult patients) following injection of BOTOX in double-blind studies included injection site pain and hemorrhage, non-axillary sweating, infection, pharyngitis, flu syndrome, headache, fever, neck or back pain, pruritus, and anxiety.

 The data reflect 346 patients exposed to BOTOX 50 Units and 110 patients exposed to BOTOX 75 Units in each axilla.

     Blepharospasm  

 In a study of blepharospasm patients who received an average dose per eye of 33 Units (injected at 3 to 5 sites) of the currently manufactured BOTOX, the most frequently reported adverse reactions were ptosis (21%), superficial punctate keratitis (6%), and eye dryness (6%).

 Other events reported in prior clinical studies in decreasing order of incidence include: irritation, tearing, lagophthalmos, photophobia, ectropion, keratitis, diplopia, entropion, diffuse skin rash, and local swelling of the eyelid skin lasting for several days following eyelid injection.

 In two cases of VII nerve disorder, reduced blinking from BOTOX injection of the orbicularis muscle led to serious corneal exposure, persistent epithelial defect, corneal ulceration and a case of corneal perforation. Focal facial paralysis, syncope, and exacerbation of myasthenia gravis have also been reported after treatment of blepharospasm.

     Strabismus  

 Extraocular muscles adjacent to the injection site can be affected, causing vertical deviation, especially with higher doses of BOTOX. The incidence rates of these adverse effects in 2058 adults who received a total of 3650 injections for horizontal strabismus was 17%.

 The incidence of ptosis has been reported to be dependent on the location of the injected muscles, 1% after inferior rectus injections, 16% after horizontal rectus injections and 38% after superior rectus injections.

 In a series of 5587 injections, retrobulbar hemorrhage occurred in 0.3% of cases.

   6.2 Immunogenicity

  As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to onabotulinumtoxinA in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading.

 In a long term, open-label study evaluating 326 cervical dystonia patients treated for an average of 9 treatment sessions with the current formulation of BOTOX, 4 (1.2%) patients had positive antibody tests. All 4 of these patients responded to BOTOX therapy at the time of the positive antibody test. However, 3 of these patients developed clinical resistance after subsequent treatment, while the fourth patient continued to respond to BOTOX therapy for the remainder of the study.

 One patient among the 445 hyperhidrosis patients (0.2%), two patients among the 380 adult upper limb spasticity patients (0.5%) and no patients among 406 migraine patients with analyzed specimens developed the presence of neutralizing antibodies.

 In overactive bladder patients with analyzed specimens from the two phase 3 studies and the open-label extension study, neutralizing antibodies developed in 0 of 954 patients (0.0%) while receiving BOTOX 100 Unit doses and 3 of 260 patients (1.2%) after subsequently receiving at least one 150 Unit dose. Response to subsequent BOTOX treatment was not different following seroconversion in these three patients.

 In detrusor overactivity associated with neurologic condition patients with analyzed specimens in the drug development program (including the open-label extension study), neutralizing antibodies developed in 3 of 300 patients (1.0%) after receiving only BOTOX 200 Unit doses and 5 of 258 patients (1.9%) after receiving at least one 300 Unit dose. Following development of neutralizing antibodies in these 8 patients, 4 continued to experience clinical benefit, 2 did not experience clinical benefit, and the effect on the response to BOTOX in the remaining 2 patients is not known.

 The data reflect the patients whose test results were considered positive for neutralizing activity to BOTOX in a mouse protection assay or negative based on a screening ELISA assay or mouse protection assay.

 Formation of neutralizing antibodies to botulinum toxin type A may reduce the effectiveness of BOTOX treatment by inactivating the biological activity of the toxin. The critical factors for neutralizing antibody formation have not been well characterized. The results from some studies suggest that BOTOX injections at more frequent intervals or at higher doses may lead to greater incidence of antibody formation. The potential for antibody formation may be minimized by injecting with the lowest effective dose given at the longest feasible intervals between injections.

   6.3 Post-Marketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of BOTOX. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions include: abdominal pain; alopecia, including madarosis; anorexia; brachial plexopathy; denervation/muscle atrophy; diarrhea; hyperhidrosis; hypoacusis; hypoaesthesia; malaise; paresthesia; peripheral neuropathy; radiculopathy; erythema multiforme, dermatitis psoriasiform, and psoriasiform eruption; strabismus; tinnitus; and visual disturbances.

 There have been spontaneous reports of death, sometimes associated with dysphagia, pneumonia, and/or other significant debility or anaphylaxis, after treatment with botulinum toxin  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.4  ,  5.6  )].  

 There have also been reports of adverse events involving the cardiovascular system, including arrhythmia and myocardial infarction, some with fatal outcomes. Some of these patients had risk factors including cardiovascular disease. The exact relationship of these events to the botulinum toxin injection has not been established.

 New onset or recurrent seizures have also been reported, typically in patients who are predisposed to experiencing these events. The exact relationship of these events to the botulinum toxin injection has not been established.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: DISTANT SPREAD OF TOXIN EFFECT

  WARNING: DISTANT SPREAD OF TOXIN EFFECT



    Postmarketing reports indicate that the effects of BOTOX and all botulinum toxin products may spread from the area of injection to produce symptoms consistent with botulinum toxin effects. These may include asthenia, generalized muscle weakness, diplopia, ptosis, dysphagia, dysphonia, dysarthria, urinary incontinence and breathing difficulties. These symptoms have been reported hours to weeks after injection. Swallowing and breathing difficulties can be life threatening and there have been reports of death. The risk of symptoms is probably greatest in children treated for spasticity but symptoms can also occur in adults treated for spasticity and other conditions, particularly in those patients who have an underlying

    condition that

    would predispose them to these symptoms. In unapproved uses, including spasticity in children, and in approved indications, cases of spread of effect have been reported at doses comparable to those used to treat cervical dystonia and spasticity and at lower doses.

    [See Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )]

   5.1 Lack of Interchangeability between Botulinum Toxin Products

  The potency Units of BOTOX are specific to the preparation and assay method utilized. They are not interchangeable with other preparations of botulinum toxin products and, therefore, units of biological activity of BOTOX cannot be compared to nor converted into units of any other botulinum toxin products assessed with any other specific assay method [see Description (  11  )]  .

    5.2 Spread of Toxin Effect

  Postmarketing safety data from BOTOX and other approved botulinum toxins suggest that botulinum toxin effects may, in some cases, be observed beyond the site of local injection. The symptoms are consistent with the mechanism of action of botulinum toxin and may include asthenia, generalized muscle weakness, diplopia, ptosis, dysphagia, dysphonia, dysarthria, urinary incontinence, and breathing difficulties. These symptoms have been reported hours to weeks after injection. Swallowing and breathing difficulties can be life threatening and there have been reports of death related to spread of toxin effects. The risk of symptoms is probably greatest in children treated for spasticity but symptoms can also occur in adults treated for spasticity and other conditions, and particularly in those patients who have an underlying condition that would predispose them to these symptoms. In unapproved uses, including spasticity in children, and in approved indications, symptoms consistent with spread of toxin effect have been reported at doses comparable to or lower than doses used to treat cervical dystonia and spasticity. Patients or caregivers should be advised to seek immediate medical care if swallowing, speech or respiratory disorders occur.

 No definitive serious adverse event reports of distant spread of toxin effect associated with BOTOX for blepharospasm at the recommended dose (30 Units and below), severe primary axillary hyperhidrosis at the recommended dose (100 Units), strabismus, or for chronic migraine at the labeled doses have been reported.

    5.3 Serious Adverse Reactions with Unapproved Use

  Serious adverse reactions, including excessive weakness, dysphagia, and aspiration pneumonia, with some adverse reactions associated with fatal outcomes, have been reported in patients who received BOTOX injections for unapproved uses. In these cases, the adverse reactions were not necessarily related to distant spread of toxin, but may have resulted from the administration of BOTOX to the site of injection and/or adjacent structures. In several of the cases, patients had pre-existing dysphagia or other significant disabilities. There is insufficient information to identify factors associated with an increased risk for adverse reactions associated with the unapproved uses of BOTOX. The safety and effectiveness of BOTOX for unapproved uses have not been established.

    5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions

  Serious and/or immediate hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. These reactions include anaphylaxis, serum sickness, urticaria, soft tissue edema, and dyspnea. If such a reaction occurs, further injection of BOTOX should be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy immediately instituted. One fatal case of anaphylaxis has been reported in which lidocaine was used as the diluent, and consequently the causal agent cannot be reliably determined.

       5.5 Increased Risk of Clinically Significant Effects with Pre-Existing Neuromuscular Disorders

     Individuals with peripheral motor neuropathic diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or neuromuscular junction disorders (e.g., myasthenia gravis or Lambert-Eaton syndrome) should be monitored when given botulinum toxin. Patients with known or unrecognized neuromuscular disorders or neuromuscular junction disorders may be at increased risk of clinically significant effects including generalized muscle weakness, diplopia, ptosis, dysphonia, dysarthria, severe dysphagia and respiratory compromise from therapeutic doses of BOTOX [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  ,  5.6  )].  

    5.6 Dysphagia and Breathing Difficulties

  Treatment with BOTOX and other botulinum toxin products can result in swallowing or breathing difficulties. Patients with pre-existing swallowing or breathing difficulties may be more susceptible to these complications. In most cases, this is a consequence of weakening of muscles in the area of injection that are involved in breathing or oropharyngeal muscles that control swallowing or breathing [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )].  

 Deaths as a complication of severe dysphagia have been reported after treatment with botulinum toxin. Dysphagia may persist for several months, and require use of a feeding tube to maintain adequate nutrition and hydration. Aspiration may result from severe dysphagia and is a particular risk when treating patients in whom swallowing or respiratory function is already compromised.

 Treatment with botulinum toxins may weaken neck muscles that serve as accessory muscles of ventilation. This may result in a critical loss of breathing capacity in patients with respiratory disorders who may have become dependent upon these accessory muscles. There have been postmarketing reports of serious breathing difficulties, including respiratory failure.

 Patients with smaller neck muscle mass and patients who require bilateral injections into the sternocleidomastoid muscle for the treatment of cervical dystonia have been reported to be at greater risk for dysphagia. Limiting the dose injected into the sternocleidomastoid muscle may reduce the occurrence of dysphagia. Injections into the levator scapulae may be associated with an increased risk of upper respiratory infection and dysphagia.

 Patients treated with botulinum toxin may require immediate medical attention should they develop problems with swallowing, speech or respiratory disorders. These reactions can occur within hours to weeks after injection with botulinum toxin [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )]  .

    5.7 Pulmonary Effects of BOTOX in Patients with Compromised Respiratory Status Treated for Spasticity or for Detrusor Overactivity associated with a Neurologic Condition

  Patients with compromised respiratory status treated with BOTOX for spasticity should be monitored closely. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study in patients treated for upper limb spasticity with stable reduced pulmonary function (defined as FEV140-80% of predicted value and FEV1/FVC &lt;= 0.75), the event rate in change of Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) &gt;=15% or &gt;=20% was generally greater in patients treated with BOTOX than in patients treated with placebo (see  Table 5  ).

 Table 5: Event Rate Per Patient Treatment Cycle Among Patients with Reduced Lung Function Who Experienced at Least a 15% or 20% Decrease in FVC From Baseline at Week 1, 6, 12 Post-injection with Up to Two Treatment Cycles with BOTOX or Placebo 
                  BOTOX   360 Units     BOTOX   240 Units     Placebo         
 &gt;=15%           &gt;=20%           &gt;=15%           &gt;=20%           &gt;=15%           &gt;=20%            
 Week 1          4%              0%              3%              0%              7%              3%               
 Week 6          7%              4%              4%              2%              2%              2%               
 Week 12         10%             5%              2%              1%              4%              1%               
             Differences from placebo were not statistically significant
 

 In spasticity patients with reduced lung function, upper respiratory tract infections were also reported more frequently as adverse reactions in patients treated with BOTOX than in patients treated with placebo [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.10  )]  .

 In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study in adult patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurologic condition and restrictive lung disease of neuromuscular etiology [defined as FVC 50-80% of predicted value in patients with spinal cord injury between C5 and C8, or MS] the event rate in change of Forced Vital Capacity &gt;=15% or &gt;=20% was generally greater in patients treated with BOTOX than in patients treated with placebo (see  Table 6  ).

              5.8 Corneal Exposure and Ulceration in Patients Treated with BOTOX for Blepharospasm
 

  Reduced blinking from BOTOX injection of the orbicularis muscle can lead to corneal exposure, persistent epithelial defect, and corneal ulceration, especially in patients with VII nerve disorders. Vigorous treatment of any epithelial defect should be employed. This may require protective drops, ointment, therapeutic soft contact lenses, or closure of the eye by patching or other means.

    5.9 Retrobulbar Hemorrhages in Patients Treated with BOTOX for Strabismus

  During the administration of BOTOX for the treatment of strabismus, retrobulbar hemorrhages sufficient to compromise retinal circulation have occurred. It is recommended that appropriate instruments to decompress the orbit be accessible.

    5.10 Bronchitis and Upper Respiratory Tract Infections in Patients Treated for Spasticity

  Bronchitis was reported more frequently as an adverse reaction in patients treated for upper limb spasticity with BOTOX (3% at 251 Units-360 Units total dose), compared to placebo (1%). In patients with reduced lung function treated for upper limb spasticity, upper respiratory tract infections were also reported more frequently as adverse reactions in patients treated with BOTOX (11% at 360 Units total dose; 8% at 240 Units total dose) compared to placebo (6%). In adult patients treated for lower limb spasticity, upper respiratory tract infections were reported more frequently as an adverse event in patients treated with BOTOX (2% at 300 Units to 400 Units total dose) compared to placebo (1%).

    5.11 Autonomic Dysreflexia in Patients Treated for Detrusor Overactivity associated with a Neurologic Condition

  Autonomic dysreflexia associated with intradetrusor injections of BOTOX could occur in patients treated for detrusor overactivity associated with a neurologic condition and may require prompt medical therapy. In clinical trials, the incidence of autonomic dysreflexia was greater in patients treated with BOTOX 200 Units compared with placebo (1.5% versus 0.4%, respectively).

    5.12 Urinary Tract Infections in Patients with Overactive Bladder

  BOTOX increases the incidence of urinary tract infection [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . Clinical trials for overactive bladder excluded patients with more than 2 UTIs in the past 6 months and those taking antibiotics chronically due to recurrent UTIs. Use of BOTOX for the treatment of overactive bladder in such patients and in patients with multiple recurrent UTIs during treatment should only be considered when the benefit is likely to outweigh the potential risk.

    5.13 Urinary Retention in Patients Treated for Bladder Dysfunction

  Due to the risk of urinary retention, treat only patients who are willing and able to initiate catheterization post-treatment, if required, for urinary retention.

 In patients who are not catheterizing, post-void residual (PVR) urine volume should be assessed within 2 weeks post-treatment and periodically as medically appropriate up to 12 weeks, particularly in patients with multiple sclerosis or diabetes mellitus. Depending on patient symptoms, institute catheterization if PVR urine volume exceeds 200 mL and continue until PVR falls below 200 mL. Instruct patients to contact their physician if they experience difficulty in voiding as catheterization may be required.

 The incidence and duration of urinary retention is described below for patients with overactive bladder and detrusor overactivity associated with a neurologic condition who received BOTOX or placebo injections.

    Overactive Bladder  

 In double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with OAB, the proportion of subjects who initiated clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) for urinary retention following treatment with BOTOX or placebo is shown in  Table 7  . The duration of post-injection catheterization for those who developed urinary retention is also shown.

              Detrusor Overactivity associated with a Neurologic Condition  
 

 In two double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurologic condition (NDO-1 and NDO-2), the proportion of subjects who were not using clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) prior to injection and who subsequently required catheterization for urinary retention following treatment with BOTOX 200 Units or placebo is shown in  Table 9  . The duration of post-injection catheterization for those who developed urinary retention is also shown.

              A placebo-controlled, double-blind post-approval 52 week study with BOTOX 100 Units (Study NDO-3) was conducted in non-catheterizing MS patients with urinary incontinence due to detrusor overactivity associated with a neurologic condition. Catheterization for urinary retention was initiated in 15.2% (10/66) of patients following treatment with BOTOX 100 Units versus 2.6% (2/78) on placebo at any time during the complete treatment cycle. The median duration of post-injection catheterization for those who developed urinary retention was 64 days for BOTOX 100 Units and 2 days for placebo.
 

       5.14 Human Albumin and Transmission of Viral Diseases

     This product contains albumin, a derivative of human blood. Based on effective donor screening and product manufacturing processes, it carries an extremely remote risk for transmission of viral diseases and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). There is a theoretical risk for transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), but if that risk actually exists, the risk of transmission would also be considered extremely remote. No cases of transmission of viral diseases, CJD or vCJD have ever been identified for licensed albumin or albumin contained in other licensed products.
