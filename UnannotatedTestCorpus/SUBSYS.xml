  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The safety of SUBSYS has been evaluated in a total of 359 opioid-tolerant patients with breakthrough cancer pain. The duration of SUBSYS use varied during the open-label study. Safety data from a long-term extension study showed that the average duration of therapy in the open-label study was 66 days. The maximum duration of therapy was 149 days. The dose range studied in these trials ranged from 100 mcg per dose to 1600 mcg per dose.



 The most serious adverse reactions associated with all opioids including SUBSYS are respiratory depression (potentially leading to apnea or respiratory arrest), circulatory depression, hypotension, and shock. Follow all patients for symptoms of respiratory depression.



 The most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation of SUBSYS was nausea. There were also adverse reactions of abdominal distension, anorexia, confusional state, disorientation, somnolence, and constipation.



 The clinical trials of SUBSYS were designed to evaluate safety and efficacy in treating breakthrough cancer pain; all patients were also taking concomitant opioids, such as sustained-release morphine or transdermal fentanyl, for their persistent cancer pain. The adverse event data presented here reflect the actual percentage of patients experiencing each adverse effect among patients who received SUBSYS for breakthrough cancer pain along with a concomitant opioid for persistent cancer pain.



   Table 4  lists adverse reactions with an overall frequency of 5% or greater that occurred during titration in the clinical trials. Adverse reactions are listed in descending order of frequency within each system organ class.

 In a single-dose mucositis study, a group of patients with Grade 1 or 2 oral mucositis (n=9) and without oral mucositis (n=9) were included in a clinical trial designed to support the safety of SUBSYS. Two of the nine subjects with mucositis (one with Grade 1 and one with Grade 2) reported a burning sensation in the oral mucosa after treatment. Both of these events were considered mild and probably related to treatment. There was no change in grade of mucositis after treatment for any subject.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of fentanyl. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Serotonin syndrome:  Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs.



   Adrenal insufficiency:  Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use.



   Anaphylaxis:  Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in SUBSYS.



   Androgen deficiency:  Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with chronic use of opioids  [see Clinical Pharmacology (  12.2  )]  .

  WARNING: LIFE THREATENTING RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION; ACCIDENTAL EXPOSURE, CYTOCHROME P450 3A4 INTERACTION; RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH BENZODIAZEPINES OR OTHER CNS DEPRESSANTS; RISK OF MEDICATION ERRORS; ADDICTION, ABUSE, AND MISUSE; REMS; and NEONATAL OPIOID WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME

    Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression    Serious, life-threatening, and/or fatal respiratory depression has occurred in patients treated with SUBSYS, including following use in opioid non-tolerant patients and improper dosing.  Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of SUBSYS or following a dose increase. The substitution of SUBSYS for any other fentanyl product may result in fatal overdose   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )]    



   Due to the risk of respiratory depression, SUBSYS is contraindicated in the management of acute or postoperative pain including headache/migraine and in opioid non-tolerant patients.   [see Contraindications (  4  )]    



   Accidental INGESTION    Accidental ingestion of even one dose of SUBSYS especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of fentanyl   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2   )]  .  



   Death has been reported in children who have accidentally ingested transmucosal immediate-release fentanyl products. SUBSYS must be kept out of reach of children   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  ); How Supplied/Storage and Handling (  16  )].    



   Cytochrome P450 3A4 Interaction     The concomitant use of SUBSYS with all cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse reactions and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. In addition, discontinuation of a concomitantly used cytochrome P450 3A4 inducer may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentration. Monitor patients receiving SUBSYS and any CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  ), Drug Interactions (  7  ), Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )]  .  



   Risks From Concomitant Use With Benzodiazepines Or Other CNS Depressants    Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.4  ), Drug Interactions (  7  )].    



 *  Reserve concomitant prescribing of SUBSYS and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. 
 *  Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. 
 *  Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. 
      Risk of Medication Errors    Substantial differences exist in the pharmacokinetic profile of SUBSYS compared to other fentanyl products that result in clinically important differences in the extent of absorption of fentanyl that could result in fatal overdose   [see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  ), Warnings and Precautions (  5.5  )]  .   
 

 *  When prescribing, do not convert patients on a mcg per mcg basis from any other fentanyl products to SUBSYS. 
 *  When dispensing, do not substitute a SUBSYS prescription for other fentanyl products. 
      Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse     SUBSYS exposes patients and other users to the risks of opioid addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess each patient's risk prior to prescribing SUBSYS, and monitor all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors and conditions   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.6  )]  .   
 

   Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Access Program    Because of the risk for misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose, SUBSYS is available only through a restricted program required by the Food and Drug Administration, called a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). Under the Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) REMS Access program, outpatients, healthcare professionals who prescribe to outpatients, pharmacies, and distributors must enroll in the program.   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.7  )].   Further information is available at www.TIRFREMSaccess.com or by calling 1-866-822-1483.  



   Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome    Prolonged use of SUBSYS during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts.  If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [  see Warnings and Precautions (  5.8  )  ].

   5.1 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression



  Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see Overdosage (  10  )]  . Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.



 While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of SUBSYS, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24-72 hours of initiating therapy with and following dosage increases of SUBSYS.



 To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of SUBSYS are essential [see Dosage and Administration (  2.4  )]  . Overestimating the SUBSYS dosage can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose. The substitution of SUBSYS for any other fentanyl product may result in fatal overdose [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.5  )].  



 SUBSYS could be fatal to individuals for whom it is not prescribed and for those who are not opioid-tolerant.



 Accidental ingestion or exposure to even one dose of SUBSYS, especially in children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of fentanyl.



    5.2 Increased Risk of Overdose in Children Due to Accidental Ingestion



  Death has been reported in children who have accidentally ingested transmucosal immediate-release fentanyl products.



 Patients and their caregivers must be informed that SUBSYS contains a medicine in an amount which can be fatal to a child. Physicians and dispensing pharmacists must specifically question patients or caregivers about the presence of children in the home (on a full time or visiting basis) and counsel them regarding the dangers to children from inadvertent exposure.



 Patients and their caregivers must be instructed to keep both used and unused dosage units out of the reach of children. While all units should be disposed of immediately after use, partially consumed units represent a special risk to children. In the event that a unit is not completely consumed it must be properly disposed as soon as possible [ see Patient Counseling Information (  17  )  ].



 Detailed instructions for the proper storage, administration, disposal, and important instructions for managing an overdose of SUBSYS are provided in the SUBSYS Medication Guide. Encourage patients to read this information in its entirety and give them an opportunity to have their questions answered.



    5.3 Risks of Concomitant Use or Discontinuation of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers



  Concomitant use of SUBSYS with a CYP3A4 inhibitor, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may increase plasma concentrations of fentanyl and prolong opioid adverse reactions, which may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression [ see Warnings and Precautions (  5.9  )  ], particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of SUBSYS is achieved. Similarly, discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inducer, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, in SUBSYS-treated patients may increase fentanyl plasma concentrations and prolong opioid adverse reactions. When using SUBSYS with CYP3A4 inhibitors or discontinuing CYP3A4 inducers in SUBSYS-treated patients, monitor patients closely at frequent intervals and consider dosage reduction of SUBSYS until stable drug effects are achieved [see Drug Interactions (  7  )]  .



 Concomitant use of SUBSYS with CYP3A4 inducers or discontinuation of an CYP3A4 inhibitor could decrease fentanyl plasma concentrations, decrease opioid efficacy or, possibly, lead to a withdrawal syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to fentanyl. When using SUBSYS with CYP3A4 inducers or discontinuing CYP3A4 inhibitors, monitor patients closely at frequent intervals and consider increasing the opioid dosage if needed to maintain adequate analgesia or if symptoms of opioid withdrawal occur [ see Drug Interactions (  7  )]  .



    5.4 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants



   Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of SUBSYS with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.  



  Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions (  7  )]  .  



  If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.  



  Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when SUBSYS is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [see Drug Interactions (  7  ) and Patient Counseling Information (  17  )].    



    5.5 Risk of Medication Errors



  When prescribing, DO NOT convert a patient to SUBSYS from any other fentanyl product on a mcg per mcg basis as SUBSYS and other fentanyl products are not equivalent on a microgram per microgram basis.



 SUBSYS is NOT a generic version of other transmucosal immediate release fentanyl (TIRF) formulations. When dispensing, DO NOT substitute a SUBSYS prescription for any other TIRF formulation under any circumstances. Other TIRF formulations and SUBSYS are not equivalent. Substantial differences exist in the pharmacokinetic profile of SUBSYS compared to other fentanyl products including other TIRF formulations that result in clinically important differences in the rate and extent of absorption of fentanyl. As a result of these differences, the substitution of SUBSYS for any other fentanyl product may result in a fatal overdose.



 There are no safe conversion directions available for patients on any other fentanyl products (Note: This includes oral, transdermal, or parenteral formulations of fentanyl.) [see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  )]  . Therefore, for opioid tolerant patients, the initial dose of SUBSYS should always be ONE 100 mcg spray. Individually titrate each patient's dose to provide adequate analgesia while minimizing side effects [see Dosage and Administration (  2.3  )]  .



    5.6 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse



  SUBSYS contains fentanyl, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, SUBSYS exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (  9  )].  



 Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed SUBSYS. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused.



 Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing SUBSYS, and monitor all patients receiving SUBSYS for the development of these behaviors or conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as SUBSYS, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of SUBSYS along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse.



 Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing SUBSYS. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see Patient Counseling Information (  17  )].

  Because of the risk of misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )]  , SUBSYS is available only through a restricted program under a REMS called the TIRF REMS Access program. Under the TIRF REMS Access program, outpatients, healthcare professionals who prescribe to outpatients, pharmacies, and distributors must enroll in the program. For inpatient administration (e.g. hospitals, hospices, and long-term care facilities that prescribe for inpatient use) of SUBSYS, patient and prescriber enrollment is not required.



 Required components of the TIRF REMS Access program are:



 *  Healthcare professionals who prescribe SUBSYS must review the prescriber educational materials for the TIRF REMS Access program, enroll in the program, and comply with the REMS requirements. 
 *  To receive SUBSYS, outpatients must understand the risks and benefits and sign a Patient-Prescriber Agreement. 
 *  Pharmacies that dispense SUBSYS must enroll in the program and agree to comply with the REMS requirements. 
 *  Wholesalers and distributers that distribute SUBSYS must enroll in the program and distribute only to authorized pharmacies. 
 *  Further information, including a list of qualified pharmacies/distributors, is available at www.tirfremsaccess.com or by calling 1-866-822-1483. 
       5.8 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome
 

  Prolonged use of SUBSYS during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  ), Patient Counseling Information (  17  )].  



    5.9 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients



  The use of SUBSYS in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated.



  Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease:  SUBSYS treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of SUBSYS [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )]  .



  Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients:  Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )]  .



 Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating SUBSYS and when SUBSYS is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.9  )]  . Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients.



    5.10 Serotonin Syndrome with Concomitant Use of Serotonergic Drugs



  Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of SUBSYS with serotonergic drugs. Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including MAO inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue) [see Drug Interactions (  7  )]  . This may occur within the recommended dosage range.



 Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days of concomitant use, but may occur later than that. Discontinue SUBSYS if serotonin syndrome is suspected.



    5.11 Adrenal Insufficiency



  Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.



    5.12 Severe Hypotension



  SUBSYS may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g. phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (  7  )]  . Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of SUBSYS. In patients with circulatory shock, SUBSYS may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of SUBSYS in patients with circulatory shock.



    5.13 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness



  In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), SUBSYS may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with SUBSYS.



 Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of SUBSYS in patients with impaired consciousness or coma.



    5.14 Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions



  SUBSYS is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus.



 The fentanyl in SUBSYS may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsening symptoms.



    5.15 Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders



  The fentanyl in SUBSYS may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during SUBSYS therapy.



    5.16 Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery



  SUBSYS may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of SUBSYS and know how they will react to the medication.



    5.17 Cardiac Disease



  Intravenous fentanyl may produce bradycardia. Therefore, use SUBSYS with caution in patients with bradyarrhythmias.
