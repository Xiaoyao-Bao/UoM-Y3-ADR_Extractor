  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     Ertugliflozin and Sitagliptin  



 The safety of concomitantly administered ertugliflozin and sitagliptin has been evaluated in 990 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated for 26 weeks in three studies; a factorial study of ertugliflozin 5 mg or 15 mg in combination with sitagliptin 100 mg once daily compared to the individual components, a placebo-controlled study of ertugliflozin 5 mg or 15 mg as add-on therapy to sitagliptin 100 mg and metformin once daily, and a placebo-controlled study of initial therapy with ertugliflozin 5 mg or 15 mg once daily in combination with sitagliptin 100 mg once daily  [see  Clinical Studies (14)  ]  . The incidence and type of adverse reactions in these three studies were similar to the adverse reactions seen with ertugliflozin and described below in Table 1.



     Ertugliflozin  



     Pool of Placebo-Controlled Trials  



 The data in Table 1 are derived from a pool of three 26-week, placebo-controlled trials. Ertugliflozin was used as monotherapy in one trial and as add-on therapy in two trials  [see  Clinical Studies (14)  ]  . These data reflect exposure of 1,029 patients to ertugliflozin with a mean exposure duration of approximately 25 weeks. Patients received ertugliflozin 5 mg (N=519), ertugliflozin 15 mg (N=510), or placebo (N=515) once daily. The mean age of the population was 57 years and 2% were older than 75 years of age. Fifty-three percent (53%) of the population was male and 73% were Caucasian, 15% were Asian, and 7% were Black or African American. At baseline the population had diabetes for an average of 7.5 years, had a mean HbA1c of 8.1%, and 19.4% had established microvascular complications of diabetes. Baseline renal function (mean eGFR 88.9 mL/min/1.73 m  2  ) was normal or mildly impaired in 97% of patients and moderately impaired in 3% of patients.



 Table 1 shows common adverse reactions associated with the use of ertugliflozin. These adverse reactions were not present at baseline, occurred more commonly on ertugliflozin than on placebo, and occurred in at least 2% of patients treated with either ertugliflozin 5 mg or ertugliflozin 15 mg.

              Volume Depletion  
 

 Ertugliflozin causes an osmotic diuresis, which may lead to intravascular volume contraction and adverse reactions related to volume depletion, particularly in patients with impaired renal function (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m  2  ). In patients with moderate renal impairment, adverse reactions related to volume depletion (e.g., dehydration, dizziness postural, presyncope, syncope, hypotension, and orthostatic hypotension) were reported in 0%, 4.4%, and 1.9% of patients treated with placebo, ertugliflozin 5 mg, and ertugliflozin 15 mg, respectively. Ertugliflozin may also increase the risk of hypotension in other patients at risk for volume contraction  [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.5  ,  8.6)  ]  .



     Ketoacidosis  



 Across the clinical program, ketoacidosis was identified in 3 of 3,409 (0.1%) ertugliflozin-treated patients and 0.0% of comparator-treated patients  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ].  



     Impairment in Renal Function  



 Treatment with ertugliflozin was associated with increases in serum creatinine and decreases in eGFR (see  Table 2  ). Patients with moderate renal impairment at baseline had larger mean changes. In a study in patients with moderate renal impairment, these abnormal laboratory findings were observed to reverse after treatment discontinuation  [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.5  ,  8.6)  ]  .

           Renal-related adverse reactions (e.g., acute kidney injury, renal impairment, acute prerenal failure) may occur in patients treated with ertugliflozin, particularly in patients with moderate renal impairment where the incidence of renal-related adverse reactions was 0.6%, 2.5%, and 1.3% in patients treated with placebo, ertugliflozin 5 mg, and ertugliflozin 15 mg, respectively.
 

     Lower Limb Amputation  



 Across seven Phase 3 clinical trials in which ertugliflozin was studied as monotherapy and in combination with other antihyperglycemic agents, non-traumatic lower limb amputations occurred in 1 of 1,450 (0.1%) in the non-ertugliflozin group, 3 of 1,716 (0.2%) in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group, and 8 of 1,693 (0.5%) in the ertugliflozin 15 mg group.



     Hypoglycemia  



 The incidence of hypoglycemia by study is shown in Table 3.

              Genital Mycotic Infections  
 

 In the pool of three placebo-controlled clinical trials, the incidence of female genital mycotic infections (e.g., genital candidiasis, genital infection fungal, vaginal infection, vulvitis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, vulvovaginal mycotic infection, vulvovaginitis) occurred in 3%, 9.1%, and 12.2% of females treated with placebo, ertugliflozin 5 mg, and ertugliflozin 15 mg, respectively (see  Table 1  ). In females, discontinuation due to genital mycotic infections occurred in 0% and 0.6% of patients treated with placebo and ertugliflozin, respectively.



 In the same pool, male genital mycotic infections (e.g., balanitis candida, balanoposthitis, genital infection, genital infection fungal) occurred in 0.4%, 3.7%, and 4.2% of males treated with placebo, ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg, respectively (see  Table 1  ). Male genital mycotic infections occurred more commonly in uncircumcised males. In males, discontinuations due to genital mycotic infections occurred in 0% and 0.2% of patients treated with placebo and ertugliflozin, respectively. Phimosis was reported in 8 of 1,729 (0.5%) male ertugliflozin-treated patients, of which four required circumcision.



     Sitagliptin  



 The following additional adverse reactions have been reported in clinical studies with sitagliptin: upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, headache, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea. In addition, in a study of sitagliptin as add-on combination therapy with metformin and rosiglitazone, peripheral edema was noted with a higher incidence than placebo.



 In a pooled analysis of the two monotherapy studies, the add-on to metformin study, and the add-on to pioglitazone study, the overall incidence of adverse reactions of hypoglycemia was 1.2% in patients treated with sitagliptin 100 mg and 0.9% in patients treated with placebo. In the add-on to sulfonylurea and add-on to insulin studies, hypoglycemia was also more commonly reported in patients treated with sitagliptin compared to placebo. In the add-on to glimepiride (+/- metformin) study, the overall incidence of hypoglycemia was 12.2% in patients treated with sitagliptin 100 mg and 1.8% in patients treated with placebo. In the add-on to insulin (+/- metformin) study, the overall incidence of hypoglycemia was 15.5% in patients treated with sitagliptin 100 mg and 7.8% in patients treated with placebo. In all studies, adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of symptomatic hypoglycemia. A concurrent blood glucose measurement was not required although most (74%) reports of hypoglycemia were accompanied by a blood glucose measurement &lt;=70 mg/dL.



 In a pooled analysis of 19 double-blind clinical trials that included data from 10,246 patients randomized to receive sitagliptin 100 mg/day (N=5,429) or corresponding (active or placebo) control (N=4,817), the incidence of non-adjudicated acute pancreatitis events was 0.1 per 100 patient-years in each group (4 patients with an event in 4,708 patient-years for sitagliptin and 4 patients with an event in 3,942 patient-years for control).



     Laboratory Tests  



     Ertugliflozin  



     Increases in Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C)  



 In the pool of three placebo-controlled trials, dose-related increases in LDL-C were observed in patients treated with ertugliflozin. Mean percent changes from baseline to Week 26 in LDL-C relative to placebo were 2.6% and 5.4% with ertugliflozin 5 mg and ertugliflozin 15 mg, respectively. The range of mean baseline LDL-C was 96.6 to 97.7 mg/dL across treatment groups  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.12)  ].  



     Increases in Hemoglobin  



 In the pool of three placebo-controlled trials, mean changes (percent changes) from baseline to Week 26 in hemoglobin were -0.21 g/dL (-1.4%) with placebo, 0.46 g/dL (3.5%) with ertugliflozin 5 mg, and 0.48 g/dL (3.5%) with ertugliflozin 15 mg. The range of mean baseline hemoglobin was 13.90 to 14.00 g/dL across treatment groups. At the end of treatment, 0.0%, 0.2%, and 0.4% of patients treated with placebo, ertugliflozin 5 mg, and ertugliflozin 15 mg, respectively, had a hemoglobin increase greater than 2 g/dL and above the upper limit of normal.



     Increases in Serum Phosphate  



 In the pool of three placebo-controlled trials, mean changes (percent changes) from baseline in serum phosphate were 0.04 mg/dL (1.9%) with placebo, 0.21 mg/dL (6.8%) with ertugliflozin 5 mg, and 0.26 mg/dL (8.5%) with ertugliflozin 15 mg. The range of mean baseline serum phosphate was 3.53 to 3.54 mg/dL across treatment groups. In a clinical trial of patients with moderate renal impairment, mean changes (percent changes) from baseline at Week 26 in serum phosphate were -0.01 mg/dL (0.8%) with placebo, 0.29 mg/dL (9.7%) with ertugliflozin 5 mg, and 0.24 mg/dL (7.8%) with ertugliflozin 15 mg.



     Sitagliptin  



 Across clinical studies, the incidence of laboratory adverse reactions was similar in patients treated with sitagliptin 100 mg compared to patients treated with placebo. A small increase in white blood cell count (WBC) was observed due to an increase in neutrophils. This increase in WBC (of approximately 200 cells/microL vs. placebo, in four pooled placebo-controlled clinical studies, with a mean baseline WBC count of approximately 6,600 cells/microL) is not considered to be clinically relevant. In a 12-week study of 91 patients with chronic renal insufficiency, 37 patients with moderate renal insufficiency were randomized to sitagliptin 50 mg daily, while 14 patients with the same magnitude of renal impairment were randomized to placebo. Mean (SE) increases in serum creatinine were observed in patients treated with sitagliptin [0.12 mg/dL (0.04)] and in patients treated with placebo [0.07 mg/dL (0.07)]. The clinical significance of this added increase in serum creatinine relative to placebo is not known.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

    Sitagliptin  



 Additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sitagliptin, a component of STEGLUJAN, as monotherapy and/or in combination with other antihyperglycemic agents. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, urticaria, cutaneous vasculitis, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.11)  ]  ; hepatic enzyme elevations; acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis  [see  Indications and Usage (1)  and  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  ; worsening renal function, including acute renal failure (sometimes requiring dialysis)  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.4)  ]  ; severe and disabling arthralgia  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.13)  ]  ; bullous pemphigoid  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.14)  ];  constipation; vomiting; headache; myalgia; pain in extremity; back pain; pruritus; mouth ulceration; stomatitis.



     Ertugliflozin  



 Additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 *  Cases of necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier's gangrene) have been seen with SGLT2 inhibitors [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.9)  ]  
</Section>
    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *   Pancreatitis: There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis in patients taking sitagliptin, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue. (  5.1  ) 
 *   Hypotension: May occur particularly in patients with renal impairment, the elderly, or patients on diuretics. Before initiating assess and correct volume status. Monitor for signs and symptoms during therapy. (  5.2  ) 
 *   Ketoacidosis: Assess patients who present with signs and symptoms of metabolic acidosis for ketoacidosis, regardless of blood glucose level. If suspected, discontinue, evaluate and treat promptly. Before initiating, consider risk factors for ketoacidosis. Patients may require monitoring and temporary discontinuation of therapy in clinical situations known to predispose to ketoacidosis. (  5.3  ) 
 *   Acute Kidney Injury and Impairment in Renal Function: Consider temporarily discontinuing in settings of reduced oral intake or fluid losses. If acute kidney injury occurs, discontinue and promptly treat. There have been postmarketing reports of acute renal failure in patients taking sitagliptin, sometimes requiring dialysis. Monitor renal function. (  5.4  ) 
 *   Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis: Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated. (  5.5  ) 
 *   Lower Limb Amputation: Before initiating, consider factors that may increase risk of amputation. Monitor patients for infections or ulcers of lower limbs, and discontinue if these occur. (  5.6  ) 
 *   Heart Failure: Heart failure has been observed with two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. Consider risks and benefits in patients who have known risk factors for heart failure. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms. (  5.7  ) 
 *   Hypoglycemia: Consider a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue to reduce risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination. (  5.8  ) 
 *   Necrotizing Fasciitis of the Perineum (Fournier's gangrene): Serious, life-threatening cases have occurred in both females and males. Assess patients presenting with pain or tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, along with fever or malaise. If suspected, institute prompt treatment. (  5.9  ) 
 *   Genital Mycotic Infections: Monitor and treat if indicated. (  5.10  ) 
 *   Hypersensitivity: There have been postmarketing reports of serious allergic and hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with sitagliptin such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. In such cases, promptly discontinue, assess for other potential causes, institute appropriate monitoring and treatment, and initiate alternative treatment for diabetes. (  5.11  ) 
 *   Increased LDL-C: Monitor and treat as appropriate. (  5.12  ) 
 *   Severe and Disabling Arthralgia: Severe and disabling arthralgia has been reported in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Consider as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue if appropriate. (  5.13  ) 
 *   Pemphigoid: There have been postmarketing reports of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, discontinue. (  5.14  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Pancreatitis



  There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, in patients taking sitagliptin, a component of STEGLUJAN. After initiation of STEGLUJAN, patients should be observed carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, STEGLUJAN should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using STEGLUJAN.



    5.2 Hypotension



  Ertugliflozin, a component of STEGLUJAN, causes intravascular volume contraction. Therefore, symptomatic hypotension may occur after initiating STEGLUJAN [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  particularly in patients with impaired renal function (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m  2  ) [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.6)  ]  , elderly patients (&gt;=65 years), in patients with low systolic blood pressure, and in patients on diuretics. Before initiating STEGLUJAN, volume status should be assessed and corrected if indicated. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension after initiating therapy.



    5.3 Ketoacidosis



  Reports of ketoacidosis, a serious life-threatening condition requiring urgent hospitalization, have been identified in clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving medicines containing sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and cases have been reported in ertugliflozin-treated patients in clinical trials. Across the clinical program, ketoacidosis was identified in 3 of 3,409 (0.1%) of ertugliflozin-treated patients and 0% of comparator-treated patients. Fatal cases of ketoacidosis have been reported in patients taking medicines containing SGLT2 inhibitors. STEGLUJAN is not indicated for the treatment of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus [see  Indications and Usage (1)  ]  .



 Patients treated with STEGLUJAN who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis should be assessed for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels, as ketoacidosis associated with STEGLUJAN may be present even if blood glucose levels are less than 250 mg/dL. If ketoacidosis is suspected, STEGLUJAN should be discontinued, patient should be evaluated, and prompt treatment should be instituted. Treatment of ketoacidosis may require insulin, fluid, and carbohydrate replacement.



 In many of the reported cases, and particularly in patients with type 1 diabetes, the presence of ketoacidosis was not immediately recognized and institution of treatment was delayed because presenting blood glucose levels were below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (often less than 250 mg/dL). Signs and symptoms at presentation were consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis and included nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. In some but not all cases, factors predisposing to ketoacidosis such as insulin dose reduction, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake due to illness or surgery, pancreatic disorders suggesting insulin deficiency (e.g., type 1 diabetes, history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery), and alcohol abuse were identified.



 Before initiating STEGLUJAN, consider factors in the patient history that may predispose to ketoacidosis, including pancreatic insulin deficiency from any cause, caloric restriction, and alcohol abuse. In patients treated with STEGLUJAN consider monitoring for ketoacidosis and temporarily discontinuing STEGLUJAN in clinical situations known to predispose to ketoacidosis (e.g., prolonged fasting due to acute illness or surgery).



    5.4 Acute Kidney Injury and Impairment in Renal Function



  STEGLUJAN causes intravascular volume contraction and can cause renal impairment [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . There have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury some requiring hospitalization and dialysis in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors.



 Before initiating STEGLUJAN, consider factors that may predispose patients to acute kidney injury including hypovolemia, chronic renal insufficiency, congestive heart failure and concomitant medications (diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, NSAIDs). Consider temporarily discontinuing STEGLUJAN in any setting of reduced oral intake (such as acute illness or fasting) or fluid losses (such as gastrointestinal illness or excessive heat exposure); monitor patients for signs and symptoms of acute kidney injury. If acute kidney injury occurs, discontinue STEGLUJAN promptly and institute treatment.



 Ertugliflozin, a component of STEGLUJAN, increases serum creatinine and decreases eGFR. Patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m  2  ) may be more susceptible to these changes. Renal function abnormalities can occur after initiating STEGLUJAN [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Renal function should be evaluated prior to initiating STEGLUJAN and periodically thereafter. Use of STEGLUJAN is not recommended when eGFR is persistently between 30 and less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m  2  and is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m  2   [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ,  Contraindications (4)  , and  Use in Specific Populations (8.6)  ]  .



 There have been postmarketing reports with sitagliptin of worsening renal function, including acute renal failure, sometimes requiring dialysis. A subset of these reports involved patients with renal insufficiency, some of whom were prescribed inappropriate doses of sitagliptin. A return to baseline levels of renal insufficiency has been observed with supportive treatment and discontinuation of potentially causative agents. Consideration can be given to cautiously reinitiating STEGLUJAN if another etiology is deemed likely to have precipitated the acute worsening of renal function.



 Sitagliptin has not been found to be nephrotoxic in preclinical studies at clinically relevant doses, or in clinical trials.



    5.5 Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis



  There have been postmarketing reports of serious urinary tract infections, including urosepsis and pyelonephritis, requiring hospitalization in patients receiving medicines containing SGLT2 inhibitors. Cases of pyelonephritis also have been reported in ertugliflozin-treated patients in clinical trials. Treatment with medicines containing SGLT2 inhibitors increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



    5.6 Lower Limb Amputation



  An increased risk for lower limb amputation (primarily of the toe) has been observed in clinical studies with another SGLT2 inhibitor. Across seven Phase 3 clinical trials in the ertugliflozin development program, non-traumatic lower limb amputations were reported in 1 (0.1%) patient in the comparator group, 3 (0.2%) patients in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group, and 8 (0.5%) patients in the ertugliflozin 15 mg group. A causal association between ertugliflozin and lower limb amputation has not been definitively established.



 Before initiating STEGLUJAN, consider factors in the patient history that may predispose them to the need for amputations, such as a history of prior amputation, peripheral vascular disease, neuropathy and diabetic foot ulcers. Counsel patients about the importance of routine preventative foot care. Monitor patients receiving STEGLUJAN for signs and symptoms of infection (including osteomyelitis), new pain or tenderness, sores or ulcers involving the lower limbs, and discontinue STEGLUJAN if these complications occur.



    5.7 Heart Failure



  An association between dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor treatment and heart failure has been observed in cardiovascular outcomes trials for two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. These trials evaluated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Consider the risks and benefits of STEGLUJAN prior to initiating treatment in patients at risk for heart failure, such as those with a prior history of heart failure and a history of renal impairment, and observe these patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure during therapy. Advise patients of the characteristic symptoms of heart failure and to immediately report such symptoms. If heart failure develops, evaluate and manage according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of STEGLUJAN.



    5.8 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues



  Insulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Ertugliflozin, a component of STEGLUJAN, may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . When sitagliptin, a component of STEGLUJAN, was used in combination with a sulfonylurea or with insulin, medications known to cause hypoglycemia, the incidence of hypoglycemia was increased over that of placebo used in combination with a sulfonylurea or with insulin. [See  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  .]  Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with STEGLUJAN.



    5.9 Necrotizing Fasciitis of the Perineum (Fournier's Gangrene)



   Reports of necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier's gangrene), a rare but serious and life-threatening necrotizing infection requiring urgent surgical intervention, have been identified in postmarketing surveillance in patients with diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors. Cases have been reported in females and males. Serious outcomes have included hospitalization, multiple surgeries, and death.  



  Patients treated with STEGLUJAN presenting with pain or tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, along with fever or malaise, should be assessed for necrotizing fasciitis. If suspected, start treatment immediately with broad-spectrum antibiotics and, if necessary, surgical debridement. Discontinue STEGLUJAN, closely monitor blood glucose levels, and provide appropriate alternative therapy for glycemic control.  



    5.10 Genital Mycotic Infections



  Ertugliflozin, a component of STEGLUJAN, increases the risk of genital mycotic infections. Patients who have a history of genital mycotic infections or who are uncircumcised are more likely to develop genital mycotic infections [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Monitor and treat appropriately.



    5.11 Hypersensitivity Reactions



  There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with sitagliptin, a component of STEGLUJAN. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Onset of these reactions occurred within the first 3 months after initiation of treatment with sitagliptin, with some reports occurring after the first dose. If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue STEGLUJAN, assess for other potential causes for the event, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes. [See  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  .]  



 Angioedema has also been reported with other dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema with another DPP-4 inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with STEGLUJAN.



    5.12 Increases in Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C)



  Dose-related increases in LDL-C can occur with ertugliflozin, a component of STEGLUJAN [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Monitor and treat as appropriate.



    5.13 Severe and Disabling Arthralgia



  There have been postmarketing reports of severe and disabling arthralgia in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. The time to onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy varied from one day to years. Patients experienced relief of symptoms upon discontinuation of the medication. A subset of patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms when restarting the same drug or a different DPP-4 inhibitor. Consider DPP-4 inhibitors as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate.



    5.14 Bullous Pemphigoid



  Postmarketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization have been reported with DPP-4 inhibitor use. In reported cases, patients typically recovered with topical or systemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of the DPP-4 inhibitor. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions while receiving STEGLUJAN. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, STEGLUJAN should be discontinued and referral to a dermatologist should be considered for diagnosis and appropriate treatment.



    5.15 Macrovascular Outcomes



  There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with STEGLUJAN.
