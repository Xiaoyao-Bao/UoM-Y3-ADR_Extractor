  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     Adverse Reactions in Adult Subjects with Chronic Hepatitis B and Compensated Liver Disease  



 The safety assessment of VEMLIDY was based on pooled data through the Week 96 data analysis from 1298 subjects in two randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trials, Study 108 and Study 110, in adult subjects with chronic hepatitis B and compensated liver disease. A total of 866 subjects received VEMLIDY 25 mg once daily  [see  Clinical Studies (14.1)  ]  . Further safety assessment was based on pooled data from Studies 108 and 110 from subjects who continued to receive their original blinded treatment through Week 120 and additionally from subjects who received open-label VEMLIDY from Week 96 through Week 120 (n = 361 remained on VEMLIDY; n = 180 switched from TDF to VEMLIDY at Week 96).



 Based on the Week 96 analysis, the most common adverse reaction (all Grades) reported in at least 10% of subjects in the VEMLIDY group was headache. The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment with VEMLIDY or TDF due to adverse reactions of any severity was 1.5% and 0.9%, respectively. Table 1 displays the frequency of the adverse reactions (all Grades) greater than or equal to 5% in the VEMLIDY group.

         Additional adverse reactions occurring in less than 5% of subjects in Studies 108 and 110 included vomiting, rash, and flatulence.
 

 The safety profile of VEMLIDY in subjects who continued to receive blinded treatment through Week 120 was similar to that at Week 96. The safety profile of VEMLIDY in subjects who remained on VEMLIDY in the open-label phase through Week 120 was similar to that in subjects who switched from TDF to VEMLIDY at Week 96.



     Renal Laboratory Tests  



 In a pooled analysis of Studies 108 and 110 in adult subjects with chronic hepatitis B and a median baseline eGFR of 106 and 105 mL per minute (for the VEMLIDY and TDF groups, respectively), mean serum creatinine increased by less than 0.1 mg/dL and median serum phosphorus decreased by 0.1 mg/ dL in both treatment groups at Week 96. Median change from baseline to Week 96 in eGFR was -1.2 mL per minute in the VEMLIDY group and -4.8 mL per minute in those receiving TDF. The long-term clinical significance of these renal laboratory changes on adverse reaction frequencies between VEMLIDY and TDF is not known.



 In subjects who remained on blinded treatment beyond Week 96 in Studies 108 and 110, change from baseline in renal laboratory parameter values in each group at Week 120 were similar to those at Week 96. In the open-label phase, median change in eGFR from Week 96 to Week 120 was -0.6 mL per minute in subjects who remained on VEMLIDY and 1.8 mL per minute in those who switched from TDF to VEMLIDY at Week 96. Mean serum creatinine and median serum phosphorus values at Week 120 were similar to those at Week 96 in subjects who remained on VEMLIDY and in subjects who switched from TDF to VEMLIDY.



     Bone Mineral Density Effects  



 In a pooled analysis of Studies 108 and 110, the mean percentage change in bone mineral density (BMD) from baseline to Week 96 as assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was -0.7% with VEMLIDY compared to -2.6% with TDF at the lumbar spine and -0.3% compared to -2.5% at the total hip. BMD declines of 5% or greater at the lumbar spine were experienced by 11% of VEMLIDY subjects and 25% of TDF subjects at Week 96. BMD declines of 7% or greater at the femoral neck were experienced by 5% of VEMLIDY subjects and 13% of TDF subjects at Week 96.



 In subjects who remained on blinded treatment beyond Week 96 in Studies 108 and 110, mean percentage change in BMD in each group at Week 120 was similar to that at Week 96. In the open-label phase, mean percentage change in BMD from Week 96 to Week 120 in subjects who remained on VEMLIDY was 0.6% at the lumbar spine and 0% at the total hip, compared to 1.7% at the lumber spine and 0.6% at the total hip in those who switched from TDF to VEMLIDY.



 The long-term clinical significance of these BMD changes is not known.



     Laboratory Abnormalities  



 The frequency of laboratory abnormalities (Grades 3-4) occurring in at least 2% of subjects receiving VEMLIDY in Studies 108 and 110 are presented in Table 2.

         The overall incidence of blinded treatment ALT flares (defined as confirmed serum ALT greater than 2 * baseline and greater than 10 * ULN at 2 consecutive postbaseline visits, with or without associated symptoms) was similar between VEMLIDY (0.6%) and TDF (0.9%) through Week 96. ALT flares generally were not associated with coincident elevations in bilirubin, occurred within the first 12 weeks of treatment, and resolved without recurrence.
 

 Based on the Week 120 analysis, the frequencies of lab abnormalities in subjects who remained on VEMLIDY in the open-label phase were similar to those in subjects who switched from TDF to VEMLIDY at Week 96.



     Amylase and Lipase Elevations and Pancreatitis  



 At Week 96, in Studies 108 and 110, eight subjects treated with VEMLIDY with elevated amylase levels had associated symptoms, such as nausea, low back pain; abdominal tenderness, pain, and distension; and biliary pancreatitis and pancreatitis. Of these eight, two subjects discontinued VEMLIDY due to elevated amylase and/or lipase; one subject experienced recurrence of adverse events when VEMLIDY was restarted. No subject treated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate had associated symptoms or discontinued treatment.



 From Week 96 to Week 120, one additional subject who continued open-label VEMLIDY and none of the subjects who switched from TDF to VEMLIDY had elevated amylase levels and associated symptoms.



     Serum Lipids  



 Changes from baseline in total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and total cholesterol to HDL ratio among subjects treated with VEMLIDY and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate are presented in Table 3.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING:  POST TREATMENT SEVERE ACUTE EXACERBATION OF HEPATITIS B

  WARNING:  POST TREATMENT SEVERE ACUTE EXACERBATION OF HEPATITIS B

    Discontinuation of anti-hepatitis B therapy, including VEMLIDY, may result in severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B. Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who discontinue anti-hepatitis B therapy, including VEMLIDY. If appropriate, resumption of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  .  



   EXCERPT:   WARNING: POST TREATMENT SEVERE ACUTE EXACERBATION OF HEPATITIS B



   See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.  



 *  Discontinuation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may result in severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B. Hepatic function should be monitored closely in patients who discontinue VEMLIDY. If appropriate, resumption of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted. (5.1) 
    
</Section>
    <Section id="S3" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  HBV and HIV-1 coinfection: VEMLIDY alone is not recommended for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. HIV-1 resistance may develop in these patients. (  5.2  ) 
 *  New onset or worsening renal impairment: Prior to or when initiating VEMLIDY, and during treatment on a clinically appropriate schedule, assess serum creatinine, estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein in all patients. Also assess serum phosphorus in patients with chronic kidney disease. (  5.3  ) 
 *  Lactic acidosis/severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: Discontinue treatment in patients who develop symptoms or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity. (  5.4  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Severe Acute Exacerbation of Hepatitis B after Discontinuation of Treatment



  Discontinuation of anti-hepatitis B therapy, including VEMLIDY, may result in severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B. Patients who discontinue VEMLIDY should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. If appropriate, resumption of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted.



    5.2 Risk of Development of HIV-1 Resistance in Patients Coinfected with HBV and HIV-1



  Due to the risk of development of HIV-1 resistance, VEMLIDY alone is not recommended for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. The safety and efficacy of VEMLIDY have not been established in patients coinfected with HBV and HIV-1. HIV antibody testing should be offered to all HBV-infected patients before initiating therapy with VEMLIDY, and, if positive, an appropriate antiretroviral combination regimen that is recommended for patients coinfected with HIV-1 should be used.



    5.3 New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment



  Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia), has been reported with the use of tenofovir prodrugs in both animal toxicology studies and human trials. In clinical trials of VEMLIDY, there have been no cases of Fanconi syndrome or Proximal Renal Tubulopathy (PRT).



 Patients taking tenofovir prodrugs who have impaired renal function and those taking nephrotoxic agents, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, are at increased risk of developing renal-related adverse reactions [see  Drug Interactions (7.2)  ]  .



  Prior to or when initiating VEMLIDY, and during treatment with VEMLIDY on a clinically appropriate schedule, assess serum creatinine, estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein in all patients. In patients with chronic kidney disease, also assess serum phosphorus. Discontinue VEMLIDY in patients who develop clinically significant decreases in renal function or evidence of Fanconi syndrome.  



    5.4 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis



  Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs, including tenofovir DF, another prodrug of tenofovir, alone or in combination with other antiretrovirals. Treatment with VEMLIDY should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations).
