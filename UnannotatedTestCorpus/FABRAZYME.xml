  6.1 Adverse Reactions in Clinical Studies

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trial of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in patients in clinical practice.



 The most serious adverse reactions reported with Fabrazyme treatment during clinical trials were anaphylactic and allergic reactions        [see      Warnings and Precautions (5.1)          ]    . 



 The most common adverse reactions reported with Fabrazyme are infusion reactions, some of which were severe    [see           Warnings and Precautions (5.1)          and          (5.2)      ]        .  Serious and/or frequently occurring (&gt;= 5% incidence) related adverse reactions consisted of one or more of the following: chills, pyrexia, feeling hot or cold, dyspnea, nausea, flushing, headache, vomiting, paresthesia, fatigue, pruritus, pain in extremity, hypertension, chest pain, throat tightness, abdominal pain, dizziness, tachycardia, nasal congestion, diarrhea, edema peripheral, myalgia, back pain, pallor, bradycardia, urticaria, hypotension, face edema, rash, and somnolence. The occurrence of somnolence can be attributed to clinical trial specified pretreatment with antihistamines.  Most infusion-related reactions requiring intervention were ameliorated with slowing of the infusion rate, temporarily stopping the infusion, and/or administration of antipyretics, antihistamines, or steroids.   



 Other reported serious adverse events included stroke, pain, ataxia, bradycardia, cardiac arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, decreased cardiac output, vertigo, hypoacousia, and nephrotic syndrome.  These adverse events also occur as manifestations of Fabry disease; an alteration in frequency or severity cannot be determined from the small numbers of patients studied.



 The data described below reflect exposure of 80 patients, ages 16 to 61 years, to 1 mg/kg Fabrazyme every two weeks in two separate double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials, for periods ranging from 1 to 35 months (mean 15.5 months).  All 58 patients enrolled in one of the two studies continued into an open-label extension study of Fabrazyme treatment for up to 54 additional months.  Patients were treated with antipyretics and antihistamines prior to the infusions.



       Table 2       enumerates treatment-emergent adverse reactions (regardless of relationship) that occurred during the double-blind treatment periods of the two placebo-controlled trials (Study 1 and Study 2)        [see      Clinical Studies (14)          ]    .  Reported adverse reactions have been classified by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology System Organ Class and Preferred Term.

 The safety profile of Fabrazyme in pediatric Fabry disease patients, ages 8 to 16 years, was found to be consistent with that seen in adults    [see           Use in Specific Populations (8.4)              and      Clinical Studies (14)          ]    .  The safety of Fabrazyme in patients younger than 8 years of age has not been evaluated.



   6.2 Immunogenicity

  Ninety-five of 121 (79%) adult patients and 11 of 16 (69%) pediatric patients (106 of 137, 74% of all patients) treated with Fabrazyme in clinical studies have developed IgG antibodies to Fabrazyme.  Most patients who develop IgG antibodies do so within the first three months of exposure.  IgG seroconversion in pediatric patients was associated with prolonged half-life of Fabrazyme, a phenomenon rarely observed in adult patients        [see      Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)      and              Use in Specific Populations (8.4)      ].         A possible cause for this prolongation likely pertains to the ability of antibodies to act as "carriers" for their antigens.  Among the 14 female patients exposed to Fabrazyme in clinical studies, six (adult patients) developed IgG antibodies to Fabrazyme. 



 IgG antibodies to Fabrazyme were purified from 15 patients with high antibody titers (&gt;= 12,800) and studied for inhibition of    in vitro    enzyme activity.  Under the conditions of this assay, most of these 15 patients had inhibition of    in vitro    enzyme activity ranging between 21-74% at one or more time points during the study.  Assessment of inhibition of enzyme uptake in cells has not been performed.  No general pattern was seen in individual patient reactivity over time.  The clinical significance of binding and/or inhibitory antibodies to Fabrazyme is not known.  In patients followed in the open-label extension study, reduction of GL-3 in plasma and GL-3 inclusions in superficial skin capillaries was maintained after antibody formation. 



 As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity.  The data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were considered positive for antibodies to Fabrazyme using an ELISA and radioimmunoprecipitation (RIP) assay for antibodies. The incidence of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease.  For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to Fabrazyme with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.



 Testing for IgE antibodies was performed in approximately 60 patients in clinical trials who experienced moderate to severe infusion reactions or in whom mast cell activation was suspected.  Seven of these patients tested positive for Fabrazyme-specific IgE antibodies or had a positive skin test to Fabrazyme.  Patients who have had a positive skin test to Fabrazyme, or who have tested positive for Fabrazyme-specific IgE antibodies in clinical trials with Fabrazyme have been re-challenged        [see      Clinical Studies (14)      ,      Warnings and Precautions (5.4)      and              Dosage and Administration (2)      ].        



   6.3 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of FABRAZYME. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 In postmarketing experience with agalsidase beta, severe and serious infusion-related reactions have been reported, some of which were life-threatening, including anaphylactic shock        [see      Warnings and Precautions (5.1)      ].          Reactions have included localized angioedema (including auricular swelling, eye swelling, dysphagia, lip swelling, edema, pharyngeal edema, face swelling, and swollen tongue), generalized urticaria, bronchospasm, and hypotension.



 Adverse reactions (regardless of relationship) resulting in death reported in the postmarketing setting with FABRAZYME treatment included cardiorespiratory arrest, respiratory failure, cardiac failure, sepsis, cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction, renal failure, and pneumonia. Some of these reactions were reported in Fabry disease patients with significant underlying disease.



 In addition to the adverse reactions reported in      Adverse Reactions in Clinical Studies (6.1)      , the following adverse reactions have been reported during postmarketing use of agalsidase beta: arthralgia, asthenia, erythema, hyperhidrosis, infusion site reaction, lacrimation increased, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, lymphadenopathy, hypoesthesia, oral hypoesthesia, palpitations, rhinorrhea, oxygen saturation decreased, and hypoxia.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Life-threatening anaphylactic and severe allergic reactions have been observed in some patients during Fabrazyme infusions.  If severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions occur, immediately discontinue administration of Fabrazyme and provide necessary emergency treatment.  Appropriate medical support measures should be readily available when Fabrazyme is administered because of the potential for severe infusion reactions (  5.1  ). 
 *  Infusion reactions occurred in approximately 50 to 55% of patients during Fabrazyme administration in clinical trials.  Some reactions were severe.  In patients experiencing infusion reactions, pretreatment with an antipyretic and antihistamine is recommended.  If an infusion reaction occurs, decreasing the infusion rate, temporarily stopping the infusion, and/or administrating additional antipyretics, antihistamines, and/or steroids may ameliorate the symptoms (  5.2  ). 
 *  If severe infusion reactions occur, immediate discontinuation of the administration of Fabrazyme should be considered, and appropriate medical treatment should be initiated.  Severe reactions are generally managed with administration of antihistamines, corticosteroids, IV fluids and/or oxygen as clinically indicated (  5.2  ). 
 *  Patients with advanced Fabry disease may have compromised cardiac function, which may predispose them to a higher risk of severe complications from infusion reactions, and these patients should be monitored closely during Fabrazyme administration (  5.3  ). 
 *  Re-administration of Fabrazyme to patients who have previously experienced severe or serious allergic reactions to Fabrazyme should be done only after careful consideration of the risks and benefits of continued treatment, and only under the direct supervision of qualified personnel and with appropriate medical support measures readily available (  5.4  ). 
    
 

   5.1 Anaphylaxis and Allergic Reactions



  Life-threatening anaphylactic and severe allergic reactions have been observed in patients during Fabrazyme infusions. Reactions have included localized angioedema (including swelling of the face, mouth, and throat), bronchospasm, hypotension, generalized urticaria, dysphagia, rash, dyspnea, flushing, chest discomfort, pruritus, and nasal congestion. Interventions have included cardiopulmonary resuscitation, oxygen supplementation, IV fluids, hospitalization, and treatment with inhaled beta-adrenergic agonists, epinephrine, and IV corticosteroids.



 In clinical trials and postmarketing safety experience with Fabrazyme, approximately 1% of patients developed anaphylactic or severe allergic reactions during Fabrazyme infusion. 



 If anaphylactic or severe allergic reactions occur, immediately discontinue the administration of Fabrazyme and initiate necessary emergency treatment. Because of the potential for severe allergic reactions, appropriate medical support measures should be readily available when Fabrazyme is administered.



 The risks and benefits of re-administering Fabrazyme following an anaphylactic or severe allergic reaction should be considered. Extreme care should be exercised, with appropriate medical support measures readily available, if the decision is made to re-administer the product  [see        Warnings and Precautions (5.4)        and        Clinical Studies (14)        ]    .



    5.2 Infusion Reactions



  In clinical trials with Fabrazyme, approximately 50-55% of patients experienced infusion reactions during Fabrazyme administration, some of which were severe  [see        Warnings and Precautions (5.1)    ].         Severe infusion reactions experienced by more than one patient in clinical studies with Fabrazyme included chills, vomiting, hypotension, and paresthesia.  Other infusion reactions included pyrexia, feeling hot or cold, dyspnea, nausea, flushing, headache, fatigue, pruritus, pain in extremity, hypertension, chest pain, throat tightness, abdominal pain, dizziness, tachycardia, nasal congestion, diarrhea, edema peripheral, myalgia, urticaria, bradycardia, and somnolence. 



 Most patients in clinical trials were pretreated with acetaminophen.  In patients experiencing infusion reactions, pretreatment with an antipyretic and antihistamine is recommended.  Infusion reactions occurred in some patients after receiving pretreatment with antipyretics, antihistamines, and oral steroids.  Infusion reactions tended to decline in frequency with continued use of Fabrazyme.  However, infusion reactions may still occur despite extended duration of Fabrazyme treatment.  If an infusion reaction occurs, decreasing the infusion rate, temporarily stopping the infusion, and/or administrating additional antipyretics, antihistamines, and/or steroids may ameliorate the symptoms.  If severe infusion reactions occur, immediate discontinuation of the administration of Fabrazyme should be considered, and appropriate medical treatment should be initiated.  Severe reactions are generally managed with administration of antihistamines, corticosteroids, intravenous fluids, and/or oxygen, when clinically indicated.  Because of the potential for severe infusion reactions, appropriate medical support measures should be readily available when Fabrazyme is administered.  Patients who have experienced infusion reactions should be treated with caution when re-administering Fabrazyme. 



    5.3 Compromised Cardiac Function



  Patients with advanced Fabry disease may have compromised cardiac function, which may predispose them to a higher risk of severe complications from infusion reactions    [see      Warnings and Precautions (5.1)    and            (5.2)    ].        Patients with compromised cardiac function should be monitored closely if the decision is made to administer Fabrazyme.



    5.4 Immunogenicity and Re-challenge



  In clinical trials with Fabrazyme, a few patients developed IgE antibodies or skin test reactivity specific to Fabrazyme.  Two of six patients in the re-challenge study discontinued treatment with Fabrazyme prematurely due to recurrent infusion reactions. Four serious infusion reactions occurred in three patients during Fabrazyme infusions, including bronchospasm, urticaria, hypotension, and development of Fabrazyme-specific antibodies.  Other infusion-related reactions occurring in more than one patient during the study included rigors, hypertension, nausea, vomiting, and pruritus.  Physicians should consider testing for IgE antibodies in patients who experienced suspected allergic reactions and consider the risks and benefits of continued treatment in patients with anti-Fabrazyme IgE antibodies    [see      Warnings and Precautions (5.1)    and            Dosage and Administration (2)    ].        



 Patients who have had a positive skin test to Fabrazyme or who have tested positive for Fabrazyme-specific    IgE antibody have been re-challenged with Fabrazyme using a re-challenge protocol    [see      Clinical Studies (14)    ].         Re-challenge of these patients should only occur under the direct supervision of qualified personnel, with appropriate medical support measures readily available.



    5.5 Monitoring: Laboratory Tests



  There are no marketed tests for antibodies against Fabrazyme.  If testing is warranted, contact your local Genzyme representative or Genzyme Corporation at (800) 745-4447.
