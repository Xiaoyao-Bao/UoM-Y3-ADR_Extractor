  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 Newly Diagnosed MM - REVLIMID Combination Therapy:



 Data were evaluated from 1613 patients in a large phase 3 study who received at least one dose of REVLIMID with low dose dexamethasone (Rd) given for 2 different durations of time (i.e., until progressive disease [Arm Rd Continuous; N=532] or for up to eighteen 28-day cycles [72 weeks, Arm Rd18; N=540] or who received melphalan, prednisone and thalidomide (Arm MPT; N=541) for a maximum of twelve 42-day cycles (72 weeks). The median treatment duration in the Rd Continuous arm was 80.2 weeks (range 0.7 to 246.7) or 18.4 months (range 0.16 to 56.7).



 In general, the most frequently reported adverse reactions were comparable in Arm Rd Continuous and Arm Rd18, and included diarrhea, anemia, constipation, peripheral edema, neutropenia, fatigue, back pain, nausea, asthenia, and insomnia. The most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 reactions included neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, pneumonia, asthenia, fatigue, back pain, hypokalemia, rash, cataract, lymphopenia, dyspnea, DVT, hyperglycemia, and leukopenia. The highest frequency of infections occurred in Arm Rd Continuous (75%) compared to Arm MPT (56%). There were more grade 3 and 4 and serious adverse reactions of infection in Arm Rd Continuous than either Arm MPT or Rd18.



 In the Rd Continuous arm, the most common adverse reactions leading to dose interruption of REVLIMID were infection events (28.8%); overall, the median time to the first dose interruption of REVLIMID was 7 weeks. The most common adverse reactions leading to dose reduction of REVLIMID in the Rd Continuous arm were hematologic events (10.7%); overall, the median time to the first dose reduction of REVLIMID was 16 weeks. In the Rd Continuous arm, the most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of REVLIMID were infection events (3.4%).



 In both Rd arms, the frequencies of onset of adverse reactions were generally highest in the first 6 months of treatment and then the frequencies decreased over time or remained stable throughout treatment, except for cataracts. The frequency of onset of cataracts increased over time with 0.7% during the first 6 months and up to 9.6% by the 2nd year of treatment with Rd Continuous.



   Table 4  summarizes the adverse reactions reported for the Rd Continuous, Rd18, and MPT treatment arms.

             Newly Diagnosed MM - REVLIMID Maintenance Therapy Following Auto-HSCT:
 

 Data were evaluated from 1018 patients in two randomized trials who received at least one dose of REVLIMID 10 mg daily as maintenance therapy after auto-HSCT until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity, The mean treatment duration for REVLIMID treatment was 30.3 months for Maintenance Study 1 and 24.0 months for Maintenance Study 2 (overall range across both studies from 0.1 to 108 months). As of the cut-off date of 1 Mar 2015, 48 patients (21%) in the Maintenance Study 1 REVLIMID arm were still on treatment and none of the patients in the Maintenance Study 2 REVLIMID arm were still on treatment at the same cut-off date



 The adverse reactions listed from Maintenance Study 1 included events reported post-transplant (completion of high-dose melphalan /auto-HSCT), and the maintenance treatment period. In Maintenance Study 2, the adverse reactions were from the maintenance treatment period only. In general, the most frequently reported adverse reactions (more than 20% in the REVLIMID arm) across both studies were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, anemia, upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, nasopharyngitis, cough, gastroenteritis, diarrhea, rash, fatigue, asthenia, muscle spasm and pyrexia. The most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 reactions (more than 20% in the REVLIMID arm) included neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia. The serious adverse reactions lung infection and neutropenia (more than 4.5%) occurred in the REVLIMID arm.



 For REVLIMID, the most common adverse reactions leading to dose interruption were hematologic events (29.7%, data available in Maintenance Study 2 only). The most common adverse reaction leading to dose reduction of REVLIMID were hematologic events (17.7%, data available in Maintenance Study 2 only). The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of REVLIMID were thrombocytopenia (2.7%) in Maintenance Study 1 and neutropenia (2.4%) in Maintenance Study 2.



 The frequencies of onset of adverse reactions were generally highest in the first 6 months of treatment and then the frequencies decreased over time or remained stable throughout treatment.



   Table 5  summarizes the adverse reactions reported for the REVLIMID and placebo maintenance treatment arms.

 Data were evaluated from 703 patients in two studies who received at least one dose of REVLIMID/dexamethasone (353 patients) or placebo/dexamethasone (350 patients).



 In the REVLIMID/dexamethasone treatment group, 269 patients (76%) had at least one dose interruption with or without a dose reduction of REVLIMID compared to 199 patients (57%) in the placebo/dexamethasone treatment group. Of these patients who had one dose interruption with or without a dose reduction, 50% in the REVLIMID/dexamethasone treatment group had at least one additional dose interruption with or without a dose reduction compared to 21% in the placebo/dexamethasone treatment group. Most adverse reactions and Grade 3/4 adverse reactions were more frequent in patients who received the combination of REVLIMID/dexamethasone compared to placebo/dexamethasone.



 Tables  6  ,  7  , and  8  summarize the adverse reactions reported for REVLIMID/dexamethasone and placebo/dexamethasone groups.

 VTE and ATE are increased in patients treated with REVLIMID.



 Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was reported as a serious (7.4%) or severe (8.2%) adverse drug reaction at a higher rate in the REVLIMID/dexamethasone group compared to 3.1 % and 3.4% in the placebo/dexamethasone group, respectively in the 2 studies in patients with at least 1 prior therapy with discontinuations due to DVT adverse reactions reported at comparable rates between groups. In the NDMM study, DVT was reported as an adverse reaction (all grades: 10.3%, 7.2%, 4.1%), as a serious adverse reaction (3.6%, 2.0%, 1.7%), and as a Grade 3/4 adverse reaction (5.6%, 3.7%, 2.8%) in the Rd Continuous, Rd18, and MPT Arms, respectively. Discontinuations and dose reductions due to DVT adverse reactions were reported at comparable rates between the Rd Continuous and Rd18 Arms (both &lt;1%). Interruption of REVLIMID treatment due to DVT adverse reactions was reported at comparable rates between the Rd Continuous (2.3%) and Rd18 (1.5%) arms. Pulmonary embolism (PE) was reported as a serious adverse drug reaction (3.7%) or Grade 3/4 (4.0%) at a higher rate in the REVLIMID/dexamethasone group compared to 0.9% (serious or grade 3/4) in the placebo/dexamethasone group in the 2 studies in patients with, at least 1 prior therapy, with discontinuations due to PE adverse reactions reported at comparable rates between groups. In the NDMM study, the frequency of adverse reactions of PE was similar between the Rd Continuous, Rd18, and MPT Arms for adverse reactions (all grades: 3.9%, 3.3%, and 4.3%, respectively), serious adverse reactions (3.8%, 2.8%, and 3.7%, respectively), and grade 3/4 adverse reactions (3.8%, 3.0%, and 3.7%, respectively).



 Myocardial infarction was reported as a serious (1.7%) or severe (1.7%) adverse drug reaction at a higher rate in the REVLIMID/dexamethasone group compared to 0.6 % and 0.6% respectively in the placebo/dexamethasone group. Discontinuation due to MI (including acute) adverse reactions was 0.8% in REVLIMID/dexamethasone group and none in the placebo/dexamethasone group. In the NDMM study, myocardial infarction (including acute) was reported as an adverse reaction (all grades: 2.4%, 0.6%, and 1.1%), as a serious adverse reaction, (2.3%, 0.6%, and 1.1%), or as a severe adverse reaction (1.9%, 0.6%, and 0.9%) in the Rd Continuous, Rd18, and MPT Arms, respectively.



 Stroke (CVA) was reported as a serious (2.3%) or severe (2.0%) adverse drug reaction in the REVLIMID/dexamethasone group compared to 0.9% and 0.9% respectively in the placebo/dexamethasone group. Discontinuation due to stroke (CVA) was 1.4% in REVLIMID/ dexamethasone group and 0.3% in the placebo/dexamethasone group. In the NDMM study, CVA was reported as an adverse reaction (all grades: 0.8%, 0.6%, and 0.6%), as a serious adverse reaction (0.8%, 0.6 %, and 0.6%), or as a severe adverse reaction (0.6%, 0.6%, 0.2%) in the Rd Continuous, Rd18, and MPT arms respectively.



 Other Adverse Reactions: After At Least One Prior Therapy for MM



 In these 2 studies, the following adverse drug reactions (ADRs) not described above that occurred at &gt;=1% rate and of at least twice of the placebo percentage rate were reported:



   Blood and lymphatic system disorders:  pancytopenia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia



   Cardiac disorders:  bradycardia, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris



   Endocrine disorders:  hirsutism



   Eye disorders:  blindness, ocular hypertension



   Gastrointestinal disorders:  gastrointestinal hemorrhage, glossodynia



   General disorders and administration site conditions:  malaise



   Investigations:  liver function tests abnormal, alanine aminotransferase increased



   Nervous system disorders:  cerebral ischemia



   Psychiatric disorders:  mood swings, hallucination, loss of libido



   Reproductive system and breast disorders:  erectile dysfunction



   Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders:  cough, hoarseness



   Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:  exanthem, skin hyperpigmentation



 Myelodysplastic Syndromes:



 A total of 148 patients received at least 1 dose of 10 mg REVLIMID in the del 5q MDS clinical study. At least one adverse event was reported in all of the 148 patients who were treated with the 10 mg starting dose of REVLIMID. The most frequently reported adverse events were related to blood and lymphatic system disorders, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, and general disorders and administrative site conditions.



 Thrombocytopenia (61.5%; 91/148) and neutropenia (58.8%; 87/148) were the most frequently reported adverse events. The next most common adverse events observed were diarrhea (48.6%; 72/148), pruritus (41.9%; 62/148), rash (35.8%; 53/148) and fatigue (31.1%; 46/148).  Table 9  summarizes the adverse events that were reported in &gt;= 5% of the REVLIMID treated patients in the del 5q MDS clinical study.  Table 10  summarizes the most frequently observed Grade 3 and Grade 4 adverse reactions regardless of relationship to treatment with REVLIMID. In the single-arm studies conducted, it is often not possible to distinguish adverse events that are drug-related and those that reflect the patient's underlying disease.

 Mantle Cell Lymphoma:



 In the MCL trial, a total of 134 patients received at least 1 dose of REVLIMID. Their median age was 67 (range 43-83) years, 128/134 (96%) were Caucasian, 108/134 (81%) were males and 82/134 (61%) had duration of MCL for at least 3 years.



   Table 11  summarizes the most frequently observed adverse reactions regardless of relationship to treatment with REVLIMID. Across the 134 patients treated in this study, median duration of treatment was 95 days (1-1002 days). Seventy-eight patients (58%) received 3 or more cycles of therapy, 53 patients (40%) received 6 or more cycles, and 26 patients (19%) received 12 or more cycles. Seventy-six patients (57%) underwent at least one dose interruption due to adverse events, and 51 patients (38%) underwent at least one dose reduction due to adverse events. Twenty-six patients (19%) discontinued treatment due to adverse events.

Thalidomide is a known human teratogen that causes severe life-threatening human birth defects. If lenalidomide is used during pregnancy, it may cause birth defects or embryo-fetal death.  In females of reproductive potential, obtain 2 negative pregnancy tests before starting REVLIMID  (r)   treatment.  Females of reproductive potential must use 2 forms of contraception or continuously abstain from heterosexual sex during and for 4 weeks after REVLIMID treatment   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  ), and Medication Guide (  17  )]  .  To avoid embryo-fetal exposure to lenalidomide, REVLIMID is only available through a restricted distribution program, the REVLIMID REMS  (r)   program (  5.2  ).



 Information about the REVLIMID REMS program is available at www.celgeneriskmanagement.com or by calling the manufacturer's toll-free number 1-888-423-5436.



   Hematologic Toxicity (Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia)  



 REVLIMID can cause significant neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Eighty percent of patients with del 5q myelodysplastic syndromes had to have a dose delay/reduction during the major study. Thirty-four percent of patients had to have a second dose delay/reduction. Grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity was seen in 80% of patients enrolled in the study.  Patients on therapy for del 5q myelodysplastic syndromes should have their complete blood counts monitored weekly for the first 8 weeks of therapy and at least monthly thereafter. Patients may require dose interruption and/or reduction. Patients may require use of blood product support and/or growth factors   [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  )]  .



   Venous and Arterial Thromboembolism  



 REVLIMID has demonstrated a significantly increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), as well as risk of myocardial infarction and stroke in patients with multiple myeloma who were treated with REVLIMID and dexamethasone therapy. Monitor for and advise patients about signs and symptoms of thromboembolism. Advise patients to seek immediate medical care if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or arm or leg swelling. Thromboprophylaxis is recommended and the choice of regimen should be based on an assessment of the patient's underlying risks   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.4  )]  .

   5.1 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  REVLIMID is a thalidomide analogue and is contraindicated for use during pregnancy. Thalidomide is a known human teratogen that causes life-threatening human birth defects or embryo-fetal death [ see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  )]  . An embryo-fetal development study in monkeys indicates that lenalidomide produced malformations in the offspring of female monkeys who received the drug during pregnancy, similar to birth defects observed in humans following exposure to thalidomide during pregnancy.



 REVLIMID is only available through the REVLIMID REMS program [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )]  .



   Females of Reproductive Potential    Females of reproductive potential must avoid pregnancy for at least 4 weeks before beginning REVLIMID therapy, during therapy, during dose interruptions and for at least 4 weeks after completing therapy.
 

 Females must commit either to abstain continuously from heterosexual sexual intercourse or to use two methods of reliable birth control, beginning 4 weeks prior to initiating treatment with REVLIMID, during therapy, during dose interruptions and continuing for 4 weeks following discontinuation of REVLIMID therapy.



 Two negative pregnancy tests must be obtained prior to initiating therapy. The first test should be performed within 10-14 days and the second test within 24 hours prior to prescribing REVLIMID therapy and then weekly during the first month, then monthly thereafter in females with regular menstrual cycles or every 2 weeks in females with irregular menstrual cycles [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.3  )]  .



   Males    Lenalidomide is present in the semen of patients receiving the drug. Therefore, males must always use a latex or synthetic condom during any sexual contact with females of reproductive potential while taking REVLIMID and for up to 4 weeks after discontinuing REVLIMID, even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy. Male patients taking REVLIMID must not donate sperm [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.3  )]  .
 

   Blood Donation    Patients must not donate blood during treatment with REVLIMID and for 4 weeks following discontinuation of the drug because the blood might be given to a pregnant female patient whose fetus must not be exposed to REVLIMID.
 

    5.2 REVLIMID REMS Program



  Because of the embryo-fetal risk [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )]  , REVLIMID is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), the REVLIMID REMS  program.



 Required components of the REVLIMID REMS  program include the following:



 *  Prescribers must be certified with the REVLIMID REMS program by enrolling and complying with the REMS requirements. 
 *  Patients must sign a Patient-Physician agreement form and comply with the REMS requirements. In particular, female patients of reproductive potential who are not pregnant must comply with the pregnancy testing and contraception requirements [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.3  )] and males must comply with contraception requirements [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.3  )].  
 *  Pharmacies must be certified with the REVLIMID REMS program, must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive REVLIMID and comply with REMS requirements. 
    Further information about the REVLIMID REMS  program is available at www.celgeneriskmanagement.com or by telephone at 1-888-423-5436.
 

    5.3 Hematologic Toxicity



   REVLIMID can cause significant neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Monitor patients with neutropenia for signs of infection. Advise patients to observe for bleeding or bruising, especially with use of concomitant medication that may increase risk of bleeding. Patients taking REVLIMID should have their complete blood counts assessed periodically as described below [see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  ,  2.2  ,  2.3  )]  .  



  Patients taking REVLIMID in combination with dexamethasone or as REVLIMID maintenance therapy for MM should have their complete blood counts (CBC) assessed every 7 days (weekly) for the first 2 cycles, on Days 1 and 15 of Cycle 3, and every 28 days (4 weeks) thereafter. A dose interruption and/or dose reduction may be required [see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  )]  .  In the MM maintenance therapy trials, Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was reported in up to 59% of REVLIMID-treated patients and Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia in up to 38% of REVLIMID-treated patients [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  .



  Patients taking REVLIMID for MDS should have their complete blood counts monitored weekly for the first 8 weeks and at least monthly thereafter. Grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity was seen in 80% of patients enrolled in the MDS study. In the 48% of patients who developed Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, the median time to onset was 42 days (range, 14-411 days), and the median time to documented recovery was 17 days (range, 2-170 days). In the 54% of patients who developed Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia, the median time to onset was 28 days (range, 8-290 days), and the median time to documented recovery was 22 days (range, 5-224 days) [see  Boxed Warning  and Dosage and Administration (  2.2  )]  .  



  Patients taking REVLIMID for MCL should have their complete blood counts monitored weekly for the first cycle (28 days), every 2 weeks during cycles 2-4, and then monthly thereafter. Patients may require dose interruption and/or dose reduction. In the MCL trial, Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was reported in 43% of the patients. Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was reported in 28% of the patients.  



    5.4 Venous and Arterial Thromboembolism



   Venous thromboembolic events (VTE [DVT and PE]) and arterial thromboembolic events (ATE, myocardial infarction and stroke) are increased in patients treated with REVLIMID.  



  A significantly increased risk of DVT (7.4%) and of PE (3.7%) occurred in patients with MM after at least one prior therapy who were treated with REVLIMID and dexamethasone therapy compared to patients treated in the placebo and dexamethasone group (3.1% and 0.9%) in clinical trials with varying use of anticoagulant therapies. In the newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) study in which nearly all patients received antithrombotic prophylaxis, DVT was reported as a serious adverse reaction (3.6%, 2.0%, and 1.7%) in the Rd Continuous, Rd18, and MPT Arms, respectively. The frequency of serious adverse reactions of PE was similar between the Rd Continuous, Rd18, and MPT Arms (3.8%, 2.8%, and 3.7%, respectively) [see  Boxed Warning  and Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]    .



  Myocardial infarction (1.7%) and stroke (CVA) (2.3%) are increased in patients with MM after at least one prior therapy who were treated with REVLIMID and dexamethasone therapy compared to patients treated with placebo and dexamethasone (0.6%, and 0.9%) in clinical trials. In the NDMM study, myocardial infarction (including acute) was reported as a serious adverse reaction (2.3%, 0.6%, and 1.1%) in the Rd Continuous, Rd18, and MPT Arms, respectively. The frequency of serious adverse reactions of CVA was similar between the Rd Continuous, Rd18, and MPT Arms (0.8%, 0.6 %, and 0.6%, respectively) [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  .  



 Patients with known risk factors, including prior thrombosis, may be at greater risk and actions should be taken to try to minimize all modifiable factors (e.g. hyperlipidemia, hypertension, smoking).



  In controlled clinical trials that did not use concomitant thromboprophylaxis, 21.5% overall thrombotic events (Standardized MedDRA Query Embolic and Thrombotic events) occurred in patients with refractory and relapsed MM who were treated with REVLIMID and dexamethasone compared to 8.3% thrombosis in patients treated with placebo and dexamethasone. The median time to first thrombosis event was 2.8 months. In the NDMM study in which nearly all patients received antithrombotic prophylaxis, the overall frequency of thrombotic events was 17.4% in patients in the combined Rd Continuous and Rd18 Arms, and was 11.6% in the MPT Arm. The median time to first thrombosis event was 4.3 months in the combined Rd Continuous and Rd18 Arms.  



 Thromboprophylaxis is recommended. The regimen of thromboprophylaxis should be based on an assessment of the patient's underlying risks. Instruct patients to report immediately any signs and symptoms suggestive of thrombotic events. ESAs and estrogens may further increase the risk of thrombosis and their use should be based on a benefit-risk decision in patients receiving REVLIMID [see Drug Interactions (  7.2  )]  .



    5.5 Increased Mortality in Patients with CLL



  In a prospective randomized (1:1) clinical trial in the first line treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, single agent REVLIMID therapy increased the risk of death as compared to single agent chlorambucil. In an interim analysis, there were 34 deaths among 210 patients on the REVLIMID treatment arm compared to 18 deaths among 211 patients in the chlorambucil treatment arm, and hazard ratio for overall survival was 1.92 [95% CI: 1.08 - 3.41], consistent with a 92% increase in the risk of death. The trial was halted for safety in July 2013.



 Serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, including atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, and cardiac failure occurred more frequently in the REVLIMID treatment arm. REVLIMID is not indicated and not recommended for use in CLL outside of controlled clinical trials.



    5.6 Second Primary Malignancies



   In clinical trials in patients with MM receiving REVLIMID, an increase of hematologic plus solid tumor second primary malignancies (SPM) notably AML and MDS have been observed. An increase in hematologic SPM including AML and MDS occurred in 5.3% of patients with NDMM receiving REVLIMID in combination with oral melphalan compared with 1.3% of patients receiving melphalan without REVLIMID. The frequency of AML and MDS cases in patients with NDMM treated with REVLIMID in combination with dexamethasone without melphalan was 0.4%.  



  In patients receiving REVLIMID maintenance therapy following high dose intravenous melphalan and auto-HSCT, hematologic SPM occurred in 7.5% of patients compared to 3.3% in patients receiving placebo. The incidence of hematologic plus solid tumor (excluding squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma) SPM was 14.9%, compared to 8.8% in patients receiving placebo with a median follow-up of 91.5 months. Non-melanoma skin cancer SPM, including squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma, occurred in 3.9% of patients receiving REVLIMID maintenance, compared to 2.6% in the placebo arm.  



  In patients with relapsed or refractory MM treated with REVLIMID/dexamethasone, the incidence of hematologic plus solid tumor (excluding squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma) SPM was 2.3% versus 0.6% in the dexamethasone alone arm. Non-melanoma skin cancer SPM, including squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma, occurred in 3.1% of patients receiving REVLIMID/dexamethasone, compared to 0.6% in the dexamethasone alone arm.  



 Patients who received REVLIMID-containing therapy until disease progression did not show a higher incidence of invasive SPM than patients treated in the fixed duration REVLIMID-containing arms. Monitor patients for the development of second primary malignancies. Take into account both the potential benefit of REVLIMID and the risk of second primary malignancies when considering treatment with REVLIMID.



     5.7 Increased Mortality in Patients with MM When Pembrolizumab Is Added to a Thalidomide Analogue and Dexamethasone  



   In two randomized clinical trials in patients with MM, the addition of pembrolizumab to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone, a use for which no PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody is indicated, resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of patients with MM with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials.  



    5.8 Hepatotoxicity



  Hepatic failure, including fatal cases, has occurred in patients treated with lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone. In clinical trials, 15% of patients experienced hepatotoxicity (with hepatocellular, cholestatic and mixed characteristics); 2% of patients with MM and 1% of patients with myelodysplasia had serious hepatotoxicity events. The mechanism of drug-induced hepatotoxicity is unknown. Pre-existing viral liver disease, elevated baseline liver enzymes, and concomitant medications may be risk factors. Monitor liver enzymes periodically. Stop REVLIMID upon elevation of liver enzymes. After return to baseline values, treatment at a lower dose may be considered.



     5.9 Severe Cutaneous Reactions Including Hypersensitivity Reactions  



   Angioedema and severe cutaneous reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been reported. DRESS may present with a cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, fever, and/or lymphadenopathy with systemic complications such as hepatitis, nephritis, pneumonitis, myocarditis, and/or pericarditis. These events can be fatal. Patients with a prior history of Grade 4 rash associated with thalidomide treatment should not receive REVLIMID. REVLIMID interruption or discontinuation should be considered for Grade 2-3 skin rash. REVLIMID must be discontinued for angioedema, Grade 4 rash, exfoliative or bullous rash, or if SJS, TEN or DRESS is suspected and should not be resumed following discontinuation for these reactions.  



    5.10 Tumor Lysis Syndrome



  Fatal instances of tumor lysis syndrome have been reported during treatment with lenalidomide. The patients at risk of tumor lysis syndrome are those with high tumor burden prior to treatment. These patients should be monitored closely and appropriate precautions taken.



    5.11 Tumor Flare Reaction



  Tumor flare reaction has occurred during investigational use of lenalidomide for CLL and lymphoma, and is characterized by tender lymph node swelling, low grade fever, pain and rash. REVLIMID is not indicated and not recommended for use in CLL outside of controlled clinical trials.



 Monitoring and evaluation for tumor flare reaction (TFR) is recommended in patients with MCL. Tumor flare reaction may mimic progression of disease (PD). In the MCL trial, 13/134 (10%) of subjects experienced TFR; all reports were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. All of the events occurred in cycle 1 and one patient developed TFR again in cycle 11. Lenalidomide may be continued in patients with Grade 1 and 2 TFR without interruption or modification, at the physician's discretion. Patients with Grade 1 and 2 TFR may also be treated with corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or narcotic analgesics for management of TFR symptoms. In patients with Grade 3 or 4 TFR, it is recommended to withhold treatment with lenalidomide until TFR resolves to &lt;= Grade 1. Patients with Grade 3 or 4 TFR may be treated for management of symptoms per the guidance for treatment of Grade 1 and 2 TFR.



    5.12 Impaired Stem Cell Mobilization



  A decrease in the number of CD34+ cells collected after treatment (&gt; 4 cycles) with REVLIMID has been reported. In patients who are auto-HSCT candidates, referral to a transplant center should occur early in treatment to optimize the timing of the stem cell collection. In patients who received more than 4 cycles of a REVLIMID-containing treatment or for whom inadequate numbers of CD 34+ cells have been collected with G-CSF alone, G-CSF with cyclophosphamide or the combination of G-CSF with a CXCR4 inhibitor may be considered.



     5.13 Thyroid Disorders  



     Both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism have been reported [see Adverse Reactions (  6.2  )].  Measure thyroid function before start of REVLIMID treatment and during therapy.



     5.14 Early Mortality in Patients with MCL  



   In another MCL study, there was an increase in early deaths (within 20 weeks), 12.9% in the REVLIMID arm versus 7.1% in the control arm. On exploratory multivariate analysis, risk factors for early deaths include high tumor burden, MIPI score at diagnosis, and high WBC at baseline (&gt;= 10 x 10  9  /L).
