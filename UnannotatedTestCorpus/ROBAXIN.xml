   Information for Patients



  Patients should be cautioned that methocarbamol may cause drowsiness or dizziness, which may impair their ability to operate motor vehicles or machinery.



 Because methocarbamol may possess a general CNS-depressant effect, patients should be cautioned about combined effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants.



    Drug Interactions



  See    WARNINGS      and    PRECAUTIONS      for interaction with CNS drugs and alcohol.



 Methocarbamol may inhibit the effect of pyridostigmine bromide. Therefore, methocarbamol should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis receiving anticholinesterase agents.



    Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions



   Methocarbamol may cause a color interference in certain screening tests for  5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) using nitrosonaphthol reagent and in screening tests for urinary vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) using the Gitlow method.
 

    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility



  Long-term studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of methocarbamol have not been performed. No studies have been conducted to assess the effect of methocarbamol on mutagenesis or its potential to impair fertility.



    Pregnancy



    Teratogenic Effects  



    Pregnancy Category C  



  Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with methocarbamol. It is also not known whether methocarbamol can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. robaxin  (r)  and robaxin  (r)  -750 should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.



 Safe use of robaxin  (r)  and robaxin  (r)  -750 has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. There have been reports of fetal and congenital abnormalities following in utero exposure to methocarbamol. Therefore, robaxin  (r)  and robaxin  (r)  -750 should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless in the judgment of the physician the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards (see    WARNINGS      ).



    Nursing Mothers



  Methocarbamol and/or its metabolites are excreted in the milk of dogs; however, it is not known whether methocarbamol or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when robaxin  (r)  or robaxin  (r)  -750 is administered to a nursing woman.



    Pediatric Use



  Safety and effectiveness of robaxin  (r)  and robaxin  (r)  -750 in pediatric patients below the age of 16 have not been established.

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings">    WARNINGS



  Since methocarbamol may possess a general CNS depressant effect, patients receiving robaxin  (r)  or robaxin  (r)  -750 should be cautioned about combined effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants.



 Safe use of robaxin  (r)  and robaxin  (r)  -750 has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. There have been reports of fetal and congenital abnormalities following in utero exposure to methocarbamol. Therefore, robaxin  (r)  and robaxin  (r)  -750 should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless in the judgment of the physician the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards (see    PRECAUTIONS  ,  Pregnancy      ).



    Use In Activities Requiring Mental Alertness



  Methocarbamol may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. Patients should be cautioned about operating machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that methocarbamol therapy does not adversely affect their ability to engage in such activities.
