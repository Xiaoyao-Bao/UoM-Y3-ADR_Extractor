  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The safety of TRELEGY ELLIPTA is based on the safety data from two 12-week treatment trials with coadministration of umeclidinium and the fixed-dose combination of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol and a 52-week long-term trial of TRELEGY ELLIPTA compared with the fixed-dose combinations of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol and umeclidinium/vilanterol  [see Clinical Studies (  14  )]  .



   Trials 1 and 2  



 Two 12-week treatment trials (Trial 1 and Trial 2) evaluated the coadministration of umeclidinium + fluticasone furoate/vilanterol, the components of TRELEGY ELLIPTA, compared with placebo + fluticasone furoate/vilanterol. A total of 824 subjects with COPD across two 12-week, randomized, double-blind clinical trials received at least 1 dose of umeclidinium 62.5 mcg + fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 100 mcg/25 mcg or placebo + fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 100 mcg/25 mcg administered once daily (mean age: 64 years, 92% white, 66% male across all treatments)  [see Clinical Studies (  14  )]  . The incidence of adverse reactions associated with the use of umeclidinium 62.5 mcg + fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 100 mcg/25 mcg presented in  Table 1  is based on the two 12-week trials.

           Trial 3 - Long-term Safety Data  
 

 A 52-week trial (Trial 3) evaluated the long-term safety of TRELEGY ELLIPTA compared with the fixed-dose combinations of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 100 mcg/25 mcg and umeclidinium/vilanterol 62.5 mcg/25 mcg. A total of 10,355 subjects with COPD with a history of moderate or severe exacerbations within the prior 12 months were randomized (2:2:1) to receive TRELEGY ELLIPTA, fluticasone furoate/vilanterol, or umeclidinium/vilanterol administered once daily in a double-blind clinical trial (mean age: 65 years, 77% white, 66% male across all treatments)  [see Clinical Studies (  14  )]  .



 The incidence of adverse reactions in the long-term trial were consistent with those in Trials 1 and 2. However, in addition to the adverse reactions shown in  Table 1  , adverse reactions occurring in &gt;=1% of the subjects treated with TRELEGY ELLIPTA (n = 4,151) for up to 52 weeks also included upper respiratory tract infection, pneumonia  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.5  )]  , bronchitis, oral candidiasis  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.4  )]  , arthralgia, influenza, sinusitis, pharyngitis, rhinitis, constipation, urinary tract infection, and dysphonia.

   5.1 Serious Asthma-Related Events - Hospitalizations, Intubations, Death



   The safety and efficacy of TRELEGY ELLIPTA in patients with asthma have not been established. TRELEGY ELLIPTA is not indicated for the treatment of asthma.  



  Use of long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists (LABA) as monotherapy [without inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)] for asthma is associated with an increased risk of asthma-related death. Available data from controlled clinical trials also suggest that use of LABA as monotherapy increases the risk of asthma-related hospitalization in pediatric and adolescent patients. These findings are considered a class effect of LABA monotherapy. When LABA are used in fixed  - dose combination with ICS, data from large clinical trials do not show a significant increase in the risk of serious asthma-related events (hospitalizations, intubations, death) compared with ICS alone.  



  Available data from clinical trials in subjects with COPD do not suggest an increased risk of death with use of LABA in patients with COPD.  



    5.2 Deterioration of Disease and Acute Episodes



  TRELEGY ELLIPTA should not be initiated in patients during rapidly deteriorating or potentially life-threatening episodes of COPD. TRELEGY ELLIPTA has not been studied in subjects with acutely deteriorating COPD. The initiation of TRELEGY ELLIPTA in this setting is not appropriate.



 TRELEGY ELLIPTA should not be used for the relief of acute symptoms, i.e., as rescue therapy for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm. TRELEGY ELLIPTA has not been studied in the relief of acute symptoms and extra doses should not be used for that purpose. Acute symptoms should be treated with an inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist.



 When beginning treatment with TRELEGY ELLIPTA, patients who have been taking oral or inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonists on a regular basis (e.g., 4 times a day) should be instructed to discontinue the regular use of these drugs and to use them only for symptomatic relief of acute respiratory symptoms.



 COPD may deteriorate acutely over a period of hours or chronically over several days or longer. If TRELEGY ELLIPTA no longer controls symptoms of bronchoconstriction; the patient's inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist becomes less effective; or the patient needs more short-acting beta2-agonist than usual, these may be markers of deterioration of disease. In this setting a reevaluation of the patient and the COPD treatment regimen should be undertaken at once. Increasing the daily dose of TRELEGY ELLIPTA beyond the recommended dose is not appropriate in this situation.



    5.3 Excessive Use of TRELEGY ELLIPTA and Use with Other Long-acting Beta2-agonists



  TRELEGY ELLIPTA should not be used more often than recommended, at higher doses than recommended, or in conjunction with other medicines containing LABA, as an overdose may result. Clinically significant cardiovascular effects and fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs. Patients using TRELEGY ELLIPTA should not use another medicine containing a LABA (e.g., salmeterol, formoterol fumarate, arformoterol tartrate, indacaterol) for any reason.



    5.4 Local Effects of Inhaled Corticosteroids



  TRELEGY ELLIPTA contains fluticasone furoate, an ICS. Localized infections of the mouth and pharynx with Candida albicans  have occurred in subjects treated with orally inhaled drug products containing fluticasone furoate. When such an infection develops, it should be treated with appropriate local or systemic (i.e., oral) antifungal therapy while treatment with TRELEGY ELLIPTA continues, but at times therapy with TRELEGY ELLIPTA may need to be interrupted. Advise the patient to rinse his/her mouth with water without swallowing following inhalation to help reduce the risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis.



    5.5 Pneumonia



  Physicians should remain vigilant for the possible development of pneumonia in patients with COPD as clinical features of pneumonia and exacerbations frequently overlap. Lower respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia, have been reported following the inhaled administration of corticosteroids.



 In two 12-week trials of subjects with COPD (N = 824), the incidence of pneumonia was &lt;1% for both treatment arms: umeclidinium 62.5 mcg + fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 100 mcg/25 mcg or placebo + fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 100 mcg/25 mcg. Fatal pneumonia occurred in 1 subject receiving placebo + fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 100 mcg/25 mcg.



  In a 52-week trial of subjects with COPD (N = 10,355), the incidence of pneumonia was 8% for TRELEGY ELLIPTA (n = 4,151), 7% for fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 100 mcg/25 mcg (n = 4,134), and 5% for umeclidinium/vilanterol 62.5 mcg/25 mcg (n = 2,070). Fatal pneumonia occurred in 12 of 4,151 patients (0.35 per 100 patient-years) receiving TRELEGY ELLIPTA, 5 of 4,134 patients (0.17 per 100 patient-years) receiving fluticasone furoate/vilanterol, and 5 of 2,070 patients (0.29 per 100 patient-years) receiving umeclidinium/vilanterol.  



 In a mortality trial with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol with a median treatment duration of 1.5 years in 16,568 subjects with moderate COPD and cardiovascular disease, the annualized incidence rate of pneumonia was 3.4 per 100 patient-years for fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 100 mcg/25 mcg, 3.2 for placebo, 3.3 for fluticasone furoate 100 mcg, and 2.3 for vilanterol 25 mcg. Adjudicated, on-treatment deaths due to pneumonia occurred in 13 subjects receiving fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 100 mcg/25 mcg, 9 subjects receiving placebo, 10 subjects receiving fluticasone furoate 100 mcg, and 6 subjects receiving vilanterol 25 mcg (&lt;0.2 per 100 patient-years for each treatment group).



    5.6 Immunosuppression



  Persons who are using drugs that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids. In such children or adults who have not had these diseases or been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If a patient is exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If a patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.



 ICS should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculosis infections of the respiratory tract; systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex.



    5.7 Transferring Patients from Systemic Corticosteroid Therapy



  Particular care is needed for patients who have been transferred from systemically active corticosteroids to ICS because deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred in patients with asthma during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to less systemically available ICS. After withdrawal from systemic corticosteroids, a number of months are required for recovery of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function.



 Patients who have been previously maintained on 20 mg or more of prednisone (or its equivalent) may be most susceptible, particularly when their systemic corticosteroids have been almost completely withdrawn. During this period of HPA suppression, patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to trauma, surgery, or infection (particularly gastroenteritis) or other conditions associated with severe electrolyte loss. Although TRELEGY ELLIPTA may control COPD symptoms during these episodes, in recommended doses it supplies less than normal physiological amounts of glucocorticoid systemically and does NOT provide the mineralocorticoid activity that is necessary for coping with these emergencies.



 During periods of stress or a severe COPD exacerbation, patients who have been withdrawn from systemic corticosteroids should be instructed to resume oral corticosteroids (in large doses) immediately and to contact their physicians for further instruction. These patients should also be instructed to carry a warning card indicating that they may need supplementary systemic corticosteroids during periods of stress or a severe COPD exacerbation.



 Patients requiring oral corticosteroids should be weaned slowly from systemic corticosteroid use after transferring to TRELEGY ELLIPTA. Prednisone reduction can be accomplished by reducing the daily prednisone dose by 2.5 mg on a weekly basis during therapy with TRELEGY ELLIPTA. Lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1]), beta-agonist use, and COPD symptoms should be carefully monitored during withdrawal of oral corticosteroids. In addition, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, such as fatigue, lassitude, weakness, nausea and vomiting, and hypotension.



 Transfer of patients from systemic corticosteroid therapy to TRELEGY ELLIPTA may unmask allergic conditions previously suppressed by the systemic corticosteroid therapy (e.g., rhinitis, conjunctivitis, eczema, arthritis, eosinophilic conditions).



 During withdrawal from oral corticosteroids, some patients may experience symptoms of systemically active corticosteroid withdrawal (e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, depression) despite maintenance or even improvement of respiratory function.



    5.8 Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression



  Inhaled fluticasone furoate is absorbed into the circulation and can be systemically active. Effects of fluticasone furoate on the HPA axis are not observed with the therapeutic doses of fluticasone furoate in TRELEGY ELLIPTA. However, exceeding the recommended dosage or coadministration with a strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitor may result in HPA dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.9  ), Drug Interactions (  7.1  )]  .



 Because of the possibility of significant systemic absorption of ICS in sensitive patients, patients treated with TRELEGY ELLIPTA should be observed carefully for any evidence of systemic corticosteroid effects. Particular care should be taken in observing patients postoperatively or during periods of stress for evidence of inadequate adrenal response.



 It is possible that systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression (including adrenal crisis) may appear in a small number of patients who are sensitive to these effects. If such effects occur, appropriate therapy should be considered.



    5.9 Drug Interactions with Strong Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors



  Caution should be exercised when considering the coadministration of TRELEGY ELLIPTA with long-term ketoconazole and other known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, indinavir, itraconazole, lopinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin, voriconazole) because increased systemic corticosteroid and increased cardiovascular adverse effects may occur [see Drug Interactions (  7.1  ), Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )]  .



    5.10 Paradoxical Bronchospasm



  As with other inhaled medicines, TRELEGY ELLIPTA can produce paradoxical bronchospasm, which may be life threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs following dosing with TRELEGY ELLIPTA, it should be treated immediately with an inhaled, short-acting bronchodilator; TRELEGY ELLIPTA should be discontinued immediately; and alternative therapy should be instituted.



    5.11 Hypersensitivity Reactions, including Anaphylaxis



  Hypersensitivity reactions such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, and urticaria may occur after administration of TRELEGY ELLIPTA. Discontinue TRELEGY ELLIPTA if such reactions occur. There have been reports of anaphylactic reactions in patients with severe milk protein allergy after inhalation of other powder medications containing lactose; therefore, patients with severe milk protein allergy should not use TRELEGY ELLIPTA [see Contraindications (  4  )]  .



    5.12 Cardiovascular Effects



  Vilanterol, like other beta2-agonists, can produce a clinically significant cardiovascular effect in some patients as measured by increases in pulse rate, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, and also cardiac arrhythmias, such as supraventricular tachycardia and extrasystoles. If such effects occur, TRELEGY ELLIPTA may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta-agonists have been reported to produce electrocardiographic changes, such as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression, although the clinical significance of these findings is unknown [see Clinical Pharmacology (  12.2  )]  . Fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs.



 TRELEGY ELLIPTA, like other sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension.



  In a 52-week trial of subjects with COPD, the exposure-adjusted rates for any on-treatment major adverse cardiac event, including non-fatal central nervous system hemorrhages and cerebrovascular conditions, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), non-fatal acute MI, and adjudicated on-treatment death due to cardiovascular events, was 2.2 per 100 patient-years for TRELEGY ELLIPTA (n = 4,151), 1.9 per 100 patient-years for fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 100 mcg/25 mcg (n = 4,134), and 2.2 per 100 patient-years for umeclidinium/vilanterol 62.5 mcg/25 mcg (n = 2,070). Adjudicated on-treatment deaths due to cardiovascular events occurred in 20 of 4,151 patients (0.54 per 100 patient-years) receiving TRELEGY ELLIPTA, 27 of 4,134 patients (0.78 per 100 patient-years) receiving fluticasone furoate/vilanterol, and 16 of 2,070 patients (0.94 per 100 patient-years) receiving umeclidinium/vilanterol.  



 In a mortality trial with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol with a median treatment duration of 1.5 years in 16,568 subjects with moderate COPD and cardiovascular disease, the annualized incidence rate of adjudicated cardiovascular events (composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, unstable angina, transient ischemic attack, or on-treatment death due to cardiovascular events) was 2.5 per 100 patient-years for fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 100 mcg/25 mcg, 2.7 for placebo, 2.4 for fluticasone furoate 100 mcg, and 2.6 for vilanterol 25 mcg. Adjudicated, on-treatment deaths due to cardiovascular events occurred in 82 subjects receiving fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 100 mcg/25 mcg, 86 subjects receiving placebo, 80 subjects receiving fluticasone furoate 100 mcg, and 90 subjects receiving vilanterol 25 mcg (annualized incidence rate ranged from 1.2 to 1.3 per 100 patient-years for the treatment groups).



    5.13 Reduction in Bone Mineral Density



  Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) have been observed with long-term administration of products containing ICS. The clinical significance of small changes in BMD with regard to long-term consequences such as fracture is unknown. Patients with major risk factors for decreased bone mineral content, such as prolonged immobilization, family history of osteoporosis, postmenopausal status, tobacco use, advanced age, poor nutrition, or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass (e.g., anticonvulsants, oral corticosteroids) should be monitored and treated with established standards of care. Since patients with COPD often have multiple risk factors for reduced BMD, assessment of BMD is recommended prior to initiating TRELEGY ELLIPTA and periodically thereafter. If significant reductions in BMD are seen and TRELEGY ELLIPTA is still considered medically important for that patient's COPD therapy, use of medicine to treat or prevent osteoporosis should be strongly considered.



    5.14 Glaucoma and Cataracts, Worsening of Narrow-Angle Glaucoma



  Glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and cataracts have been reported in patients with COPD following the long-term administration of ICS or with use of inhaled anticholinergics. TRELEGY ELLIPTA should be used with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma. Prescribers and patients should also be alert for signs and symptoms of acute narrow-angle glaucoma (e.g., eye pain or discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion and corneal edema). Instruct patients to consult a healthcare provider immediately if any of these signs or symptoms develop. Close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, narrow- or open-angle glaucoma, and/or cataracts.



    5.15 Worsening of Urinary Retention



  TRELEGY ELLIPTA, like all medicines containing an anticholinergic, should be used with caution in patients with urinary retention. Prescribers and patients should be alert for signs and symptoms of urinary retention (e.g., difficulty passing urine, painful urination), especially in patients with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction. Instruct patients to consult a healthcare provider immediately if any of these signs or symptoms develop.



    5.16 Coexisting Conditions



  TRELEGY ELLIPTA, like all medicines containing sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with convulsive disorders or thyrotoxicosis and in those who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines. Doses of the related beta2-adrenoceptor agonist albuterol, when administered intravenously, have been reported to aggravate preexisting diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis.



    5.17 Hypokalemia and Hyperglycemia



  Beta-adrenergic agonist medicines may produce significant hypokalemia in some patients, possibly through intracellular shunting, which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects. The decrease in serum potassium is usually transient, not requiring supplementation. Beta-agonist medications may produce transient hyperglycemia in some patients.
