  Glaucoma with optic nerve damage, visual acuity and field defects; cataract formation; secondary ocular infection following suppression of host response; and perforation of the globe may occur.



   Clinical Studies Experience  



 In clinical studies with MAXIDEX, the most frequently reports adverse reactions were ocular discomfort occurring in approximately 10% of the patients and eye irritation occurring in approximately 1% of the patients. All other adverse reactions from these studies occurred with a frequency less than 1% including keratitis, conjunctivitis, dry eye, photophobia, blurred vision, eye pruritis, foreign body sensation, increased lacrimation, abnormal ocular sensation, eyelid margin crusting, and ocular hyperemia.



   Postmarketing Experience  



 Additional adverse reactions identified from post-marketing use include corneal erosion, dizziness, eye pain, eyelid ptosis, headache, hypersensitivity reactions, and mydriasis. Frequencies cannot be estimated from the available data.

   General



  FOR TOPICAL OPHTHALMIC USE. The possibility of persistent fungal infections of the cornea should be considered after prolonged corticosteroid dosing.



    Information for Patients



  Do not touch dropper tip to any surface, as this may contaminate the contents. The preservative in MAXIDEX  (r)  (dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension) 0.1%, benzalkonium chloride, may be absorbed by soft contact lenses. MAXIDEX  (r)  (dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension) 0.1% should not be administered while wearing soft contact lenses.



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility



  Long-term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential or the effect on fertility of MAXIDEX  (r)  (dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension) 0.1%.



    Pregnancy



  Dexamethasone has been shown to be teratogenic in mice and rabbits following topical ophthalmic application in multiples of the therapeutic dose. In the mouse, corticosteroids produce fetal resorptions and a specific abnormality, cleft palate. In the rabbit, corticosteroids have produced fetal resorptions and multiple abnormalities involving the head, ears, limbs, palate, etc.



 MAXIDEX(r) (dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension) 0.1% should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the embryo or fetus. There are no adequate or well-controlled studies in pregnant women. However, prolonged or repeated corticoid use during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of intra-uterine growth retardation. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy should be observed carefully for signs of hypoadrenalism.



    Nursing Mothers



  Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when MAXIDEX  (r)  (dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension) 0.1% is administered to a nursing woman.



    Pediatric Use



  The safety and effectiveness of MAXIDEX have been established in the pediatric patients. Use of MAXIDEX in all pediatric age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of MAXIDEX in adults with safety data from additional adequate and well controlled trials in pediatric patients.



    Geriatric Use



  No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients.

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings">    WARNINGS



  Prolonged use may result in ocular hypertension and/or glaucoma, with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision, and posterior subcapsular cataract formation. Prolonged use may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections. In acute purulent conditions or parasitic infections of the eye, corticosteroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection. In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical corticosteroids. If these products are used for 10 days or longer, intraocular pressure (IOP) should be routinely monitored even though it may be difficult in children and uncooperative patients.



 Employment of corticosteroid medication in the treatment of herpes simplex other than epithelial herpes simplex keratitis, in which it is contraindicated, requires great caution; periodic slit-lamp microscopy is essential.
