  The following serious adverse reactions are described, or described in greater detail, in other sections:

 *  Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )]  
 *  Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )]  
 *  Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  )]  
 *  Interactions with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.4  )]  
 *  Adrenal Insufficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.7  )]  
 *  Severe Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.8  )]  
 *  Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.10  )]  
 *  Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.11  )]  
 *  Withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.12  )]  
    The following adverse reactions associated with the use of morphine were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
 

 The major hazards of morphine, as with other narcotic analgesics, are respiratory depression, and to a lesser degree, circulatory depression, respiratory arrest, shock, and cardiac arrest have occurred, particularly with overdosage, rapid intravenous administration, and pre-existing hypovolemic shock. Rarely, anaphylactoid reactions have been reported when morphine or other phenanthrene alkaloids of opium are administered intravenously.

 The most frequently observed adverse reactions included sedation, lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and sweating. These effects seem to be more prominent in ambulatory patients and in those who are not experiencing severe pain. Some adverse reactions in ambulatory patients may be alleviated if the patient lies down  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.8  )]  .

 Other possible adverse reactions included:

   Central Nervous System  : Euphoria, dysphoria, weakness, headache, agitation, tremor, uncoordinated muscle movements, visual disturbances, transient hallucinations and disorientation.

   Gastrointestinal  : Constipation, biliary tract spasm.

   Cardiovascular  : Tachycardia, bradycardia, palpitation, faintness, syncope, and orthostatic hypotension.

   Genitourinary  : Oliguria and urinary retention; an antidiuretic effect has been reported.

   Allergic  : Allergic reactions to opioids occur infrequently; pruritus, urticaria and other skin rashes are most common. Rarely, anaphylactoid reactions have been reported following intravenous administration.

   Other  : Opioid-induced histamine release may be responsible for the flushing of the face, sweating, and pruritus often seen with these drugs. Wheals and urticaria at the site of injection are probably related to histamine release. Local tissue irritation, pain and induration have been reported following repeated subcutaneous injection. Morphine, like other opioids, may alter temperature regulation in susceptible individuals and will depress the cough reflex.

   Serotonin syndrome  : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs.

   Adrenal insufficiency  : Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use.

   Anaphylaxis  : Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in Morphine Sulfate Injection, (Auto-Injector).

   Androgen deficiency  : Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with chronic use of opioids  [see Clinical Pharmacology (  12.2  )]  .

   EXCERPT:   Most common adverse reactions (incidence &gt;5%) were sedation, lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and sweating. (  6  )

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings and precautions">   5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

   EXCERPT:    *   Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients : Monitor closely, particularly during initiation. (  5.5  ) 
 *   Adrenal Insufficiency : If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient off of the opioid. (  5.7  ) 
 *   Severe Hypotension : Monitor during dosage initiation and subsequent injections. Avoid use of Morphine Sulfate Injection, (Auto-Injector) in patients with circulatory shock. (  5.8  ) 
 *   Risk of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness : Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of Morphine Sulfate Injection, (Auto-Injector) in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. (  5.9  ) 
    
 

      5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse

     Morphine Sulfate Injection, (Auto-Injector) contains morphine sulfate, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, Morphine Sulfate Injection, (Auto-Injector) exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (  9  )].  

    Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed Morphine Sulfate Injection, (Auto-Injector). Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused.

    Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing Morphine Sulfate Injection, (Auto-Injector), and monitor all patients receiving Morphine Sulfate Injection, (Auto-Injector) for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as Morphine Sulfate Injection, (Auto-Injector), but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of Morphine Sulfate Injection, (Auto-Injector) along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse.

    Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing Morphine Sulfate Injection, (Auto-Injector). Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.

       5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression

     Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see Overdosage (  10  )]  . Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.

    Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing of Morphine Sulfate Injection, (Auto-Injector) is essential [see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  )]  .

       5.3 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome

     Prolonged use of Morphine Sulfate Injection, (Auto-Injector) during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  ), Patient Counseling Information (  17  )]  .

       5.4 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other Central Nervous System Depressants

     Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of Morphine Sulfate Injection, (Auto-Injector) with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.

    Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions (  7  )]  .

    If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.

    Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when Morphine Sulfate Injection, (Auto-Injector) is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [see Drug Interactions (  7  ), Patient Counseling Information (  17  )]  .

       5.5 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients

     The use of Morphine Sulfate Injection, (Auto-Injector) in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated.

       Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease  : Morphine Sulfate Injection, (Auto-Injector)-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of Morphine Sulfate Injection, (Auto-Injector) [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )].  

       Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients  : Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )]  .

    Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating Morphine Sulfate Injection, (Auto-Injector) and when Morphine Sulfate Injection, (Auto-Injector) is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )]  . Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients.

       5.6 Interaction with Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors

     Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) may potentiate the effects of morphine, including respiratory depression, coma, and confusion. Morphine Sulfate Injection, (Auto-Injector) should not be used in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment.

       5.7 Adrenal Insufficiency

     Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.

       5.8 Severe Hypotension

     Morphine Sulfate Injection, (Auto-Injector) may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (  7  )].  Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or administering subsequent injections of Morphine Sulfate Injection, (Auto-Injector). In patients with circulatory shock, Morphine Sulfate Injection, (Auto-Injector) may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of Morphine Sulfate Injection, (Auto-Injector) in patients with circulatory shock.

       5.9 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness

     In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), Morphine Sulfate Injection, (Auto-Injector) may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with Morphine Sulfate Injection, (Auto-Injector).

    Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of Morphine Sulfate Injection, (Auto-Injector) in patients with impaired consciousness or coma.

       5.10 Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions

     Morphine Sulfate Injection, (Auto-Injector) is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus.

    The morphine sulfate in Morphine Sulfate Injection, (Auto-Injector) may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms.

       5.11 Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders

     The morphine sulfate in Morphine Sulfate Injection, (Auto-Injector) may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during Morphine Sulfate Injection, (Auto-Injector) therapy.

       5.12 Withdrawal

     Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including Morphine Sulfate Injection, (Auto-Injector). In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.

       5.13 Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery

     Morphine Sulfate Injection, (Auto-Injector) may impair the mental and/or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of Morphine Sulfate Injection, (Auto-Injector) and know how they will react to the medication.

    5.14 Exposure, Hypothermia, Immersion, and Shock

  Caution must be used when injecting any opioid intramuscularly into chilled areas or in patients with hypotension or shock, since impaired perfusion may prevent complete absorption. If repeated injections are administered, an excessive amount may be suddenly absorbed if normal circulation is re-established.

    5.15 Accidental Activation

  Morphine Sulfate Injection, (Auto-Injector) contains a spring-driven injection mechanism and is capable of inflicting injury if accidentally misused. The product should remain in its original container with the safety in place until actually in use, and in no case should the product be carried with the red safety cap removed. Intramuscular or subcutaneous naloxone in the dosage of 0.4 mg is antidotal in case of accidental injection, but may have to be repeated at 30-60 minute intervals for several doses.
