  Clinical Trials Experience

 Cefotaxime for injection is generally well tolerated. The most common adverse reactions have been local reactions following IM or IV injection. Other adverse reactions have been encountered infrequently. The most frequent adverse reactions (greater than 1%) are: Local (4.3%) - Injection site inflammation with IV administration. Pain, induration, and tenderness after IM injection. Hypersensitivity (2.4%) - Rash, pruritus, fever, eosinophilia. Gastrointestinal (1.4%) - Colitis, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Symptoms of pseudomembranous colitis can appear during or after antibiotic treatment. Nausea and vomiting have been reported rarely. Less frequent adverse reactions (less than 1%) are: Hematologic System - Neutropenia, transient leukopenia, have been reported. Some individuals have developed positive direct Coombs Tests during treatment with cefotaxime for injection and other cephalosporin antibiotics.  Genitourinary System - Moniliasis, vaginitis. Central Nervous System - Headache. Liver - Transient elevations in AST, ALT, serum LDH, and serum alkaline phosphatase levels have been reported. Kidney - As with some other cephalosporins, transient elevations of BUN have been occasionally observed with cefotaxime for injection.   Post-Marketing Experience

 The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of cefotaxime for injection. Because these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiovascular System - Potentially life-threatening arrhythmias follow-ing rapid (less than 60 seconds) bolus administration via central venous catheter have been observed. Cutaneous - As with other cephalosporins, isolated cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and erythema multiforme have been reported. Hematologic System - Hemolytic anemia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia. Hypersensitivity - Anaphylaxis, urticaria. Kidney - Interstitial nephritis, transient elevations of creatinine. Liver - Hepatitis, jaundice, cholestasis, elevations of gamma GT and bilirubin.   Cephalosporin Class Labeling

 In addition to the adverse reactions listed above which have been observed in patients treated with cefotaxime sodium, the following adverse reactions and altered laboratory tests have been reported for cephalosporin class antibiotics: allergic reactions, hepatic dysfunction including cholestasis, aplastic anemia, hemorrhage, and false-positive test for urinary glucose. Several cephalosporins have been implicated in triggering seizures, particularly in patients with renal impairment when the dosage was not reduced. See    DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION     and    OVERDOSAGE    . If seizures associated with drug therapy occur, the drug should be discontinued. Anticonvulsant therapy can be given if clinically indicated.To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE EVENTS contact FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or  www.fda.gov/medwatch.

   General



    Prescribing cefotaxime in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Cefotaxime should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis. Because high and prolonged serum antibiotic concentrations can occur from usual doses in patients with transient or persistent reduction of urinary output because of renal insufficiency, the total daily dosage should be reduced when cefotaxime is administered to such patients. Continued dosage should be determined by degree of renal impairment, severity of infection, and susceptibility of the causative organism. Although there is no clinical evidence supporting the necessity of changing the dosage of cefotaxime sodium in patients with even profound renal dysfunction, it is suggested that, until further data are obtained, the dose of cefotaxime sodium be halved in patients with estimated creatinine clearances of less than 20 mL/min/1.73 m  2  . When only serum creatinine is available, the following formula  5  (based on sex, weight, and age of the patient) may be used to convert this value into creatinine clearance. The serum creatinine should represent a steady state of renal function.                                  Weight (kg) x (140 - age)           Males:                 72 x serum creatinine         Females:              0.85 x above value As with other antibiotics, prolonged use of cefotaxime may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Repeated evaluation of the patient's condition is essential. If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. As with other beta-lactam antibiotics, granulocytopenia and, more rarely, agranulocytosis may develop during treatment with cefotaxime, particularly if given over long periods. For courses of treatment lasting longer than 10 days, blood counts should therefore be monitored. Cefotaxime, like other parenteral anti-infective drugs, may be locally irritating to tissues. In most cases, perivascular extravasation of cefotaxime responds to changing of the infusion site. In rare instances, extensive perivascular extravasation of cefotaxime may result in tissue damage and require surgical treatment. To minimize the potential for tissue inflammation, infusion sites should be monitored regularly and changed when appropriate.    Information for Patients
 

    Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including cefotaxime should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When cefotaxime is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by cefotaxime or other antibacterial drugs in the future.Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.    Drug Interactions
 

    Increased nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant admin-istration of cephalosporins and aminoglycoside antibiotics.    Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions
 

    Cephalosporins, including cefotaxime sodium, are known to occasionally induce a positive direct Coombs' test.    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis
 

    Lifetime studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential have not been conducted. Cefotaxime was not mutagenic in the mouse micronucleus test or in the Ames' test. Cefotaxime did not impair fertility to rats when administered subcutaneously at doses up to 250 mg/kg/day (0.2 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/m  2  ) or in mice when administered intravenously at doses up to 2000 mg/kg/day (0.7 times the recommended human dose based on mg/m  2  ).    Pregnancy
 

   Teratogenic Effects



     Pregnancy Category B   Reproduction studies have been performed in pregnant mice given cefotaxime intravenously at doses up to 1200 mg/kg/day (0.4 times the recommended human dose based on mg/m  2  ) or in pregnant rats when administered intravenously at doses up to 1200 mg/kg/day (0.8 times the recommended human dose based on mg/m  2  ). No evidence of embryotoxicity or teratogenicity was seen in these studies. Although cefotaxime has been reported to cross the placental barrier and appear in cord blood, the effect on the human fetus is not known. There are no well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproductive studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.    Nonteratogenic Effects
 

    Use of the drug in women of child-bearing potential requires that the anticipated benefit be weighed against the possible risks. In perinatal and postnatal studies with rats, the pups in the group given 1200 mg/kg/day of cefotaxime were significantly lighter in weight at birth and remained smaller than pups in the control group during the 21 days of nursing.    Nursing Mothers
 

    Cefotaxime is excreted in human milk in low concentrations. Caution should be exercised when cefotaxime is administered to a nursing woman.    Pediatric Use
 

    See   PRECAUTIONS     above regarding perivascular extravasation.    Geriatric Use
 

    Of the 1409 subjects in clinical studies of cefotaxime, 632 (45%) were 65 and over, while 258 (18%) were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function (see   PRECAUTIONS, General    ).

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings">    WARNINGS



    BEFORE THERAPY WITH CEFOTAXIME IS INSTITUTED, CAREFUL INQUIRY SHOULD BE MADE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE PATIENT HAS HAD PREVIOUS HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS TO CEFOTAXIME SODIUM, CEPHALOSPORINS, PENICILLINS, OR OTHER DRUGS. THIS PRODUCT SHOULD BE GIVEN WITH CAUTION TO PATIENTS WITH TYPE I HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS TO PENICILLIN. ANTIBIOTICS SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED WITH CAUTION TO ANY PATIENT WHO HAS DEMONSTRATED SOME FORM OF ALLERGY, PARTICULARLY TO DRUGS. IF AN ALLERGIC REACTION TO CEFOTAXIME OCCURS, DISCONTINUE TREATMENT WITH THE DRUG. SERIOUS HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS MAY REQUIRE EPINEPHRINE AND OTHER EMERGENCY MEASURES. During post-marketing surveillance, a potentially life-threatening arrhythmia was reported in each of six patients who received a rapid (less than 60 seconds) bolus injection of cefotaxime through a central venous catheter. Therefore, cefotaxime should only be administered as instructed in the   DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION     section. Clostridium difficile  associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including cefotaxime, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile  . C. difficile  produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile  cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile  may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile  , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.
