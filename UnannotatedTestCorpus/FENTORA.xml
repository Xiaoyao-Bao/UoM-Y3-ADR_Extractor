  6.1 Clinical Studies Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The safety of FENTORA has been evaluated in 304 opioid-tolerant cancer patients with breakthrough pain. The average duration of therapy was 76 days with some patients being treated for over 12 months.



 The clinical trials of FENTORA were designed to evaluate safety and efficacy in treating patients with cancer and breakthrough pain; all patients were taking concomitant opioids, such as sustained-release morphine, sustained-release oxycodone or transdermal fentanyl, for their persistent pain.



 The adverse event data presented here reflect the actual percentage of patients experiencing each adverse effect among patients who received FENTORA for breakthrough pain along with a concomitant opioid for persistent pain. There has been no attempt to correct for concomitant use of other opioids, duration of FENTORA therapy or cancer-related symptoms.



 Table 2 lists, by maximum dose received, adverse events with an overall frequency of 5% or greater within the total population that occurred during titration. The ability to assign a dose-response relationship to these adverse events is limited by the titration schemes used in these studies.

             In addition, a small number of patients (n=11) with Grade 1 mucositis were included in clinical trials designed to support the safety of FENTORA. There was no evidence of excess toxicity in this subset of patients.
 

 Application Site Reactions: In clinical trials, 10% of all patients exposed to FENTORA reported application site reactions. These reactions ranged from paresthesias to ulceration and bleeding. Application site reactions occurring in &gt;=1% of patients were pain (4%), ulcer (3%), and irritation (3%). Application site reactions tended to occur early in treatment, were self-limited and only resulted in treatment discontinuation for 2% of patients.



 The duration of exposure to FENTORA varied greatly, and included open-label and double-blind studies. The frequencies listed below represent the &gt;=1% of patients (and not listed in Tables 2 and 3 above) from three clinical trials (titration and post-titration periods combined) who experienced that event while receiving FENTORA.

        Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression      



     Serious life-threatening and/or fatal respiratory depression has occurred in patients treated with FENTORA, including following use in opioid non-tolerant patients and improper dosing. Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of FENTORA or following a dose increase. The substitution of FENTORA for any other fentanyl product may result in fatal overdose   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )]  .    



   Due to the risk of respiratory depression, FENTORA is contraindicated in the management of acute or postoperative pain including headache/migraine and in opioid non-tolerant patients   [see Contraindications (  4  )]  .  



       Accidental Ingestion      



     Accidental ingestion of even one dose of FENTORA, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of fentanyl   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )]  .    



     Death has been reported in children who have accidentally ingested transmucosal immediate-release fentanyl products. FENTORA must be kept out of reach of children   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )]  .    



       Cytochrome P450 3A4 Interaction      



     The concomitant use of FENTORA with all cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse reactions and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. In addition, discontinuation of a concomitantly used cytochrome P450 3A4 inducer may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentration. Monitor patients receiving FENTORA and any CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  ), Drug Interactions (  7  )]  .    



       Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants      



     Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.4  ), Drug Interactions (  7  )]  .    



 *  Reserve concomitant prescribing of FENTORA and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. 
 *  Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. 
 *  Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. 
        Risk of Medication Errors    
 

   Substantial differences exist in the pharmacokinetic profile of FENTORA compared to other fentanyl products that result in clinically important differences in the extent of absorption of fentanyl and that could result in fatal overdose   [see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  ), Warnings and Precautions (  5.5  )]  .  



 *  When prescribing, do not convert patients on a mcg per mcg basis from any other fentanyl products to FENTORA [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. 
 *  When dispensing, do not substitute a FENTORA prescription for other fentanyl products. 
          Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse      
 

     FENTORA exposes patients and other users to the risks of opioid addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess each patient's risk prior to prescribing FENTORA, and monitor all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors or conditions   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.6   )]  .    



     Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Access Program    



   Because of the risk for misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose, FENTORA is available only through a restricted program required by the Food and Drug Administration, called a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). Under the Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) REMS Access program, outpatients, healthcare professionals who prescribe to outpatients, pharmacies, and distributors must enroll in the program   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.7  )]  . Further information is available at www.TIRFREMSAccess.com or by calling 1-866-822-1483.  



       Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome      



     Prolonged use of FENTORA during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.8  )]  .

   5.1 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression



   Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see Overdosage (  10  )]  . Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.  



  While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of FENTORA, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24-72 hours of initiating therapy with and following dosage increases of FENTORA.  



  To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of FENTORA are essential [see Dosage and Administration (  2.3  )]  . Overestimating the FENTORA dosage can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose. The substitution of FENTORA for any other fentanyl product may result in fatal overdose [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.5  )]  .  



   FENTORA could be fatal to individuals for whom it is not prescribed and for those who are not opioid-tolerant.    



  Accidental ingestion of even one dose of FENTORA, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of fentanyl.  



    5.2 Increased Risk of Overdose in Children Due to Accidental Ingestion or Exposure



   Death has been reported in children who have accidentally ingested transmucosal immediate-release fentanyl products.  



  Patients and their caregivers must be informed that FENTORA contains a medicine in an amount which can be fatal to a child. Healthcare providers and dispensing pharmacists must specifically question patients or caregivers about the presence of children in the home (on a full time or visiting basis) and counsel them regarding the dangers to children from inadvertent exposure.  



  Patients and their caregivers must be instructed to keep both used and unused dosage units out of the reach of children. While all units should be disposed of immediately after use, partially consumed units represent a special risk to children. In the event that a unit is not completely consumed it must be properly disposed as soon as possible [see Patient Counseling Information (  17  )]  .  



  Detailed instructions for the proper storage, administration, disposal, and important instructions for managing an overdose of FENTORA are provided in the FENTORA Medication Guide  . Encourage patients to read this information in its entirety and give them an opportunity to have their questions answered.  



    5.3 Risks of Concomitant Use or Discontinuation of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers



   Concomitant use of FENTORA with a CYP3A4 inhibitor, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may increase plasma concentrations of fentanyl and prolong opioid adverse reactions, which may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )]  , particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of FENTORA is achieved. Similarly, discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inducer, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, in FENTORA-treated patients may increase fentanyl plasma concentrations and prolong opioid adverse reactions. When using FENTORA with CYP3A4 inhibitors or discontinuing CYP3A4 inducers in FENTORA-treated patients, monitor patients closely at frequent intervals and consider dosage reduction of FENTORA until stable drug effects are achieved [see Drug Interactions (  7  )]  .  



  Concomitant use of FENTORA with CYP3A4 inducers or discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inhibitor could decrease fentanyl plasma concentrations, decrease opioid efficacy or, possibly, lead to a withdrawal syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to fentanyl. When using FENTORA with CYP3A4 inducers or discontinuing CYP3A4 inhibitors, monitor patients closely at frequent intervals and consider increasing the opioid dosage if needed to maintain adequate analgesia or if symptoms of opioid withdrawal occur [see Drug Interactions (  7  )]  .  



    5.4 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants (including Alcohol)



   Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of FENTORA with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.  



  Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions (  7  )]  .  



  If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.  



  Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when FENTORA is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [see Drug Interactions (  7  ) and Patient Counseling Information (  17  )]  .  



    5.5 Risk of Medication Errors



  When prescribing, do not convert a patient to FENTORA from any other fentanyl product on a mcg per mcg basis as FENTORA and other fentanyl products are not equivalent on a microgram per microgram basis.



 FENTORA is not a generic version of other transmucosal immediate release fentanyl (TIRF) formulations. When dispensing, do not substitute a FENTORA prescription for any other TIRF formulation under any circumstances. Other TIRF formulations and FENTORA are not equivalent. Substantial differences exist in the pharmacokinetic profile of FENTORA compared to other fentanyl products including other TIRF formulations that result in clinically important differences in the rate and extent of absorption of fentanyl. As a result of these differences, the substitution of FENTORA or any other fentanyl product may result in a fatal overdose.



 There are no safe conversion directions available for patients on any other fentanyl products except ACTIQ (Note: This includes oral, transdermal, or parenteral formulations of fentanyl.) [see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  )]  .Therefore, for opioid tolerant patients, the initial dose of FENTORA should always be 100 mcg. Individually titrate each patient's dose to provide adequate analgesia while minimizing side effects [see Dosage and Administration (  2.3  )]  .



    5.6 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse



   FENTORA contains fentanyl, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, FENTORA exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (  9  )]  .  



  Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed FENTORA. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused.  



  Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing FENTORA, and monitor all patients receiving FENTORA for the development of these behaviors or conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as FENTORA, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of FENTORA along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse.  



  Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing FENTORA. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see Patient Counseling Information (  17  )]  . Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.  



    5.7 Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Access Program



  Because of the risk for misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (  9  )]  , FENTORA is available only through a restricted program called the TIRF REMS Access program. Under the TIRF REMS Access program, outpatients, healthcare professionals who prescribe for outpatient use, pharmacies, and distributors must enroll in the program. For inpatient administration (e.g., hospitals, hospices, and long-term care facilities that prescribe for inpatient use) of FENTORA, patient and prescriber enrollment is not required.



 Required components of the TIRF REMS Access program are:



 *  Healthcare professionals, who prescribe FENTORA for outpatient use, must review the prescriber educational materials for the TIRF REMS Access program, enroll in the program, and comply with the REMS requirements. 
 *  To receive FENTORA, outpatients must understand the risks and benefits and sign a Patient-Prescriber Agreement. 
 *  Pharmacies that dispense FENTORA must enroll in the program and agree to comply with the REMS requirements. 
 *  Wholesalers and distributors that distribute FENTORA must enroll in the program, and distribute only to authorized pharmacies. 
 *  Further information, including a list of qualified pharmacies/distributors, is available at www.TIRFREMSAccess.com or by calling 1-866-822-1483. 
       5.8 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome
 

   Prolonged use of FENTORA during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  ), Patient Counseling Information (  17  )]  .  



    5.9 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients



   The use of FENTORA in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated.  



   Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease:  FENTORA-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of FENTORA [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )]  .  



   Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients:  Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )]  .  



  Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating FENTORA and when FENTORA is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )]  . Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients.  



    5.10 Serotonin Syndrome with Concomitant Use of Serotonergic Drugs



   Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of FENTORA with serotonergic drugs. Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including MAO inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue) [see Drug Interactions (  7  )]  . This may occur within the recommended dosage range.  



  Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days of concomitant use, but may occur later than that. Discontinue FENTORA if serotonin syndrome is suspected.  



    5.11 Adrenal Insufficiency



   Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.  



    5.12 Severe Hypotension



   FENTORA may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g. phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (  7  )]  . Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of FENTORA. In patients with circulatory shock, FENTORA may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of FENTORA in patients with circulatory shock.  



    5.13 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness



   In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), FENTORA may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with FENTORA.  



  Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of FENTORA in patients with impaired consciousness or coma.  



    5.14 Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions



   FENTORA is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus.  



  The fentanyl in FENTORA may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsening symptoms.  



    5.15 Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders



   The fentanyl in FENTORA may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during FENTORA therapy.  



    5.16 Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery



   FENTORA may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of FENTORA and know how they will react to the medication.  



    5.17 Cardiac Disease



  Intravenous fentanyl may produce bradycardia. Therefore, use FENTORA with caution in patients with bradyarrhythmias.



    5.18 Application Site Reactions



  Application site reactions occurred in 10% of patients in clinical trials and ranged from paresthesia to ulceration and bleeding [see Adverse Reactions (  6  )]  .



    5.19 MAO Inhibitors



  FENTORA is not recommended for use in patients who have received MAO inhibitors within 14 days, because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions (  7  )]  .
