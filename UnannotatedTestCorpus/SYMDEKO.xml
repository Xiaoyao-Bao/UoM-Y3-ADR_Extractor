  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 The overall safety profile of SYMDEKO is based on data from three double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 clinical trials: 2 parallel-group trials of 12 and 24 week duration and one cross-over design trial of 8 weeks duration. Eligible patients were also able to participate in an open-label extension safety study (up to 96 weeks of SYMDEKO). In the three placebo-controlled Phase 3 trials (Trials 1, 2, and 3), a total of 496 patients with CF aged 12 years and older received at least one dose of SYMDEKO. The proportion of patients who discontinued study drug prematurely due to adverse events was 1.6% for SYMDEKO-treated patients and 2.0% for placebo-treated patients. Serious adverse reactions, whether considered drug-related or not by the investigators, that occurred more frequently in SYMDEKO-treated patients compared to placebo included distal intestinal obstruction syndrome, 3 (0.6%) SYMDEKO-treated subjects vs. 0 placebo. There were no deaths in the placebo controlled trials, and one death in the open label extension study due to respiratory failure and influenza infection in a patient who had discontinued SYMDEKO seven weeks prior.



 The safety profile of SYMDEKO was generally similar across all subgroups of patients, including analysis by age, sex, baseline percent predicted FEV1(ppFEV1), and geographic regions.



 Table 3 shows adverse reactions occurring in &gt;=3% of SYMDEKO-treated patients that also occurred at a higher rate than in the placebo-treated patients in the 12- and 24-week placebo controlled, parallel-group Phase 3 trials (Trials 1 and 3).

 Adverse Reactions (Preferred Term)                      SYMDEKON=334n (%)          PlaceboN=343n (%)       
  
 Headache                                                     49 (15)                    44 (13)            
 Nausea                                                       29 (9)                     24 (7)             
 Sinus congestion                                             13 (4)                      6 (2)             
 Dizziness                                                    12 (4)                      8 (2)             
         The safety profile for the CF patients enrolled in Trial 2 who were heterozygous for the  F508del  mutation and a second mutation predicted to be responsive to tezacaftor/ivacaftor was similar to that observed in Trials 1 and 3.
 

     Laboratory abnormalities  



     Transaminase elevations  



 During the placebo-controlled Phase 3 trials, the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) &gt;8, &gt;5, or &gt;3 * the upper limit of normal (ULN) was similar between SYMDEKO-treated patients and placebo-treated patients; 0.2%, 1.0%, and 3.4% in SYMDEKO-treated patients, and 0.4%, 1.0%, and 3.4% in placebo-treated patients. One patient (0.2%) on SYMDEKO and 2 patients (0.4%) on placebo permanently discontinued treatment for elevated transaminases. No SYMDEKO-treated patients experienced a transaminase elevation &gt;3 * ULN associated with elevated total bilirubin &gt;2 * ULN.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Elevated transaminases (ALT or AST): Transaminases (ALT and AST) should be assessed prior to initiating SYMDEKO, every 3 months during the first year of treatment, and annually thereafter. In patients with a history of transaminase elevations, more frequent monitoring should be considered. Dosing should be interrupted in patients with significant elevations of transaminases, e.g., patients with ALT or AST &gt;5 * upper limit of normal (ULN), or ALT or AST &gt;3 * ULN with bilirubin &gt;2 * ULN. Following resolution of transaminase elevations, consider the benefits and risks of resuming treatment. (  5.1  ,  6  ) 
 *  Use with CYP3A inducers: Concomitant use with strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin, St. John's wort) substantially decrease exposure of ivacaftor and may decrease the exposure of tezacaftor, which may reduce therapeutic effectiveness. Therefore, co-administration is not recommended. (  5.2  ,  7.1  ,  12.3  ) 
 *  Cataracts: Non-congenital lens opacities/cataracts have been reported in pediatric patients treated with SYMDEKO. Baseline and follow-up examinations are recommended in pediatric patients initiating SYMDEKO treatment. (  5.3  ,  8.4  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Transaminase (AST/ALT) Elevations



  Elevated transaminases have been observed in patients with CF treated with SYMDEKO, as well as with ivacaftor monotherapy. Assessments of transaminases (ALT and AST) are recommended for all patients prior to initiating SYMDEKO, every 3 months during the first year of treatment, and annually thereafter. For patients with a history of transaminase elevations more frequent monitoring should be considered. In the event of significant elevations of transaminases, e.g., patients with ALT or AST &gt;5 * upper limit of normal (ULN), or ALT or AST &gt;3 * ULN with bilirubin &gt;2 * ULN, dosing should be interrupted and laboratory tests closely followed until the abnormalities resolve. Following the resolution of transaminase elevations consider the benefits and risks of resuming treatment [see  Adverse Reactions (6)  ]  .



    5.2 Concomitant Use with CYP3A Inducers



  Exposure to ivacaftor is significantly decreased and exposure to tezacaftor may be reduced by the concomitant use of CYP3A inducers, which may reduce the therapeutic effectiveness of SYMDEKO. Therefore, co-administration with strong CYP3A inducers is not recommended [see  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ,  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  , and  Patient Counseling Information (17)  ]  .



    5.3 Cataracts



  Cases of non-congenital lens opacities have been reported in pediatric patients treated with SYMDEKO, as well as with ivacaftor monotherapy. Although other risk factors were present in some cases (such as corticosteroid use, exposure to radiation), a possible risk attributable to treatment with SYMDEKO cannot be excluded. Baseline and follow-up ophthalmological examinations are recommended in pediatric patients initiating treatment with SYMDEKO [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.4)  and  Patient Counseling Information (17)  ]  .
