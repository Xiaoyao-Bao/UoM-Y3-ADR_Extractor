(5.14, 8.1) 
    
 

      Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse     



     ZUTRIPRO exposes patients and other users to the risks of opioid addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death.  Reserve ZUTRIPRO for use in adult patients for whom the benefits of cough suppression are expected to outweigh the risks, and in whom an adequate assessment of the etiology of the cough has been made.  Assess each patient's risk prior to prescribing ZUTRIPRO, prescribe ZUTRIPRO for the shortest duration that is consistent with individual patient treatment goals  ,   monitor all patients regularly for the development of addition or abuse, and refill only after reevaluation of the need for continued treatment. [  see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)    ]    



       Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression    



     Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of ZUTRIPRO.  Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of ZUTRIPRO therapy or when used in patients at higher risk [  see   Warnings and Precautions (5.2)    ]  .      



       Accidental Ingestion     



     Accidental ingestion of even one dose of ZUTRIPRO, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of hydrocodone [  see   Warnings and Precautions (5.2)    ].     



       Risk of Medication Errors    



     Ensure accuracy when prescribing, dispensing, and administering ZUTRIPRO.  Dosing errors can result in accidental overdose and death.  Always use an accurate milliliter measuring device when measuring and administering ZUTRIPRO [  see   Dosage and Administration (2.1)  ,   Warnings and Precautions (5.5)    ].    



       Cytochrome P450 3A4 Interaction     



     The concomitant use of ZUTRIPRO with all cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may result in an increase in hydrocodone plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.  In addition, discontinuation of a concomitantly used cytochrome P450 3A4 inducer may result in an increase in hydrocodone plasma concentration.  Avoid the use of ZUTRIPRO in patients taking a CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer [  see   Warnings and Precautions (5.7)  ,   Drug Interactions (7.2  ,   7.3)    ].    



     Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants  



   Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death  .    Avoid the use of ZUTRIPRO in patients taking benzodiazepines, other CNS depressants, or alcohol.  [  see   Warning and Precautions (5.8)  ,   Drug Interactions (7.5)    ]  



       Interaction with Alcohol     



     Instruct patients not to consume alcoholic beverages or use prescription or non-prescription products that contain alcohol while taking ZUTRIPRO.  The co-ingestion of alcohol with ZUTRIPRO may result in increased plasma levels and a potentially fatal overdose of hydrocodone [  see   Warnings and Precautions (5.8)   and   Drug Interactions (7.1    ].    



       Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome    



     ZUTRIPRO is not recommended for use in pregnant women [  see   Use in Specific Populations (8.1)    ].  Prolonged use of ZUTRIPRO during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts.  If ZUTRIPRO is used for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [  see   Warnings and Precautions (5.14)    ]

   5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse



   ZUTRIPRO contains hydrocodone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, ZUTRIPRO exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [ see  Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)    ] ,  which can lead to overdose and death [ see  Overdosage (10)    ] .   Reserve ZUTRIPRO for use in adult patients for whom the benefits of cough suppression are expected to outweigh the risks, and in whom an adequate assessment of the etiology of the cough has been made. Assess each patient's risk prior to prescribing ZUTRIPRO, prescribe ZUTRIPRO for the shortest duration that is consistent with individual patient treatment goals ,  monitor all patients regularly for the development of addiction or abuse, and refill only after reevaluation of the need for continued treatment.    



  Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed ZUTRIPRO. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression).  



  Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing ZUTRIPRO. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [ see  Patient Counseling Information (17)    ]. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.  



    5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression



   Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, including hydrocodone, one of the active ingredients in ZUTRIPRO. Hydrocodone produces dose-related respiratory depression by directly acting on the brain stem respiratory center that controls respiratory rhythm and may produce irregular and periodic breathing. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression includes discontinuation of ZUTRIPRO, close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists (e.g. naloxone), depending on the patient's clinical status [ see  Overdosage (10)    ]. Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.  



  While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of ZUTRIPRO, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy, when ZUTRIPRO is used concomitantly with other drugs that may cause respiratory depression [ see  Warnings and Precautions (5.7)    ], in patients with chronic pulmonary disease or decreased respiratory reserve, and in patients with altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance (e.g. elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients) [ see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)    ].  



  To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing of ZUTRIPRO is essential [ see  Dosage and Administration (2.1)  ,  Warnings and Precautions (5.5)    ]. Monitor patients closely, especially within the first 24-72 hours of initiating therapy or when used in patients at higher risk.  



  Overdose of hydrocodone in adults has been associated with fatal respiratory depression, and the use of hydrocodone in children younger than 6 years of age has been associated with fatal respiratory depression when used as recommended. Accidental ingestion of even one dose of ZUTRIPRO, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death.  



    5.3 Risks with Use in Pediatric Populations



   Children are particularly sensitive to the respiratory depressant effects of hydrocodone [ see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)    ]. Because of the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression and death, ZUTRIPRO is contraindicated in children less than 6 years of age [ see  Contraindications (4)    ].  



  Use of ZUTRIPRO in children also exposes them to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [ see  Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)    ] ,  which can lead to overdose and death [ see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ,  Overdosage (10)    ] .  Because the benefits of symptomatic treatment of cough associated with allergies or the common cold do not outweigh the risks of use of hydrocodone in pediatric patients, ZUTRIPRO is not indicated for use in patients younger than 18 years of age [ see  Indications (1)  ,  Use in Specific Populations (8.4)    ].  



    5.4 Risks with Use in Other At-Risk Populations



    Unresponsive Cough    



  The dosage of ZUTRIPRO should not be increased if cough fails to respond; an unresponsive cough should be reevaluated in 5 days or sooner for possible underlying pathology, such as foreign body or lower respiratory tract disease [ see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)    ].  



     Asthma and Other Pulmonary Disease    



  The use of ZUTRIPRO in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated [ see  Contraindications (4)    ].  



  Opioid analgesics and antitussives, including hydrocodone, one of the active ingredients in ZUTRIPRO, should not be used in patients with acute febrile illness associated with productive cough or in patients with chronic respiratory disease where interference with ability to clear the tracheobronchial tree of secretions would have a deleterious effect on the patient's respiratory function.  



  ZUTRIPRO-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of ZUTRIPRO [ see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)    ] .    



     Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients  : Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [ see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)    ].  



  Because of the risk of respiratory depression, avoid the use of opioid antitussives, including ZUTRIPRO in patients with compromised respiratory function, patients at risk of respiratory failure, and in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients. If ZUTRIPRO is prescribed, monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating ZUTRIPRO and when ZUTRIPRO is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [ see  Warnings and Precautions (5.8)    ].  



    5.5 Risk of Accidental Overdose and Death due to Medication Errors



   Dosing errors can result in accidental overdose and death. To reduce the risk of overdose and respiratory depression, ensure that the dose of ZUTRIPRO is communicated clearly and dispensed accurately [ see  Dosage and Administration (2.1)    ].  



 Advise patients to always use an accurate milliliter measuring device when measuring and administering ZUTRIPRO. Inform patients that household teaspoon is not an accurate measuring device and such use could lead to overdosage and serious adverse reactions [ see  Overdosage (10)    ]. For prescriptions where a measuring device is not provided, a pharmacist can provide an appropriate calibrated measuring device and can provide instructions for measuring the correct dose.



    5.6 Activities Requiring Mental Alertness: Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery



  Hydrocodone and chlorpheniramine, two of the active ingredients in ZUTRIPRO, may produce marked drowsiness and impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery. Advise patients to avoid engaging in hazardous tasks requiring mental alertness and motor coordination after ingestion of ZUTRIPRO. Avoid concurrent use of ZUTRIPRO with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants because additional impairment of central nervous system performance may occur [ see  Warnings and Precautions (5.8)    ] .  



    5.7 Risks from Concomitant Use or Discontinuation of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers



   Concomitant use of ZUTRIPRO with a CYP3A4 inhibitor, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may increase plasma concentrations of hydrocodone and prolong opioid adverse reactions, which may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression [ see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)    ], particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of ZUTRIPRO is achieved. Similarly, discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inducer, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, in ZUTRIPRO-treated patients may increase hydrocodone plasma concentrations and prolong opioid adverse reactions.  



  Concomitant use of ZUTRIPRO with CYP3A4 inducers or discontinuation of an CYP3A4 inhibitor could decrease hydrocodone plasma concentrations, decrease opioid efficacy or, possibly, lead to a withdrawal syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to hydrocodone.  



  Avoid the use of ZUTRIPRO in patients who are taking a CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer. If concomitant use of ZUTRIPRO with a CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer is necessary, monitor patients for signs and symptoms that may reflect opioid toxicity and opioid withdrawal [ see  Drug Interactions (7.2  ,  7.3)    ].  



    5.8 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or other CNS Depressants



  Concomitant use of opioids, including ZUTRIPRO, with benzodiazepines, or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, avoid use of opioid cough medications in patients taking benzodiazepines, other CNS depressants, or alcohol [ see  Drug Interactions (7.5)    ].



 Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. Because of similar pharmacologic properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with concomitant use of opioid cough medications and benzodiazepines, other CNS depressants, or alcohol.



 Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation if ZUTRIPRO is used with benzodiazepines, alcohol, or other CNS depressants [ see  Patient Counseling Information (17)    ] .  



  Patients must not consume alcoholic beverages, or prescription or non-prescription products containing alcohol, while on ZUTRIPRO therapy. The co-ingestion of alcohol with ZUTRIPRO may result in increased plasma levels and a potentially fatal overdose of hydrocodone [ see  Drug Interactions (7.1  ,  7.5)    ].  



    5.9 Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions



   ZUTRIPRO is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus [ see  Contraindications (4)    ]. The use of hydrocodone in ZUTRIPRO may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions.  



 The concurrent use of anticholinergics with ZUTRIPRO may produce paralytic ileus [ see  Drug Interactions (7.10)    ].



  The hydrocodone in ZUTRIPRO may result in constipation or obstructive bowel disease, especially in patients with underlying intestinal motility disorders. Use with caution in patients with underlying intestinal motility disorders.  



  The hydrocodone in ZUTRIPRO may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, resulting in an increase in biliary tract pressure. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase [ see  Warnings and Precautions (5.16)    ]. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsening symptoms.  



    5.10 Risks of Use in Patients with Head Injury, Impaired Consciousness, Increased Intracranial Pressure, or Brain Tumors



  Avoid the use of ZUTRIPRO in patients with head injury, intracranial lesions, or a pre-existing increase in intracranial pressure. In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), ZUTRIPRO may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Furthermore, opioids produce adverse reactions that may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injuries.



    5.11 Cardiovascular and Central Nervous System Effects



  The pseudoephedrine contained in ZUTRIPRO can produce cardiovascular and central nervous system effects in some patients such as, insomnia, dizziness, weakness, tremor, transient elevations in blood pressure, or arrhythmias. In addition, central nervous system stimulation with convulsions or cardiovascular collapse with accompanying hypotension has been reported. Therefore, ZUTRIPRO is contraindicated in patients with severe hypertension or coronary artery disease [ see  Contraindications (4)    ], and should, be used with caution in patients with other cardiovascular disorders.



    5.12 Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders



   The hydrocodone and chlorpheniramine in ZUTRIPRO may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during ZUTRIPRO therapy.  



    5.13 Severe Hypotension



   ZUTRIPRO may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [ see  Drug Interactions (7.5)    ] .  Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating ZUTRIPRO.  



  In patients with circulatory shock, ZUTRIPRO may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of ZUTRIPRO in patients with circulatory shock.  



    5.14 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome



   ZUTRIPRO is not recommended for use in pregnant women. Prolonged use of ZUTRIPRO during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available. [ see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ,  Patient Counseling Information (17)    ]  



    5.15 Adrenal Insufficiency



   Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.  



    5.16 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions



   Because opioid agonists may increase biliary tract pressure, with resultant increase in plasma amylase or lipase levels, determination of these enzyme levels may be unreliable for 24 hours after administration of a dose of ZUTRIPRO.
