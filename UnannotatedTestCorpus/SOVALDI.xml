  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

 When SOVALDI is administered with ribavirin or peginterferon alfa/ribavirin, refer to the respective prescribing information for a description of adverse reactions associated with their use.

     Adverse Reactions in Adult Subjects  

 The safety assessment of SOVALDI was based on pooled Phase 3 clinical trial data (both controlled and uncontrolled) including:

 *  650 subjects who received SOVALDI + ribavirin (RBV) combination therapy for 12 weeks, 
 *  98 subjects who received SOVALDI + ribavirin combination therapy for 16 weeks, 
 *  250 subjects who received SOVALDI + ribavirin combination therapy for 24 weeks, 
 *  327 subjects who received SOVALDI + peginterferon (Peg-IFN) alfa + ribavirin combination therapy for 12 weeks, 
 *  243 subjects who received peginterferon alfa + ribavirin for 24 weeks, and 
 *  71 subjects who received placebo (PBO) for 12 weeks [see  Clinical Studies (14)  ] . 
    The proportion of subjects who permanently discontinued treatment due to adverse events was 4% for subjects receiving placebo, 1% for subjects receiving SOVALDI + ribavirin for 12 weeks, less than 1% for subjects receiving SOVALDI + ribavirin for 24 weeks, 11% for subjects receiving peginterferon alfa + ribavirin for 24 weeks and 2% for subjects receiving SOVALDI + peginterferon alfa + ribavirin for 12 weeks.
 

 Adverse events observed in at least 15% of subjects in the Phase 3 clinical trials outlined above are provided in Table 4. A side-by-side tabulation is displayed to simplify presentation; direct comparison across trials should not be made due to differing trial designs.

 The most common adverse events (at least 20%) for SOVALDI + ribavirin combination therapy were fatigue and headache. The most common adverse events (at least 20%) for SOVALDI + peginterferon alfa + ribavirin combination therapy were fatigue, headache, nausea, insomnia and anemia.

            With the exception of anemia and neutropenia, the majority of events presented in Table 4 occurred at severity of grade 1 in SOVALDI-containing regimens.
 

       Less Common Adverse Reactions Reported in Clinical Trials (less than 1%):    The following adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% of subjects receiving SOVALDI in a combination regimen in any one trial. These events have been included because of their seriousness or assessment of potential causal relationship.

   Hematologic Effects:  pancytopenia (particularly in subjects receiving concomitant pegylated interferon).

   Psychiatric Disorders:  severe depression (particularly in subjects with pre-existing history of psychiatric illness), including suicidal ideation and suicide.

   Laboratory Abnormalities:

 Changes in selected hematological parameters are described in Table 5. A side-by-side tabulation is displayed to simplify presentation; direct comparison across trials should not be made due to differing trial designs.

                Bilirubin Elevations  
 

 Total bilirubin elevation of more than 2.5*ULN was observed in none of the subjects in the SOVALDI + peginterferon alfa + ribavirin 12 weeks group and in 1%, 3% and 3% of subjects in the peginterferon alfa + ribavirin 24 weeks, SOVALDI + ribavirin 12 weeks and SOVALDI + ribavirin 24 weeks groups, respectively. Bilirubin levels peaked during the first 1 to 2 weeks of treatment and subsequently decreased and returned to baseline levels by post-treatment Week 4. These bilirubin elevations were not associated with transaminase elevations.

     Creatine Kinase Elevations  

 Creatine kinase was assessed in the FISSION and NEUTRINO trials. Isolated, asymptomatic creatine kinase elevation of greater than or equal to 10*ULN was observed in less than 1%, 1% and 2% of subjects in the peginterferon alfa + ribavirin 24 weeks, SOVALDI + peginterferon alfa + ribavirin 12 weeks and SOVALDI + ribavirin 12 weeks groups, respectively.

     Lipase Elevations  

 Isolated, asymptomatic lipase elevation of greater than 3*ULN was observed in less than 1%, 2%, 2%, and 2% of subjects in the SOVALDI + peginterferon alfa + ribavirin 12 weeks, SOVALDI + ribavirin 12 weeks, SOVALDI + ribavirin 24 weeks and peginterferon alfa + ribavirin 24 weeks groups, respectively.

     Patients with HCV/HIV-1 Coinfection  

 SOVALDI used in combination with ribavirin was assessed in 223 HCV/HIV-1 coinfected subjects  [see  Clinical Studies (14.4)  ]  . The safety profile in HCV/HIV-1 coinfected subjects was similar to that observed in HCV mono-infected subjects. Elevated total bilirubin (grade 3 or 4) was observed in 30/32 (94%) subjects receiving atazanavir as part of the antiretroviral regimen. None of the subjects had concomitant transaminase increases. Among subjects not taking atazanavir, grade 3 or 4 elevated total bilirubin was observed in 2 (1.5%) subjects, similar to the rate observed with HCV mono-infected subjects receiving SOVALDI + ribavirin in Phase 3 trials.

     Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Subjects 12 Years of Age and Older  

 The safety assessment of SOVALDI in pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older is based on data from 50 subjects who were treated with SOVALDI plus ribavirin for 12 weeks (genotype 2 subjects) or 24 weeks (genotype 3 subjects) in a Phase 2, open-label clinical trial. The adverse reactions observed were consistent with those observed in clinical studies of SOVALDI plus ribavirin in adults  [see  Clinical Studies 14.5)  ]  .

   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of SOVALDI. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

     Cardiac Disorders  

 Serious symptomatic bradycardia has been reported in patients taking amiodarone who initiate treatment with a sofosbuvir-containing regimen  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ,  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ].

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: RISK OF HEPATITIS B VIRUS REACTIVATION IN PATIENTS COINFECTED WITH HCV AND HBV

  WARNING: RISK OF HEPATITIS B VIRUS REACTIVATION IN PATIENTS COINFECTED WITH HCV AND HBV

      Test all patients for evidence of current or prior hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection before initiating treatment with SOVALDI. HBV reactivation has been reported in HCV/HBV coinfected patients who were undergoing or had completed treatment with HCV direct acting antivirals and were not receiving HBV antiviral therapy. Some cases have resulted in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death. Monitor HCV/HBV coinfected patients for hepatitis flare or HBV reactivation during HCV treatment and post-treatment follow-up. Initiate appropriate patient management for HBV infection as clinically indicated   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  .    

   EXCERPT:   WARNING: RISK OF HEPATITIS B VIRUS REACTIVATION IN PATIENTS COINFECTED WITH HCV AND HBV

     See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.    

   Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation has been reported, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death. (  5.1  )  

 

</Section>
    <Section id="S3" name="warnings and precautions">   5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

   EXCERPT:    *  Risk of Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation: Test all patients for evidence of current or prior HBV infection before initiation of HCV treatment. Monitor HCV/HBV coinfected patients for HBV reactivation and hepatitis flare during HCV treatment and post-treatment follow-up. Initiate appropriate patient management for HBV infection as clinically indicated. (  5.1  ) 
 *  Bradycardia with amiodarone coadministration: Serious symptomatic bradycardia may occur in patients taking amiodarone with a sofosbuvir-containing regimen, particularly in patients also receiving beta blockers, or those with underlying cardiac comorbidities and/or advanced liver disease. Coadministration of amiodarone with SOVALDI is not recommended. In patients without alternative, viable treatment options, cardiac monitoring is recommended. (  5.2  ,  6.2  ,  7.1  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Risk of Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation in Patients Coinfected with HCV and HBV

   Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation has been reported in HCV/HBV coinfected patients who were undergoing or had completed treatment with HCV direct acting antivirals, and who were not receiving HBV antiviral therapy. Some cases have resulted in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death. Cases have been reported in patients who are HBsAg positive and also in patients with serologic evidence of resolved HBV infection (i.e., HBsAg negative and anti-HBc positive). HBV reactivation has also been reported in patients receiving certain immunosuppressant or chemotherapeutic agents; the risk of HBV reactivation associated with treatment with HCV direct-acting antivirals may be increased in these patients.  

  HBV reactivation is characterized as an abrupt increase in HBV replication manifesting as a rapid increase in serum HBV DNA level. In patients with resolved HBV infection, reappearance of HBsAg can occur. Reactivation of HBV replication may be accompanied by hepatitis, i.e., increases in aminotransferase levels and, in severe cases, increases in bilirubin levels, liver failure, and death can occur.  

  Test all patients for evidence of current or prior HBV infection by measuring HBsAg and anti-HBc before initiating HCV treatment with SOVALDI. In patients with serologic evidence of HBV infection, monitor for clinical and laboratory signs of hepatitis flare or HBV reactivation during HCV treatment with SOVALDI and during post-treatment follow-up. Initiate appropriate patient management for HBV infection as clinically indicated.  

    5.2 Serious Symptomatic Bradycardia When Coadministered with Amiodarone

   Postmarketing cases of symptomatic bradycardia and cases requiring pacemaker intervention have been reported when amiodarone is coadministered with a sofosbuvir-containing regimen. A fatal cardiac arrest was reported in a patient taking amiodarone who was coadministered a sofosbuvir-containing regimen (HARVONI [ledipasvir/sofosbuvir]). Bradycardia has generally occurred within hours to days, but cases have been observed up to 2 weeks after initiating HCV treatment. Patients also taking beta blockers, or those with underlying cardiac comorbidities and/or advanced liver disease may be at increased risk for symptomatic bradycardia with coadministration of amiodarone. Bradycardia generally resolved after discontinuation of HCV treatment. The mechanism for this effect is unknown.  

  Coadministration of amiodarone with SOVALDI is not recommended. For patients taking amiodarone who have no other alternative, viable treatment options and who will be coadministered SOVALDI:  

 *   Counsel patients about the risk of serious symptomatic bradycardia  
 *   Cardiac monitoring in an in-patient setting for the first 48 hours of coadministration is recommended, after which outpatient or self-monitoring of the heart rate should occur on a daily basis through at least the first 2 weeks of treatment.  
     Patients who are taking SOVALDI who need to start amiodarone therapy due to no other alternative, viable treatment options should undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above.  
 

  Due to amiodarone's long half-life, patients discontinuing amiodarone just prior to starting SOVALDI should also undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above.  

  Patients who develop signs or symptoms of bradycardia should seek medical evaluation immediately. Symptoms may include near-fainting or fainting, dizziness or lightheadedness, malaise, weakness, excessive tiredness, shortness of breath, chest pains, confusion or memory problems [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ,  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ]  .  

    5.3 Risk of Reduced Therapeutic Effect Due to Use with P-gp Inducers

  Drugs that are P-gp inducers in the intestine (e.g., rifampin, St. John's wort) may significantly decrease sofosbuvir plasma concentrations and may lead to a reduced therapeutic effect of SOVALDI. The use of rifampin and St. John's wort with SOVALDI is not recommended [see  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ]  .

    5.4 Risks Associated with Combination Treatment

  Because SOVALDI is used in combination with other antiviral drugs for treatment of HCV infection, consult the prescribing information for these drugs used in combination with SOVALDI. Warnings and Precautions related to these drugs also apply to their use in SOVALDI combination treatment.
