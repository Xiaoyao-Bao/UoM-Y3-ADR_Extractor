  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The safety of VYXEOS was determined in a randomized trial for adults with newly-diagnosed t-AML or AML-MRC  [see Clinical Studies (  14  )]  which included 153 patients treated with VYXEOS and 151 patients treated with a standard combination of cytarabine and daunorubicin (7+3). At study entry, patients were required to have a LVEF of at least 50% and a prior lifetime cumulative anthracycline exposure less than 368 mg/m  2  daunorubicin (or equivalent). On study, the median number of cycles administered was 2 (range, 1-4 cycles) on the VYXEOS arm and 1 (range, 1-4 cycles) on the control arm. The median cumulative daunorubicin dose was 189 mg/m  2  (range, 44-337 mg/m  2  ) on the VYXEOS arm and 186 mg/m  2  (range, 44-532 mg/m  2  ) on the control arm.



 Nine patients each on the VYXEOS arm (6%) and the control arm (6%) had a fatal adverse reaction on treatment or within 30 days of therapy that was not in the setting of progressive disease. Fatal adverse reactions on the VYXEOS arm included infection, CNS hemorrhage, and respiratory failure. Overall, all-cause day-30 mortality was 6% in the VYXEOS arm and 11% in the control arm. During the first 60 days of the study, 14% (21/153) of patients died in the VYXEOS arm vs. 21% (32/151) of patients in the 7+3 treatment group.



 The most common serious adverse reactions (incidence &gt;= 5%) on the VYXEOS arm were dyspnea, myocardial toxicity, sepsis, pneumonia, febrile neutropenia, bacteremia and hemorrhage. Adverse reactions led to discontinuation of VYXEOS in 18% (28/153) of patients, and 13% (20/151) in the control arm. The adverse reactions leading to discontinuation on the VYXEOS arm included prolonged cytopenias, infection, cardiotoxicity, respiratory failure, hemorrhage (GI and CNS), renal insufficiency, colitis, and generalized medical deterioration. The most common adverse reactions (incidence &gt;= 25%) in patients on the VYXEOS arm were hemorrhagic events, febrile neutropenia, rash, edema, nausea, mucositis, diarrhea, constipation, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, abdominal pain, dyspnea, headache, cough, decreased appetite, arrhythmia, pneumonia, bacteremia, chills, sleep disorders, and vomiting. The incidences of common adverse drug reactions during the induction phase in Study 1 are presented in Table 3.

 *       b  Adverse reactions were graded using NCI CTCAE version 3.0. 
    During the consolidation phase (both consolidation cycles pooled) the two most common adverse reactions on the VYXEOS arm are the same as those during induction, hemorrhagic events and febrile neutropenia. These occurred at lower rates in the pooled consolidation phase (43% and 29%, respectively), compared to the induction phase. All of the common adverse reactions (&gt;= 10% incidence in the VYXEOS arm) seen in the pooled consolidation phase were also seen in the induction phase. These occurred at lower incidence in the consolidation phase, with the exception of chills, dizziness and pyrexia, where the incidences were relatively similar across the induction and consolidation cycles.
 

 Other notable adverse drug reactions that occurred in less than 10% of patients treated with VYXEOS during induction or consolidation included:



 *    Ear and labyrinth disorders: Deafness, Deafness unilateral 
 *    Eye Disorders: Eye conjunctivitis, Dry eye, Eye edema, Eye swelling, Eye irritation, Eye pain, Ocular discomfort, Ocular hyperemia, Periorbital edema, Scleral hyperemia 
 *    Gastrointestinal disorders: Dyspepsia 
 *    Psychiatric disorders: Hallucinations

   5.1 Do Not Interchange With Other Daunorubicin And/Or Cytarabine-Containing Products



  Due to substantial differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters, the dose and schedule recommendations for VYXEOS are different from those for daunorubicin hydrochloride injection, cytarabine injection, daunorubicin citrate liposome injection, and cytarabine liposome injection. Verify drug name and dose prior to preparation and administration to avoid dosing errors. Do not substitute other preparations of daunorubicin or cytarabine for VYXEOS.



    5.2 Hemorrhage



  Serious or fatal hemorrhage events, including fatal central nervous system (CNS) hemorrhages, associated with prolonged severe thrombocytopenia, have occurred in patients treated with VYXEOS. In Study 1 (NCT01696084), the incidence of any grade hemorrhagic events during the entire treatment period was 74% of patients on the VYXEOS arm and 56% on the control arm. The most frequently reported hemorrhagic event was epistaxis (36% in VYXEOS arm and 18% in control arm). Grade 3 or greater events occurred in 12% of VYXEOS treated patients and 8% of patients treated with 7+3. Fatal treatment-emergent CNS hemorrhage not in the setting of progressive disease occurred in 2% of patients on the VYXEOS arm and in 0.7% of patients on the control arm. Monitor blood counts regularly until recovery and administer platelet transfusion support as required [ see Adverse Reactions  (   6.1    )].



    5.3 Cardiotoxicity



  VYXEOS contains the anthracycline daunorubicin, which has a known risk of cardiotoxicity. Prior therapy with anthracyclines, pre-existing cardiac disease, previous radiotherapy to the mediastinum, or concomitant use of cardiotoxic drugs may increase the risk of daunorubicin-induced cardiac toxicity. Prior to administering VYXEOS, obtain an electrocardiogram (ECG) and assess cardiac function by multi-gated radionuclide angiography (MUGA) scan or echocardiography (ECHO). Repeat MUGA or ECHO determinations of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) prior to consolidation with VYXEOS and as clinically required. Discontinue VYXEOS in patients with impaired cardiac function unless the benefit of initiating or continuing treatment outweighs the risk. VYXEOS treatment is not recommended in patients with LVEF that is less than normal.



 Total cumulative doses of non-liposomal daunorubicin greater than 550 mg/m  2  have been associated with an increased incidence of drug-induced congestive heart failure. The tolerable limit appears lower (400 mg/m  2  ) in patients who received radiation therapy to the mediastinum.



 Calculate the lifetime cumulative anthracycline exposure prior to each cycle of VYXEOS. VYXEOS treatment is not recommended in patients whose lifetime anthracycline exposure has reached the maximum cumulative limit. The exposure to daunorubicin following each cycle of VYXEOS is shown in Table 2.



 Table 2: Cumulative Exposure of Daunorubicin per Cycle of VYXEOS 
  Therapy                    Daunorubicin per Dose      Number of Doses per Cycle    Daunorubicin per Cycle     
  First Induction Cycle      44 mg/m2                   3                          132 mg/m2                  
  Second Induction Cycle     44 mg/m2                   2                          88 mg/m2                   
  Each Consolidation Cycle    29 mg/m2                   2                          58 mg/m2                   
             5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions
 

  Serious or fatal hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have been reported with daunorubicin and cytarabine. Monitor patients for hypersensitivity reactions. If a mild or moderate hypersensitivity reaction occurs, interrupt or slow the rate of infusion with VYXEOS and manage symptoms. If a severe or life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue VYXEOS permanently, treat symptoms according to the standard of care, and monitor until symptoms resolve [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  )]  .



    5.5 Copper Overload



  Reconstituted VYXEOS contains 5 mg/mL copper gluconate, of which 14% is elemental copper. There is no clinical experience with VYXEOS in patients with Wilson's disease or other copper-related metabolic disorders. The maximum theoretical total exposure of copper under the recommended VYXEOS dosing regimen is 106 mg/m  2   [see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  )]  . Consult with a hepatologist and nephrologist with expertise in managing acute copper toxicity in patients with Wilson's disease treated with VYXEOS. Monitor total serum copper, serum non-ceruloplasmin bound copper, 24-hour urine copper levels and serial neuropsychological examinations in these patients. Use VYXEOS in patients with Wilson's disease only if the benefits outweigh the risks. Discontinue VYXEOS in patients with signs or symptoms of acute copper toxicity.



    5.6 Tissue Necrosis



  Daunorubicin has been associated with severe local tissue necrosis at the site of drug extravasation. Administer VYXEOS by the intravenous route only. Do not administer by intramuscular or subcutaneous route.



    5.7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies with daunorubicin and cytarabine, VYXEOS can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of VYXEOS, daunorubicin, or cytarabine in pregnant women. Daunorubicin and cytarabine are reproductive and developmental toxicants in multiple species (mice, rats, and/or dogs), starting at a dose that was approximately 0.02 times the exposure in patients at the recommended human dose on an mg/m  2  basis. Patients should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while taking VYXEOS. If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, apprise the patient of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females and males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months following the last dose of VYXEOS [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  ) and (  8.3  )]  .
