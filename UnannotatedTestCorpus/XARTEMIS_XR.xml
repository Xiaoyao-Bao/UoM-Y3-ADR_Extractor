  6.1       Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 In safety data from two Phase 3 (one placebo-controlled, one open-label) trials where multiple doses of XARTEMIS XR were administered for up to 42 days, the most common adverse reactions (reported by &gt;=10% in any XARTEMIS XR dose group) were: nausea, dizziness and vomiting. The most common reasons for discontinuation due to AEs in these 2 studies (reported by &gt;=1% in any XARTEMIS XR dose group) were vomiting (4.8%) and nausea (4.1%); there were no reports of these adverse reactions in the placebo-treated patients.



 A total of 1028 subjects in 14 clinical studies were treated with XARTEMIS XR during the clinical development program, including 892 subjects treated with 15 mg oxycodone and 650 mg acetaminophen. This dosage regimen of XARTEMIS XR was administered to 607 patients in two Phase 3 studies (one placebo-controlled and one open-label).



 In a placebo-controlled post-bunionectomy acute pain trial, 329 patients were dosed with 15 mg oxycodone and 650 mg acetaminophen XARTEMIS XR or placebo orally every 12 hours, for approximately 48 hours (blinded period)  [see Clinical Studies (  14  )]  .  Table 1  lists the adverse reactions reported by &gt;=1% of XARTEMIS XR-treated patients and more frequently in XARTEMIS XR-treated patients compared with placebo.

   6.2       Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of XARTEMIS XR. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Serotonin syndrome  : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs  [see Drug Interactions (  7  )]  .



   Adrenal insufficiency  : Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.8  )]  .



   Anaphylaxis  : Anaphylactic reaction has been reported with ingredients contained in XARTEMIS XR  [see Contraindications (  4  )]  .

    BOXED WARNING: 

  

      WARNING: ADDICTION, ABUSE, AND MISUSE; LIFE-THREATENING RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION; ACCIDENTAL INGESTION; NEONATAL OPIOID WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME; CYTOCHROME P450 3A4 INTERACTION; HEPATOTOXICITY; and RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH BENZODIAZEPINES OR OTHER CNS DEPRESSANTS    



       Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse  XARTEMIS XR exposes patients and other users to the risks of opioid addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess each patient's risk prior to prescribing XARTEMIS XR, and monitor all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors and conditions   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )].      



       Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression  Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of XARTEMIS XR. Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of XARTEMIS XR or following a dose increase. Instruct patients to swallow XARTEMIS XR tablets whole; crushing, chewing, or dissolving XARTEMIS XR can cause rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )].      



       Accidental Ingestion  Accidental ingestion of XARTEMIS XR, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of oxycodone   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )].      



       Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome  Prolonged use of XARTEMIS XR during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  )].      



       Cytochrome P450 3A4 Interaction   The concomitant use of XARTEMIS XR with all cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may result in an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse reactions and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. In addition, discontinuation of a concomitantly used cytochrome P450 3A4 inducer may result in an increase in oxycodone plasma concentration. Monitor patients receiving XARTEMIS XR and any CYP3A4 inhibitor or   inducer     [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.4  ), Drug Interactions (  7  ), Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )].       



       Hepatotoxicity  XARTEMIS XR contains acetaminophen. Acetaminophen has been associated with cases of acute liver failure, at times resulting in liver transplant and death. Most of the cases of liver injury are associated with the use of acetaminophen at doses that exceed 4,000 milligrams per day, and often involve more than one acetaminophen-containing product   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.5  ,   5.12  )].      



     Risks From Concomitant Use With Benzodiazepines Or Other CNS Depressants Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.6  ), Drug Interactions (  7  )].      



 *  Reserve concomitant prescribing of XARTEMIS XR and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. 
 *  Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. 
 *  Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.

   5.1       Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse



  XARTEMIS XR contains oxycodone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, XARTEMIS XR exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (  9  )]  .



 Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed XARTEMIS XR. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused.



 Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing XARTEMIS XR, and monitor all patients receiving XARTEMIS XR for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol addiction or abuse) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as XARTEMIS XR, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of XARTEMIS XR along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse.



 Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing XARTEMIS XR. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity [see Patient Counseling Information (  17  )]  . Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.



 Abuse or misuse of XARTEMIS XR by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product will result in the uncontrolled delivery of the oxycodone and can result in overdose and death [see Overdosage (  10  )]  .



    5.2       Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression



  Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression from opioid use, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see Overdosage (  10  )]  . Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.



 While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of XARTEMIS XR, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially during the first 24 to 72 hours of initiating therapy with XARTEMIS XR and following dose increases.



 To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of XARTEMIS XR are essential [see Dosage and Administration (  2  )]  . Overestimating the XARTEMIS XR dose when converting patients from another opioid product can result in fatal overdose with the first dose.



 Accidental ingestion of XARTEMIS XR, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of oxycodone.



    5.3       Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome



  Prolonged use of XARTEMIS XR during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  ), Patient Counseling Information (  17  )].



    5.4      Risks of Concomitant Use or Discontinuation of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers



   Concomitant use of XARTEMIS XR with a CYP3A4 inhibitor, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may increase plasma concentrations of oxycodone and prolong opioid adverse reactions, which may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )]  , particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of XARTEMIS XR is achieved. Similarly, discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inducer, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, in XARTEMIS XR-treated patients may increase oxycodone plasma concentrations and prolong adverse reactions. When using XARTEMIS XR with CYP3A4 inhibitors or discontinuing CYP3A4 inducers in XARTEMIS XR-treated patients, monitor patients closely at frequent intervals and consider dosage reduction of XARTEMIS XR until stable drug effects are achieved [see Dosage and Administration (  2  ), Drug Interactions (  7  )]  .  



  Concomitant use of XARTEMIS XR with CYP3A4 inducers or discontinuation of an CYP3A4 inhibitor could decrease oxycodone plasma concentrations, decrease opioid efficacy or, possibly, lead to a withdrawal syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. When using XARTEMIS XR with CYP3A4 inducers or discontinuing CYP3A4 inhibitors, monitor patients closely at frequent intervals and consider increasing the opioid dosage if needed to maintain adequate analgesia or if symptoms of opioid withdrawal occur [see Drug Interactions (  7  )]  .  



    5.5       Hepatotoxicity



   XARTEMIS XR contains oxycodone and acetaminophen. Acetaminophen has been associated with cases of acute liver failure, at times resulting in liver transplant and death. Most of the cases of liver injury are associated with the use of acetaminophen at doses that exceed 4,000 milligrams per day, and often involve more than one acetaminophen-containing product. The excessive intake of acetaminophen may be intentional to cause self-harm or unintentional as patients attempt to obtain more pain relief or unknowingly take other acetaminophen-containing products. The typical daily acetaminophen contribution from XARTEMIS XR is 1,300 mg.  



  The risk of acute liver failure is higher in individuals with underlying liver disease and in individuals who ingest alcohol while taking acetaminophen.  



  Instruct patients to look for acetaminophen or APAP on package labels and not to use more than one product that contains acetaminophen. Instruct patients to seek medical attention immediately upon ingestion of more than 4,000 milligrams of acetaminophen per day, even if they feel well.  



    5.6       Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants



   Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of XARTEMIS XR with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.  



  Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions (  7  )]  .  



  If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.  



  Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when XARTEMIS XR is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [see Drug Interactions (  7  ) and Patient Counseling Information (  17  )]  .  



    5.7        Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients



  The use of XARTEMIS XR in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated.



  Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease  : XARTEMIS XR-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of XARTEMIS XR [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )]  .



  Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients  : Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )]  .



 Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating XARTEMIS XR and when XARTEMIS XR is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )]  . Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients.



    5.8       Adrenal Insufficiency



   Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.  



    5.9       Severe Hypotension



  XARTEMIS XR may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (  7  )]  . Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or triturating the dosage of XARTEMIS XR. In patients with circulatory shock, XARTEMIS XR may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of XARTEMIS XR in patients with circulatory shock.



    5.10       Serious Skin Reactions



  Rarely, acetaminophen may cause serious skin reactions such as acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. Inform patients about the signs of serious skin reactions, and discontinue use at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity.



    5.11    Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness



  In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), XARTEMIS XR may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with XARTEMIS XR.



 Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of XARTEMIS XR in patients with impaired consciousness or coma.



    5.12     Hypersensitivity/Anaphylaxis



  There have been post-marketing reports of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis associated with use of acetaminophen. Clinical signs included swelling of the face, mouth, and throat, respiratory distress, urticaria, rash, pruritus, and vomiting. There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergency medical attention. Instruct patients to discontinue XARTEMIS XR immediately and seek medical care if they experience these symptoms. Do not prescribe XARTEMIS XR for patients with acetaminophen allergy.



    5.13    Difficulty Swallowing



  Due to characteristics of the formulation that cause the tablets to swell and become sticky when wet, consider use of an alternative analgesic in patients who have difficulty swallowing and patients at risk for underlying GI disorders resulting in a small gastrointestinal lumen. Instruct patients not to pre-soak, lick or otherwise wet XARTEMIS XR tablets prior to placing in the mouth, and to take one tablet at a time with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in mouth.



    5.14    Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions



  XARTEMIS XR is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus.



 The oxycodone in XARTEMIS XR may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms.



    5.15    Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorder



  The oxycodone in XARTEMIS XR may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during XARTEMIS XR therapy.



    5.16    Withdrawal



  Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including XARTEMIS XR. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms [see Drug Interactions (  7  )]  .



 When discontinuing XARTEMIS XR, gradually taper the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2)]  . Do not abruptly discontinue XARTEMIS XR [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (  9.3  )]  .



    5.17    Driving and Operating Machinery



  XARTEMIS XR may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery.



 Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of XARTEMIS XR and know how they will react to the medication [see Patient Counseling Information (  17  )]  .
