  6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



   METEOR  



 The safety of CABOMETYX was evaluated in METEOR, a randomized, open-label trial in which 331 patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma received 60 mg CABOMETYX and 322 patients received 10 mg everolimus administered daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients on both arms who had disease progression could continue treatment at the discretion of the investigator  [see  Clinical Studies (14)  ]  . The median duration of treatment was 7.6 months (range 0.3 - 20.5) for patients receiving CABOMETYX and 4.4 months (range 0.21 - 18.9) for patients receiving everolimus.



 Adverse reactions which occurred in &gt;= 25% of CABOMETYX-treated patients included, in order of decreasing frequency: diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, decreased appetite, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE), hypertension, vomiting, weight decreased, and constipation. Grade 3-4 adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities which occurred in &gt;= 5% of patients were hypertension, diarrhea, fatigue, PPE, hyponatremia, hypophosphatemia, hypomagnesemia, lymphocytes decreased, anemia, hypokalemia, and GGT increased.



 The dose was reduced in 60% of patients receiving CABOMETYX and in 24% of patients receiving everolimus. Twenty percent (20%) of patients received 20 mg CABOMETYX as their lowest dose. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to dose reduction in patients treated with CABOMETYX were: diarrhea, PPE, fatigue, and hypertension. Adverse reactions led to study treatment being held in 70% patients receiving CABOMETYX and in 59% patients receiving everolimus. Adverse reactions led to study treatment discontinuation in 10% of patients receiving CABOMETYX and in 10% of patients receiving everolimus. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in patients treated with CABOMETYX were decreased appetite (2%) and fatigue (1%).

             CABOSUN  
 

 The safety of CABOMETYX was evaluated in CABOSUN, a randomized, open-label trial in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma, in which 78 patients received 60 mg CABOMETYX daily and 72 patients received 50 mg sunitinib taken once daily (4 weeks on treatment followed by 2 weeks off), until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity  [see  Clinical Studies (14)  ]  . The median duration of treatment was 6.5 months (range 0.2 - 28.7) for patients receiving CABOMETYX and 3.1 months (range 0.2 - 25.5) for patients receiving sunitinib.



 Within 30 days of treatment, there were 4 deaths in patients treated with CABOMETYX and 6 deaths in patients treated with sunitinib. Of the 4 patients treated with CABOMETYX, two patients died due to gastrointestinal perforation, one patient had acute renal failure, and one patient died due to clinical deterioration. All Grade 3-4 adverse reactions were collected in the entire safety population. The most frequent Grade 3-4 adverse reactions (&gt;=5%) in patients treated with CABOMETYX were hypertension, diarrhea, hyponatremia, hypophosphatemia, PPE, fatigue, ALT increased, decreased appetite, stomatitis, pain, hypotension, and syncope.



 The median average daily dose was 50.3 mg for CABOMETYX and 44.7 mg for sunitinib (excluding scheduled sunitinib non-dosing days). The dose was reduced in 46% of patients receiving CABOMETYX and in 35% of patients receiving sunitinib. The dose was held in 73% of patients receiving CABOMETYX and in 71% of patients receiving sunitinib. Based on patient disposition, 21% of patients receiving CABOMETYX and 22% of patients receiving sunitinib discontinued due to an adverse reaction.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Hemorrhage: Do not administer CABOMETYX if recent history of severe hemorrhage. (  5.1  ) 
 *  GI Perforations and Fistulas: Monitor for symptoms. Discontinue CABOMETYX for fistulas that cannot be adequately managed or perforations. (  5.2  ) 
 *  Thrombotic Events: Discontinue CABOMETYX for myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction, or other serious arterial thromboembolic events. (  5.3  ) 
 *  Hypertension and Hypertensive Crisis: Monitor blood pressure regularly. Discontinue CABOMETYX for hypertensive crisis or severe hypertension that cannot be controlled with anti-hypertensive therapy. (  5.4  ) 
 *  Diarrhea: May be severe. Interrupt CABOMETYX treatment immediately until diarrhea resolves or decreases to Grade 1. Recommend standard antidiarrheal treatments. (  5.5  ) 
 *  Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE): Interrupt CABOMETYX treatment until PPE resolves or decreases to Grade 1. (  5.6  ) 
 *  Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS): Discontinue CABOMETYX. (  5.7  ) 
 *  Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. (  5.8  ,  8.1  ,  8.3  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Hemorrhage



   Severe and fatal hemorrhages have occurred with CABOMETYX. In two RCC studies, the incidence of Grade &gt;= 3 hemorrhagic events was 3% in CABOMETYX-treated patients.  



 Do not administer CABOMETYX to patients that have or are at risk for severe hemorrhage [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  .



    5.2 GI Perforations and Fistulas



  In RCC studies, fistulas were reported in 1% of CABOMETYX-treated patients. Fatal perforations occurred in patients treated with CABOMETYX. In RCC studies, gastrointestinal (GI) perforations were reported in 1% of CABOMETYX-treated patients.



 Monitor patients for symptoms of fistulas and perforations, including abscess and sepsis. Discontinue CABOMETYX in patients who experience a fistula which cannot be appropriately managed or a GI perforation.



    5.3 Thrombotic Events



  CABOMETYX treatment results in an increased incidence of thrombotic events. In RCC studies, venous thromboembolism occurred in 9% (including 5% pulmonary embolism) and arterial thromboembolism occurred in 1% of CABOMETYX-treated patients. Fatal thrombotic events occurred in the cabozantinib clinical program.



 Discontinue CABOMETYX in patients who develop an acute myocardial infarction or any other arterial thromboembolic complication.



    5.4 Hypertension and Hypertensive Crisis



  CABOMETYX treatment results in an increased incidence of treatment-emergent hypertension, including hypertensive crisis. In RCC studies, hypertension was reported in 44% (18% Grade &gt;= 3) of CABOMETYX-treated patients. Monitor blood pressure prior to initiation and regularly during CABOMETYX treatment. Withhold CABOMETYX for hypertension that is not adequately controlled with medical management; when controlled, resume CABOMETYX at a reduced dose. Discontinue CABOMETYX for severe hypertension that cannot be controlled with anti-hypertensive therapy. Discontinue CABOMETYX if there is evidence of hypertensive crisis or severe hypertension despite optimal medical management.



    5.5 Diarrhea



  In RCC studies, diarrhea occurred in 74% of patients treated with CABOMETYX. Grade 3 diarrhea occurred in 11% of patients treated with CABOMETYX. Withhold CABOMETYX in patients who develop intolerable Grade 2 diarrhea or Grade 3-4 diarrhea that cannot be managed with standard antidiarrheal treatments until improvement to Grade 1; resume CABOMETYX at a reduced dose.



    5.6 Palmar-Plantar Erythrodysesthesia



  In RCC studies, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE) occurred in 42% of patients treated with CABOMETYX. Grade 3 PPE occurred in 8% of patients treated with CABOMETYX. Withhold CABOMETYX in patients who develop intolerable Grade 2 PPE or Grade 3 PPE until improvement to Grade 1; resume CABOMETYX at a reduced dose.



    5.7 Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome



  Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS), a syndrome of subcortical vasogenic edema diagnosed by characteristic finding on MRI, occurred in the cabozantinib clinical program. Perform an evaluation for RPLS in any patient presenting with seizures, headache, visual disturbances, confusion or altered mental function. Discontinue CABOMETYX in patients who develop RPLS.



    5.8 Embryo-fetal Toxicity



  Based on data from animal studies and its mechanism of action, CABOMETYX can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Cabozantinib administration to pregnant animals during organogenesis resulted in embryolethality at exposures below those occurring clinically at the recommended dose, and in increased incidences of skeletal variations in rats and visceral variations and malformations in rabbits. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with CABOMETYX and for 4 months after the last dose [See  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ,  (8.3)  , and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)  ].
