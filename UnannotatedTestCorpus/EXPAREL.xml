  6.1 Clinical Trials

    Adverse Reactions Reported in All Local Infiltration Clinical Studies  



 Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The safety of EXPAREL was evaluated in 10 randomized, double-blind, local administration into the surgical site clinical studies involving 823 patients undergoing various surgical procedures. Patients were administered a dose ranging from 66 to 532 mg of EXPAREL. In these studies, the most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 10%) following EXPAREL administration were nausea, constipation, and vomiting.



 The common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 2% to less than 10%) following EXPAREL administration were pyrexia, dizziness, edema peripheral, anemia, hypotension, pruritus, tachycardia, headache, insomnia, anemia postoperative, muscle spasms, hemorrhagic anemia, back pain, somnolence, and procedural pain.



 The less common/rare adverse reactions (incidence less than 2%) following EXPAREL administration were chills, erythema, bradycardia, anxiety, urinary retention, pain, edema, tremor, dizziness postural, paresthesia, syncope, incision site edema, procedural hypertension, procedural hypotension, procedural nausea, muscular weakness, neck pain, pruritus generalized, rash pruritic, hyperhidrosis, cold sweat, urticaria, palpitations, sinus bradycardia, supraventricular extrasystoles, ventricular extrasystoles, ventricular tachycardia, hypertension, pallor, anxiety, confusional state, depression, agitation, restlessness, hypoxia, laryngospasm, apnea, respiratory depression, respiratory failure, body temperature increased, blood pressure increased, blood pressure decreased, oxygen saturation decreased, urinary incontinence, vision blurred, tinnitus, drug hypersensitivity, and hypersensitivity.



   Neurological and Cardiac Adverse Reactions  



 In the EXPAREL surgical site infiltration studies, adverse reactions with an incidence greater than or equal to 1% in the Nervous System Disorders system organ class following EXPAREL administration were dizziness (6.2%), headache (3.8%), somnolence (2.1%), hypoesthesia (1.5%), and lethargy (1.3%). The adverse reactions with an incidence greater than or equal to 1% in the Cardiac Disorders system organ class following EXPAREL administration were tachycardia (3.9%) and bradycardia (1.6%).



   Adverse Reactions Reported in All Local Infiltration Placebo-Controlled Trials  



 Adverse reactions with an incidence greater than or equal to 2% reported by patients in clinical studies comparing 8 mL EXPAREL 1.3% (106 mg) to placebo and 20 mL EXPAREL 1.3% (266 mg) to placebo are shown in  Table 1  .

             Adverse Reactions Reported in All Nerve Block Clinical Studies  
 

 The safety of EXPAREL was evaluated in four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled nerve block clinical studies involving 469 patients undergoing various surgical procedures. Patients were administered a dose of either 133 or 266 mg of EXPAREL. In these studies, the most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 10%) following EXPAREL administration were nausea, pyrexia, and constipation.



 The common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 2% to less than 10%) following EXPAREL administration as a nerve block were muscle twitching, dysgeusia, urinary retention, fatigue, headache, confusional state, hypotension, hypertension, hypoesthesia oral, pruritus generalized, hyperhidrosis, tachycardia, sinus tachycardia, anxiety, fall, body temperature increased, edema peripheral, sensory loss, hepatic enzyme increased, hiccups, hypoxia, and post-procedural hematoma.



 The less common/rare adverse reactions (incidence less than 2%) following EXPAREL administration as a nerve block were arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, atrioventricular block first degree, bradycardia, bundle branch block left, bundle branch block right, cardiac arrest, hearing impaired, vision blurred, visual impairment, asthenia, chills, hyperthermia, cellulitis, lung infection, pneumonia, procedural nausea, wound dehiscence, wound secretion, electrocardiogram QT prolonged, white blood cell count increased, arthralgia, back pain, joint swelling, mobility decreased, muscle spasms, muscular weakness, musculoskeletal pain, paraesthesia, presyncope, sedation, somnolence, syncope, delirium, dysuria, urinary incontinence, atelectasis, cough, dyspnea, lung infiltration, blister, drug eruption, erythema, rash, urticaria, deep vein thrombosis, hematoma, and orthostatic hypotension.



 Adverse reactions with an incidence greater than or equal to 2% reported by patients in clinical studies comparing 10 mL EXPAREL 1.3% (133 mg) and 20 mL EXPAREL 1.3% (266 mg) to placebo are shown in  Table 2  .



   Neurological and Cardiac Adverse Reactions  



 In the EXPAREL nerve block studies, adverse reactions with an incidence greater than or equal to 1% in the Nervous System Disorders system organ class following EXPAREL administration were motor dysfunction (14.9%), dysgeusia (7.2%), headache (5.1%), hypoesthesia (2.3%), and sensory loss (2.3%). The adverse reactions with an incidence greater than or equal to 1% in the Cardiac Disorders system organ class following EXPAREL administration were tachycardia (3.0%), sinus tachycardia (2.3%), and bradycardia (1.3%).

            6.2 Postmarketing Experience
   Because adverse reactions reported during postmarketing are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 These adverse reactions are consistent with those observed in clinical studies and most commonly involve the following system organ classes (SOCs): Injury, Poisoning, and Procedural Complications (e.g., drug-drug interaction, procedural pain), Nervous System Disorders (e.g., palsy, seizure), General Disorders And Administration Site Conditions (e.g., lack of efficacy, pain), Skin And Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders (e.g., erythema, rash), and Cardiac Disorders (e.g., bradycardia, cardiac arrest).

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Monitor cardiovascular status, neurological status, and vital signs during and after injection of EXPAREL (  5.1  ). 
 *  Because amide-type local anesthetics, such as bupivacaine, are metabolized by the liver, use EXPAREL cautiously in patients with hepatic disease. Patients with severe hepatic disease, because of their inability to metabolize local anesthetics normally, are at a greater risk of developing toxic plasma concentrations (  5.1  ). 
 *   Methemoglobinemia : Cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported in association with local anesthetic use (  5.1  ). 
 *  Avoid additional use of local anesthetics within 96 hours following administration of EXPAREL (  5.2  ). 
    
 

   5.1 Warnings and Precautions for Bupivacaine Containing Products



  The safety and effectiveness of bupivacaine and other amide-containing products depend on proper dosage, correct technique, adequate precautions, and readiness for emergencies. As there is a potential risk of severe life-threatening adverse effects associated with the administration of bupivacaine, any bupivacaine-containing product should be administered in a setting where trained personnel and equipment are available to promptly treat patients who show evidence of neurological or cardiac toxicity [ See Overdosage (  10  )  ].



 Careful and constant monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory (adequacy of ventilation) vital signs and the patient's state of consciousness should be performed after injection of bupivacaine and other amide-containing products. Restlessness, anxiety, incoherent speech, lightheadedness, numbness and tingling of the mouth and lips, metallic taste, tinnitus, dizziness, blurred vision, tremors, twitching, depression, or drowsiness may be early warning signs of central nervous system toxicity.



 Bupivacaine and other amide-containing products should also be used with caution in patients with impaired cardiovascular function because they may be less able to compensate for functional changes associated with the prolongation of AV conduction produced by these drugs.



 Injection of multiple doses of bupivacaine and other amide-containing products may cause significant increases in plasma concentrations with each repeated dose due to slow accumulation of the drug or its metabolites, or to slow metabolic degradation. Tolerance to elevated blood concentrations varies with the status of the patient.



 Because amide-type local anesthetics, such as bupivacaine, are metabolized by the liver, these drugs should be used cautiously in patients with hepatic disease. Patients with severe hepatic disease, because of their inability to metabolize local anesthetics normally, are at a greater risk of developing toxic plasma concentrations.



  Central Nervous System Reactions  



 The incidences of adverse neurologic reactions associated with the use of local anesthetics may be related to the total dose of local anesthetic administered and are also dependent upon the particular drug used, the route of administration, and the physical status of the patient. Many of these effects may be related to local anesthetic techniques, with or without a contribution from the drug. Neurologic effects following infiltration of soft tissue may include persistent anesthesia, paresthesia, weakness, and paralysis, all of which may have slow, incomplete, or no recovery.



 Central nervous system reactions are characterized by excitation and/or depression. Restlessness, anxiety, dizziness, tinnitus, blurred vision, or tremors may occur, possibly proceeding to convulsions. However, excitement may be transient or absent, with depression being the first manifestation of an adverse reaction. This may quickly be followed by drowsiness merging into unconsciousness and respiratory arrest. Other central nervous system effects may be nausea, vomiting, chills, and constriction of the pupils. The incidence of convulsions associated with the use of local anesthetics varies with the procedure used and the total dose administered.



  Cardiovascular System Reactions  



 Toxic blood concentrations depress cardiac conductivity and excitability, which may lead to atrioventricular block, ventricular arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest, sometimes resulting in fatalities. In addition, myocardial contractility is depressed and peripheral vasodilation occurs, leading to decreased cardiac output and arterial blood pressure [ See Overdosage (  10  )  ].



  Allergic Reactions  



 Allergic-type reactions are rare and may occur as a result of hypersensitivity to the local anesthetic or to other formulation ingredients. These reactions are characterized by signs such as urticaria, pruritus, erythema, angioneurotic edema (including laryngeal edema), tachycardia, sneezing, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, syncope, excessive sweating, elevated temperature, and possibly anaphylactoid-like symptoms (including severe hypotension). Cross-sensitivity among members of the amide-type local anesthetic group has been reported. The usefulness of screening for sensitivity has not been definitively established.



  Chondrolysis  



 Intra-articular infusions of local anesthetics following arthroscopic and other surgical procedures is an unapproved use, and there have been postmarketing reports of chondrolysis in patients receiving such infusions. The majority of reported cases of chondrolysis have involved the shoulder joint; cases of gleno-humeral chondrolysis have been described in pediatric patients and adult patients following intra-articular infusions of local anesthetics with and without epinephrine for periods of 48 to 72 hours. There is insufficient information to determine whether shorter infusion periods are not associated with these findings. The time of onset of symptoms, such as joint pain, stiffness, and loss of motion can be variable, but may begin as early as the second month after surgery. Currently, there is no effective treatment for chondrolysis; patients who have experienced chondrolysis have required additional diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and some required arthroplasty or shoulder replacement.



   Methemoglobinemia    



  Cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported in association with local anesthetic use. Although all patients are at risk for methemoglobinemia, patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia, cardiac or pulmonary compromise, infants under 6 months of age, and concurrent exposure to oxidizing agents or their metabolites are more susceptible to developing clinical manifestations of the condition. If local anesthetics must be used in these patients, close monitoring for symptoms and signs of methemoglobinemia is recommended.  



  Signs of methemoglobinemia may occur immediately or may be delayed some hours after exposure, and are characterized by a cyanotic skin discoloration and/or abnormal coloration of the blood. Methemoglobin levels may continue to rise; therefore, immediate treatment is required to avert more serious central nervous system and cardiovascular adverse effects, including seizures, coma, arrhythmias, and death. Discontinue EXPAREL and any oxidizing agents. Depending on the severity of the signs and symptoms, patients may respond to supportive care, i.e., oxygen therapy, hydration. A more severe clinical presentation may require treatment with methylene blue, exchange transfusion, or hyperbaric oxygen.  



    5.2 Warnings and Precautions Specific for EXPAREL



   As there is a potential risk of severe life-threatening adverse effects associated with the administration of bupivacaine, EXPAREL should be administered in a setting where trained personnel and equipment are available to promptly treat patients who show evidence of neurological or cardiac toxicity [ See Overdosage (  10  )    ].



  Caution should be taken to avoid accidental intravascular injection of EXPAREL. Convulsions and cardiac arrest have occurred following accidental intravascular injection of bupivacaine and other amide-containing products.  



  Avoid additional use of local anesthetics within 96 hours following administration of EXPAREL [ See Dosage and Administration (  2.4  ) and Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )    ].



 EXPAREL has not been evaluated for the following uses and, therefore, is not recommended for these types of analgesia or routes of administration.



 *  epidural 
 *  intrathecal 
 *   regional nerve blocks other than interscalene brachial plexus nerve block  
 *  intravascular or intra-articular use 
    EXPAREL has not been evaluated for use in the following patient populations and, therefore, is not recommended for administration to these groups.
 

 *  patients younger than 18 years old 
 *  pregnant patients 
     The potential sensory and/or motor loss with EXPAREL is temporary and varies in degree and duration depending on the site of injection and dosage administered and may last for up to 5 days as seen in clinical trials.
