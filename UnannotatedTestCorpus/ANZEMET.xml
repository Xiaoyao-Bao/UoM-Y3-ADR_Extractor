   General



   Dolasetron should be administered with caution in patients who have or may develop prolongation of cardiac conduction intervals, particularly QTc. These include patients with hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, patients taking diuretics with potential for inducing electrolyte abnormalities, patients with congenital QT syndrome, patients taking anti-arrhythmic drugs or other drugs which lead to QT prolongation, and cumulative high dose anthracycline therapy.  



 Cross hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients who received other selective 5-HT3receptor antagonists. These reactions have not been seen with dolasetron mesylate.



    Drug Interactions



  The potential for clinically significant drug-drug interactions posed by dolasetron and hydrodolasetron appears to be low for drugs commonly used in chemotherapy because hydrodolasetron is eliminated by multiple routes. See  PRECAUTIONS, General  for information about potential interaction with other drugs that prolong the QTcinterval.



 When oral dolasetron (200 mg once daily) was coadministered with cimetidine (300 mg four times daily) for 7 days, the systemic exposure (i.e., AUC) of hydrodolasetron increased by 24% and the maximum plasma concentration of hydrodolasetron increased by 15%. When oral dolasetron (200 mg once daily) was coadministered with rifampin (600 mg once daily) for 7 days, the systemic exposure of hydrodolasetron decreased by 28% and the maximum plasma concentration of hydrodolasetron decreased by 17%.



 Caution should be exercised when ANZEMET is coadministered with drugs, including those used in chemotherapy, that prolong ECG intervals and/or cause hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia. (see  WARNINGS  ).



 In patients taking furosemide, nifedipine, diltiazem, ACE inhibitors, verapamil, glyburide, propranolol, and various chemotherapy agents, no effect was shown on the clearance of hydrodolasetron. Clearance of hydrodolasetron decreased by about 27% when dolasetron mesylate was administered intravenously concomitantly with atenolol. Dolasetron mesylate did not inhibit the antitumor activity of four chemotherapeutic agents (cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide) in four murine models.



 Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular abnormalities) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs).



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility



  In a 24-month carcinogenicity study, there was a statistically significant (P&lt;0.001) increase in the incidence of combined hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas in male mice treated with 150 mg/kg/day and above. In this study, mice (CD-1) were treated orally with dolasetron mesylate 75, 150, or 300 mg/kg/day (225, 450 or 900 mg/m  2  /day). For a 50 kg person of average height (1.46 m  2  body surface area), these doses represent 3, 6, and 12 times the recommended clinical dose (74 mg/m  2  ) on a body surface area basis. No increase in liver tumors was observed at a dose of 75 mg/kg/day in male mice and at doses up to 300 mg/kg/day in female mice.



 In a 24-month rat (Sprague-Dawley) carcinogenicity study, oral dolasetron mesylate was not tumorigenic at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day (900 mg/m  2  /day, 12 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) in male rats and 300 mg/kg/day (1800 mg/m  2  /day, 24 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) in female rats.



 Dolasetron mesylate was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the rat lymphocyte chromosomal aberration test, the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell (HGPRT) forward mutation test, the rat hepatocyte unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) test or the mouse micronucleus test.



 Dolasetron mesylate was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance at oral doses up to 100 mg/kg/day (600 mg/m  2  /day, 8 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) in female rats and up to 400 mg/kg/day (2400 mg/m  2  /day, 32 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) in male rats.



    Pregnancy



   Teratogenic Effects



   Pregnancy Category B  



 Teratology studies have not revealed evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to dolasetron mesylate. These studies have been performed in pregnant rats at oral doses up to 100 mg/kg/day (8 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at oral doses up to 100 mg/kg/day (16 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area). There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.



    Nursing Mothers



  It is not known whether dolasetron mesylate is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when ANZEMET Tablets are administered to a nursing woman.



    Pediatric Use



   (See  PRECAUTIONS, General  )  



 Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients (2 years and older) is based on pharmacokinetic studies and efficacy data in adults. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients under 2 years of age have not been established.



 ANZEMET Tablets are expected to be as safe and effective as when ANZEMET Injection is given orally to pediatric patients. ANZEMET Tablets are recommended for children old enough to swallow tablets (see  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics in Humans  ).



    Geriatric Use



  Elderly patients are at particular risk for prolongation of the PR, QRS, and QT interval; therefore, caution should be exercised and ECG monitoring should be performed when using ANZEMET in this population (see  WARNINGS  ).



 In controlled clinical trials in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, 301 (29%) of 1026 patients were 65 years of age or older. Of the 301 geriatric patients in the trial, 282 received oral ANZEMET Tablets. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between geriatric and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between geriatric and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.



 The pharmacokinetics, including clearance of oral ANZEMET Tablets, in elderly and younger patients are similar (see  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics in Humans  ). Dosage adjustment is not needed in patients over the age of 65.

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings">    WARNINGS



   QT Interval Prolongation



  ANZEMET prolongs the QT interval in a dose dependent fashion. Torsade de Pointes has been reported during post-marketing experience. Avoid ANZEMET in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, hypomagnesemia, or hypokalemia. Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia must be corrected prior to ANZEMET administration. Monitor these electrolytes after administration as clinically indicated. Use ECG monitoring in patients with congestive heart failure, bradycardia, renal impairment, and elderly patients (see  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  ).



    PR and QRS Interval Prolongation



  ANZEMET has been shown to cause dose dependent prolongation of the PR and QRS interval and reports of second or third degree atrioventricular block, cardiac arrest and serious ventricular arrhythmias including fatalities in both adult and pediatric patients. At particular risk are patients with underlying structural heart disease and preexisting conduction system abnormalities, elderly, patients with sick sinus syndrome, patients with atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response, patients with myocardial ischemia or patients receiving drugs known to prolong the PR interval (such as verapamil) and QRS interval (e.g., flecainide or quinidine). ANZEMET should be used with caution and with ECG monitoring in these patients. ANZEMET should be avoided in patients with complete heart block or at risk for complete heart block, unless they have an implanted pacemaker (see  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  ).



    Serotonin Syndrome



  The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of another 5-HT3receptor antagonist alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center.



 Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of Anzemet and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue Anzemet and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if Anzemet is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs (see  DRUG INTERACTIONS  ,  Patient Counseling Information  ).
