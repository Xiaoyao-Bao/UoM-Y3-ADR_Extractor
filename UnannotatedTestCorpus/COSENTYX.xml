  6.1     Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



   Plaque Psoriasis  



 A total of 3430 plaque psoriasis subjects were treated with COSENTYX in controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials. Of these, 1641 subjects were exposed for at least 1 year.



 Four placebo-controlled phase 3 trials in plaque psoriasis subjects were pooled to evaluate the safety of COSENTYX in comparison to placebo up to 12 weeks after treatment initiation, in Trials 1, 2, 3, and 4. In total, 2077 subjects were evaluated (691 to COSENTYX 300 mg group, 692 to COSENTYX 150 mg group, and 694 to placebo group)  [see Clinical Studies (14)]  .



 Table 1 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 1% and at a higher rate in the COSENTYX groups than the placebo group during the 12-week placebo-controlled period of the placebo-controlled trials.

   Infections  



 In the placebo-controlled period of the clinical trials in plaque psoriasis (a total of 1382 subjects treated with COSENTYX and 694 subjects treated with placebo up to 12 weeks), infections were reported in 28.7% of subjects treated with COSENTYX compared with 18.9% of subjects treated with placebo. Serious infections occurred in 0.14% of patients treated with COSENTYX and in 0.3% of patients treated with placebo  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]  .



 Over the entire treatment period (a total of 3430 plaque psoriasis subjects treated with COSENTYX for up to 52 weeks for the majority of subjects), infections were reported in 47.5% of subjects treated with COSENTYX (0.9 per patient-year of follow-up). Serious infections were reported in 1.2% of subjects treated with COSENTYX (0.015 per patient-year of follow-up).



 Phase 3 data showed an increasing trend for some types of infection with increasing serum concentration of secukinumab. Candida infections, herpes viral infections, staphylococcal skin infections, and infections requiring treatment increased as serum concentration of secukinumab increased.



 Neutropenia was observed in clinical trials. Most cases of secukinumab-associated neutropenia were transient and reversible. No serious infections were associated with cases of neutropenia.



   Inflammatory Bowel Disease  



 Cases of inflammatory bowel disease, in some cases serious, were observed in clinical trials with COSENTYX. In the plaque psoriasis program, with 3430 patients exposed to COSENTYX over the entire treatment period for up to 52 weeks (2725 patient-years), there were 3 cases (0.11 per 100 patient-years) of exacerbation of Crohn's disease, 2 cases (0.08 per 100 patient-years) of exacerbation of ulcerative colitis, and 2 cases (0.08 per 100 patient-years) of new onset ulcerative colitis. There were no cases in placebo patients (N = 793; 176 patient-years) during the 12 week placebo-controlled period.



 One case of exacerbation of Crohn's disease was reported from long-term non-controlled portions of ongoing clinical trials in plaque psoriasis  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]  .



   Hypersensitivity Reactions  



 Anaphylaxis and cases of urticaria occurred in COSENTYX treated patients in clinical trials  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]  .



   Psoriatic Arthritis  



 COSENTYX was studied in two placebo-controlled psoriatic arthritis trials with 1003 patients (703 patients on COSENTYX and 300 patients on placebo). Of the 703 patients who received COSENTYX, 299 patients received a subcutaneous loading dose of COSENTYX (PsA1) and 404 patients received an intravenous loading dose of secukinumab (PsA2) followed by COSENTYX administered by subcutaneous injection every four weeks. During the 16-week placebo-controlled period of the trials in patients with psoriatic arthritis, the overall proportion of patients with adverse events was similar in the secukinumab and placebo-treatment groups (59% and 58%, respectively). The adverse events that occurred at a proportion of at least 2% and at a higher proportion in the COSENTYX groups than the placebo groups during the 16-week placebo-controlled period were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, nausea, and hypercholesterolemia. The safety profile observed in patients with psoriatic arthritis treated with COSENTYX is consistent with the safety profile in psoriasis.



 Similar to the clinical trials in patients with psoriasis, there was an increased proportion of patients with infections in the COSENTYX groups (29%) compared to placebo group (26%)  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]  .



 There were cases of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis that include patients who experienced either exacerbations or the development of new disease. There were three cases of inflammatory bowel disease, of which two patients received secukinumab and one received placebo  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]  .



   Ankylosing Spondylitis  



 COSENTYX was studied in two placebo controlled ankylosing spondylitis trials with 590 patients (394 patients on COSENTYX and 196 patients on placebo). Of the 394 patients who received COSENTYX, 145 patients received a subcutaneous load of COSENTYX (study AS1) and 249 received an intravenous loading dose of secukinumab (study AS2) followed by COSENTYX administered by subcutaneous injection every four weeks. During the 16-week placebo-controlled period of the trials in patients with ankylosing spondylitis, the overall proportion of patients with adverse events was higher in the secukinumab groups than the placebo-treatment groups (66% and 59%, respectively). The adverse events that occurred at a proportion of at least 2% and at a higher proportion in the COSENTYX groups than the placebo groups during the 16-week placebo-controlled period were nasopharyngitis, nausea, and upper respiratory tract infection. The safety profile observed in patients with ankylosing spondylitis treated with COSENTYX is consistent with the safety profile in psoriasis.



 Similar to clinical trials in patients with psoriasis, there was an increased proportion of patients with infections in the COSENTYX groups (31%) compared to the placebo group (18%)  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]  .



 In the ankylosing spondylitis program, with 571 patients exposed to COSENTYX there were 8 cases of inflammatory bowel disease during the entire treatment period [5 Crohn's (0.7 per 100 patient-years) and 3 ulcerative colitis (0.4 per 100 patient-years)]. During the placebo-controlled 16-week period, there were 2 Crohn's disease exacerbations and 1 new onset ulcerative colitis case that was a serious adverse event in patients treated with COSENTYX compared to none of the patients treated with placebo. During the remainder of the study when all patients received COSENTYX, 1 patient developed Crohn's disease, 2 patients had Crohn's exacerbations, 1 patient developed ulcerative colitis, and 1 patient had an ulcerative colitis exacerbation  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]  .



   6.2     Immunogenicity

  As with all therapeutic proteins, there is the potential for immunogenicity. The immunogenicity of COSENTYX was evaluated using an electrochemiluminescence-based bridging immunoassay. Less than 1% of subjects treated with COSENTYX developed antibodies to secukinumab in up to 52 weeks of treatment. However, this assay has limitations in detecting anti-secukinumab antibodies in the presence of secukinumab; therefore the incidence of antibody development might not have been reliably determined. Of the subjects who developed antidrug antibodies, approximately one-half had antibodies that were classified as neutralizing. Neutralizing antibodies were not associated with loss of efficacy.



 The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of incidence of antibodies to COSENTYX with the incidences of antibodies to other products may be misleading.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">     5     WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  



   EXCERPT:    *   Infections : Serious infections have occurred. Caution should be exercised when considering the use of COSENTYX in patients with a chronic infection or a history of recurrent infection. If a serious infection develops, discontinue COSENTYX until the infection resolves. (  5.1  ) 
 *   Tuberculosis (TB) : Prior to initiating treatment with COSENTYX, evaluate for TB. (  5.2  ) 
 *   Inflammatory Bowel Disease : Cases of inflammatory bowel disease were observed in clinical trials. Caution should be exercised when prescribing COSENTYX to patients with inflammatory bowel disease. (  5.3  ) 
 *   Hypersensitivity Reactions : If an anaphylactic reaction or other serious allergic reaction occurs, discontinue COSENTYX immediately and initiate appropriate therapy. (  5.4  ) 
    
 

   5.1     Infections



  COSENTYX may increase the risk of infections. In clinical trials, a higher rate of infections was observed in COSENTYX treated subjects compared to placebo-treated subjects. In placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, higher rates of common infections such as nasopharyngitis (11.4% versus 8.6%), upper respiratory tract infection (2.5% versus 0.7%) and mucocutaneous infections with candida (1.2% versus 0.3%) were observed with COSENTYX compared with placebo. A similar increase in risk of infection was seen in placebo-controlled trials in patients with psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]  . The incidence of some types of infections appeared to be dose-dependent in clinical studies [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]  .



 Exercise caution when considering the use of COSENTYX in patients with a chronic infection or a history of recurrent infection.



 Instruct patients to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of an infection occur. If a patient develops a serious infection, the patient should be closely monitored and COSENTYX should be discontinued until the infection resolves.



    5.2     Pre-treatment Evaluation for Tuberculosis



  Evaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating treatment with COSENTYX. Do not administer COSENTYX to patients with active TB infection. Initiate treatment of latent TB prior to administering COSENTYX. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiation of COSENTYX in patients with a past history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed. Patients receiving COSENTYX should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of active TB during and after treatment.



    5.3     Inflammatory Bowel Disease



  Caution should be used when prescribing COSENTYX to patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Exacerbations, in some cases serious, occurred in COSENTYX treated patients during clinical trials in plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. In addition, new onset inflammatory bowel disease cases occurred in clinical trials with COSENTYX. In an exploratory study in 59 patients with active Crohn's disease, there were trends toward greater disease activity and increased adverse events in the secukinumab group as compared to the placebo group. Patients who are treated with COSENTYX should be monitored for signs and symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]  .



    5.4     Hypersensitivity Reactions



  Anaphylaxis and cases of urticaria occurred in COSENTYX treated patients in clinical trials. If an anaphylactic or other serious allergic reaction occurs, administration of COSENTYX should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]  .



    5.5     Risk of Hypersensitivity in Latex-sensitive Individuals



  The removable cap of the COSENTYX Sensoready pen and the COSENTYX prefilled syringe contains natural rubber latex which may cause an allergic reaction in latex-sensitive individuals. The safe use of COSENTYX Sensoready pen or prefilled syringe in latex-sensitive individuals has not been studied.



    5.6     Vaccinations



  Prior to initiating therapy with COSENTYX, consider completion of all age appropriate immunizations according to current immunization guidelines. Patients treated with COSENTYX should not receive live vaccines.



 Non-live vaccinations received during a course of COSENTYX may not elicit an immune response sufficient to prevent disease.
