      Clinical Trials Experience
   Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 VICOPROFEN was administered to approximately 300 pain patients in a safety study that employed dosages and a duration of treatment sufficient to encompass the recommended usage  (see  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  )  . Adverse event rates generally increased with increasing daily dose. The event rates reported below are from approximately 150 patients who were in a group that received one tablet of VICOPROFEN an average of three to four times daily. The overall incidence rates of adverse experiences in the trials were fairly similar for this patient group and those who received the comparison treatment, acetaminophen 600 mg with codeine 60 mg.



 The following lists adverse events that occurred with an incidence of 1% or greater in clinical trials of VICOPROFEN, without regard to the causal relationship of the events to the drug. To distinguish different rates of occurrence in clinical studies, the adverse events are listed as follows:



 *   name of adverse event = less than 3%  
 *   adverse events marked with an asterisk * = 3% to 9%

   Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of hydrocodone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Serotonin syndrome:  Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs.



   Adrenal insufficiency:  Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use.



   Anaphylaxis:      Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in VICOPROFEN.

    BOXED WARNING: 

  WARNING: ADDICTION, ABUSE, AND MISUSE; LIFE-THREATENING RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION; ACCIDENTAL INGESTION; NEONATAL OPIOID WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME;  CYTOCHROME P450 3A4 INTERACTION; RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH BENZODIAZEPINES OR OTHER CNS DEPRESSANTS; and SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR AND GASTROINTESTINAL EVENTS



   Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse  



 VICOPROFEN exposes patients and other users to the risks of opioid addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess each patient's risk prior to prescribing VICOPROFEN, and monitor all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors and conditions   (see WARNINGS:   Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse  )  .



   Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression  



 Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of VICOPROFEN. Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of VICOPROFEN or following a dose increase   (see WARNINGS:   Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression  )  .



   Accidental Ingestion   



 Accidental ingestion of even one dose of VICOPROFEN, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of hydrocodone   (see WARNINGS:   Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression  )  .



   Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome   



 Prolonged use of VICOPROFEN during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available   (see WARNINGS:   Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome  )  .



   Cytochrome P450 3A4 Interaction   



 The concomitant use of VICOPROFEN with all cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may result in an increase in hydrocodone plasma concentrations, which may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. In addition, discontinuation of a concomitantly used cytochrome P450 3A4 inducer may result in an increase in hydrocodone plasma concentration. Monitor patients taking VICOPROFEN and any CYP3A4 inhibitor or upon discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inducer for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation   (see WARNINGS:   Risks of Concomitant Use or Discontinuation of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers  , PRECAUTIONS:   Drug Interactions  )  .



   Risks From Concomitant Use With Benzodiazepines Or Other CNS Depressants  



 Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death   (see WARNINGS:   Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants  , PRECAUTIONS:   Drug Interactions  )  .



 *  Reserve concomitant prescribing of VICOPROFEN and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. 
 *  Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. 
 *  Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. 
      Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events  
 

 *  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) cause an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke, which can be fatal. This risk may occur early in treatment and may increase with duration of use (see WARNINGS: Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events). 
 *  VICOPROFEN is contraindicated in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS: Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events). 
      Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation  
 

 NSAIDs cause an increased risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines, which can be fatal. These events can occur at any time during use and without warning symptoms. Elderly patients and patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding are at greater risk for serious GI events   (see WARNINGS:   Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation  )  .

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings">    WARNINGS



   Hydrocodone Component



   Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse  



 VICOPROFEN contains hydrocodone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid-containing product, VICOPROFEN exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse (see  DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE  )  .



 Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed VICOPROFEN. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused.



 Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing VICOPROFEN, and monitor all patients receiving VICOPROFEN for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioid-containing products such as VICOPROFEN, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of VICOPROFEN along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse.



 Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders, and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing VICOPROFEN. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug (see PRECAUTIONS:  Information for Patients  )  . Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.



    Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression  



 Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status (see  OVERDOSAGE  )  . Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.



 While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of VICOPROFEN, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24-72 hours of initiating therapy with and following dosage increases of VICOPROFEN.



 To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of VICOPROFEN are essential (see  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  )  . Overestimating the VICOPROFEN dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose.



 Accidental ingestion of even one dose of VICOPROFEN, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of VICOPROFEN.



    Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome  



 Prolonged use of VICOPROFEN during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available (see PRECAUTIONS:  Pregnancy  ,  Information for Patients  )  .



    Risks of Concomitant Use or Discontinuation of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers  



 Concomitant use of VICOPROFEN with a CYP3A4 inhibitor, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may increase plasma concentrations of hydrocodone and prolong opioid adverse reactions, which may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression (see WARNINGS:  Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression  )  , particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of VICOPROFEN is achieved. Similarly, discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inducer, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, in VICOPROFEN -treated patients may increase hydrocodone plasma concentrations and prolong opioid adverse reactions. When using VICOPROFEN with CYP3A4 inhibitors or discontinuing CYP3A4 inducers in VICOPROFEN -treated patients, monitor patients closely at frequent intervals and consider dosage reduction of VICOPROFEN until stable drug effects are achieved (see  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  , PRECAUTIONS:  Drug Interactions  )  .



 Concomitant use of VICOPROFEN with CYP3A4 inducers or discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inhibitor could decrease hydrocodone plasma concentrations, decrease opioid efficacy or, possibly, lead to a withdrawal syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to hydrocodone. When using VICOPROFEN with CYP3A4 inducers or discontinuing CYP3A4 inhibitors, monitor patients closely at frequent intervals and consider increasing the opioid dosage if needed to maintain adequate analgesia or if symptoms of opioid withdrawal occur (see  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  , PRECAUTIONS:  Drug Interactions  )  .



    Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants  



 Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of VICOPROFEN with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.



 Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics (see PRECAUTIONS:  Drug Interactions  )  .



 If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.



 Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when VICOPROFEN is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs (see PRECAUTIONS:  Drug Interactions  ,  Information for Patients  )  .



    Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients  



 The use of VICOPROFEN in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated.



  Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease:  VICOPROFEN-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of VICOPROFEN (see WARNINGS:  Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression  )  .



  Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients:  Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients (see WARNINGS:  Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression  )  .



 Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating VICOPROFEN and when VICOPROFEN is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration (see WARNINGS:  Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression  )  . Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients.



    Adrenal Insufficiency  



 Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.



    Severe Hypotension  



 VICOPROFEN may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) (see PRECAUTIONS:  Drug Interactions  )  . Monitor these patients for   signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of VICOPROFEN. In patients with circulatory shock, VICOPROFEN may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of VICOPROFEN in patients with circulatory shock.



    Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness  



 In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2    retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), VICOPROFEN may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with VICOPROFEN.



 Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of VICOPROFEN in patients with impaired consciousness or coma.



    Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions  



 VICOPROFEN is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus.



 The hydrocodone in VICOPROFEN may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms.



    Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders  



 The hydrocodone in VICOPROFEN may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during VICOPROFEN therapy.



    Withdrawal  



 Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including VICOPROFEN. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms (see PRECAUTIONS:  Drug Interactions  )  .



 When discontinuing VICOPROFEN in a physically-dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage (see  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  )  . Do not abruptly discontinue VICOPROFEN in these patients (see  DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE  )  .



    Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery  



 VICOPROFEN may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of VICOPROFEN and know how they will react to the medication (see PRECAUTIONS:  Information for Patients  )  .



    Ibuprofen Component



    Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events  



  Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.



 To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.



 There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as ibuprofen, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events (see WARNINGS:  Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation  )  .



    Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery  



 Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10-14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG (see  CONTRAINDICATIONS  )  .



    Post-MI Patients  



 Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up.



 Avoid the use of VICOPROFEN in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If VICOPROFEN is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.



    Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation  



 NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with VICOPROFEN. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3-6 months, and in about 2%-4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk.



    Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation  



 Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.



  Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients:  



 *  Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration. 
 *  Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time. 
 *  Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For high risk patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs. 
 *  Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy. 
 *  If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue VICOPROFEN until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. 
 *  In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding (see PRECAUTIONS:  Drug Interactions  ) . 
     Hepatotoxicity  
 

 Elevations of ALT or AST (three or more times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) have been reported in approximately 1% of NSAID-treated patients in clinical trials with NSAIDS. In addition, rare, sometimes fatal, cases of severe hepatic injury, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure have been reported.



 Elevations of ALT or AST (less than three times ULN) may occur in up to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs including ibuprofen.



 Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flulike" symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue VICOPROFEN immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient.



  Hypertension  



 NSAID-containing products, including VICOPROFEN, can lead to new onset or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs (see PRECAUTIONS:  Drug Interactions  )  .



 Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.



  Heart Failure and Edema  



 The Coxib and Traditional NSAID Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death.



 Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of VICOPROFEN may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) (see PRECAUTIONS:  Drug Interactions  )  .



 Avoid the use of VICOPROFEN in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If VICOPROFEN is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure.



  Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia  



  Renal Toxicity  



 Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.



 Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy was usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.



 No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of VICOPROFEN in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of VICOPROFEN may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with pre-existing renal disease.



 Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating VICOPROFEN. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of VICOPROFEN (see PRECAUTIONS:  Drug Interactions  )  . Avoid the use of VICOPROFEN in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If VICOPROFEN is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.



  Hyperkalemia  



 Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, those effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.



  Anaphylactic Reactions  



 Ibuprofen has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to ibuprofen and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma (see  CONTRAINDICATIONS  , WARNINGS:  Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity  )  .



 Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs.



  Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity  



 A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, VICOPROFEN is contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity (see  CONTRAINDICATIONS  )  . When VICOPROFEN is used in patients with pre-existing asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma.



  Serious Skin Reactions  



 NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, can cause serious skin adverse events such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of VICOPROFEN at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. VICOPROFEN is contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs (see  CONTRAINDICATIONS  )  .



  Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus  



 Ibuprofen may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Avoid use of NSAID-containing products, including VICOPROFEN, in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of gestation (third trimester) (see PRECAUTIONS:  Pregnancy  )  .



    Hematologic Toxicity  



 Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with VICOPROFEN has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit.



 NSAID-containing products, including VICOPROFEN, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders, concomitant use of warfarin, other anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding (see PRECAUTIONS:  Drug Interactions  )  .



    Aseptic Meningitis  



 Aseptic meningitis with fever and coma has been observed on rare occasions in patients on ibuprofen therapy as found in VICOPROFEN. Although it is probably more likely to occur in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and related connective tissue diseases, it has been reported in patients who do not have an underlying chronic disease. If signs or symptoms of meningitis develop in a patient on VICOPROFEN, the possibility of its being related to ibuprofen should be considered.
