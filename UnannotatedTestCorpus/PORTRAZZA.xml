  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The safety of PORTRAZZA was evaluated in two randomized, open-label trials comparing PORTRAZZA plus gemcitabine and cisplatin to gemcitabine and cisplatin alone in patients with squamous NSCLC (Study 1), and PORTRAZZA plus pemetrexed and cisplatin to pemetrexed and cisplatin alone in patients with non-squamous NSCLC (Study 2). Since the data in Study 2 demonstrated similar incidence of adverse reactions over control as observed in Study 1, the safety data from Study 1 alone is described below.



 For patients who received at least 1 dose of treatment in Study 1, the median age was 62 years (range 32 to 84), 83% were male; 84% were Caucasian; and 92% were smokers. Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 or 1 for 91%, and 2 for 9% of patients; 90% had metastatic disease in 2 or more sites. Patients received PORTRAZZA 800 mg intravenously on days 1 and 8 of each 21 day cycle in combination with up to six cycles of gemcitabine (1250 mg/m  2  on days 1 and 8) and cisplatin (75 mg/m  2  on day 1). Patients received PORTRAZZA until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity.



 Patients in the gemcitabine and cisplatin alone arm received a maximum of 6 cycles, while patients in the PORTRAZZA plus gemcitabine and cisplatin arm demonstrating at least stable disease were permitted to continue to receive additional cycles of PORTRAZZA until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median duration of exposure to PORTRAZZA in 538 patients who received at least 1 dose of treatment in Study 1 was 4.6 months (range 0.5 months to 34 months), including 182 patients exposed for at least 6 months and 41 patients exposed for greater than 1 year. Patients were monitored for safety until 30 days after treatment discontinuation and resolution of treatment-emergent adverse events.



 The most common adverse reactions (all grades) observed in PORTRAZZA-treated patients at a rate of &gt;=15% and &gt;=2% higher than gemcitabine and cisplatin alone were rash (44%), vomiting (29%), diarrhea (16%), and dermatitis acneiform (15%). The most common severe (Grade 3 or higher) adverse events that occurred at a &gt;=2% higher rate in PORTRAZZA-treated patients compared to patients treated with gemcitabine and cisplatin alone were venous thromboembolic events (5%; including pulmonary embolism), rash (4%), and vomiting (3%).



   Table 1  contains selected adverse drug reactions observed in Study 1 at an incidence of &gt;=5% in the PORTRAZZA arm and at &gt;=2% higher incidence than the control arm.

           Clinically relevant adverse reactions (all grades) reported in &gt;=1% and &lt;5% of patients treated with PORTRAZZA were: dysphagia (3%), oropharyngeal pain (1%), muscle spasms (2%), phlebitis (2%), and hypersensitivity/IRR (1.5%).
 

 In Study 1, 12% of the patients on the PORTRAZZA arm discontinued study treatment due to an adverse reaction. The most common PORTRAZZA related toxicity leading to PORTRAZZA discontinuation was skin rash (1%).



   Table 2  contains selected electrolyte abnormalities observed in Study 1 according to laboratory assessment at an incidence of &gt;10% in the PORTRAZZA arm and at &gt;2% higher incidence than the control arm.



 The median time to onset of hypomagnesemia was 6 weeks (25  th  percentile 4 weeks; 75  th  percentile 9 weeks). Hypomagnesemia was reported as resolved in 43% of the patients who received PORTRAZZA. In Study 1, 32% of the patients in the PORTRAZZA arm and 16% of the patients who received gemcitabine and cisplatin alone received magnesium replacement.

               6.2 Immunogenicity
   As with all therapeutic proteins, there is the potential for immunogenicity. In clinical trials, treatment-emergent anti-necitumumab antibodies (ADA) were detected in 4.1% (33/814) of patients using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Neutralizing antibodies were detected in 1.4% (11/814) of patients post exposure to PORTRAZZA. No relationship was found between the presence of ADA and incidence of infusion-related reactions. The impact of ADA on efficacy (overall survival) could not be assessed due to the limited number of patients with treatment-emergent ADA. In Study 1, the exposure to necitumumab was lower in patients with ADA post-treatment than in patients without detectable ADA  [see Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )]  .



 The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of incidence of antibodies to PORTRAZZA with the incidences of antibodies to other products may be misleading.

   5.1 Cardiopulmonary Arrest



  Cardiopulmonary arrest or sudden death occurred in 15 (3%) of 538 patients treated with PORTRAZZA plus gemcitabine and cisplatin as compared to 3 (0.6%) of 541 patients treated with gemcitabine and cisplatin alone in Study 1. Twelve of the fifteen patients died within 30 days of the last dose of PORTRAZZA and had comorbid conditions including history of coronary artery disease (n=3), hypomagnesemia (n=4), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n=7), and hypertension (n=5). Eleven of the 12 patients had an unwitnessed death. Patients with significant coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction within 6 months, uncontrolled hypertension, and uncontrolled congestive heart failure were not enrolled in Study 1. The incremental risk of cardiopulmonary arrest or sudden death in patients with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, or arrhythmias as compared to those without these comorbid conditions is not known.



 Closely monitor serum electrolytes, including serum magnesium, potassium, and calcium prior to each infusion of PORTRAZZA during treatment and after PORTRAZZA administration for at least 8 weeks after the last dose. Withhold PORTRAZZA for Grade 3 or 4 electrolyte abnormalities; subsequent cycles of PORTRAZZA may be administered in these patients once electrolyte abnormalities have improved to Grade &lt;=2. Replete electrolytes as medically appropriate [see  Boxed Warning  and Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )]  .



    5.2 Hypomagnesemia



  Hypomagnesemia occurred in 83% of 461/538 patients with available laboratory results treated with PORTRAZZA as compared to 70% of 457/541 patients with available laboratory results treated with gemcitabine and cisplatin alone in Study 1. Hypomagnesemia was severe (Grade 3 or 4) in 20% of the patients treated with PORTRAZZA compared to 7% of the patients treated with gemcitabine and cisplatin alone. The median time to development of hypomagnesemia and accompanying electrolyte abnormalities was 6 weeks (25  th  percentile 4 weeks; 75  th  percentile 9 weeks) after initiation of PORTRAZZA. Monitor patients for hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, and hypokalemia prior to each infusion of PORTRAZZA during treatment and for at least 8 weeks following the completion of PORTRAZZA. Withhold PORTRAZZA for Grade 3 or 4 electrolyte abnormalities; subsequent cycles of PORTRAZZA may be administered in these patients once hypomagnesemia and related electrolyte abnormalities have improved to Grade &lt;=2. Replete electrolytes as medically appropriate [see  Boxed Warning  , Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  ), and   Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )   ].  



    5.3 Venous and Arterial Thromboembolic Events



  Venous and arterial thromboembolic events (VTE and ATE), some fatal, were observed with PORTRAZZA in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin. In Study 1, the incidence of VTE was 9% in patients receiving PORTRAZZA plus gemcitabine and cisplatin versus 5% in patients receiving gemcitabine and cisplatin alone and the incidence of Grade 3 or higher VTE was 5% versus 3%, respectively. The incidence of fatal VTEs was similar between arms (0.2% versus 0.2%). The most common VTEs were pulmonary embolism (5%) and deep-vein thrombosis (2%).



 The incidence of ATEs of any grade was 5% versus 4% and the incidence of Grade 3 or higher ATE was 4% versus 2% in the PORTRAZZA containing and gemcitabine and cisplatin arms, respectively, in Study 1. The most common ATEs were cerebral stroke and ischemia (2%) and myocardial infarction (1%).



 In an exploratory analysis of Study 1, the relative risk of VTE or ATE was approximately 3-fold higher in patients with a reported history of VTE or ATE than in patients with no reported history of VTE or ATE.



 Discontinue PORTRAZZA for patients with serious or life threatening VTE or ATE.



    5.4 Dermatologic Toxicities



  Dermatologic toxicities, including rash, dermatitis acneiform, acne, dry skin, pruritus, generalized rash, skin fissures, maculo-papular rash and erythema, occurred in 79% of patients receiving PORTRAZZA in Study 1. Skin toxicity was severe in 8% of patients. Skin toxicity usually developed within the first 2 weeks of therapy and resolved within 17 weeks after onset. For Grade 3 skin reactions, modify the dose of PORTRAZZA [see Dosage and Administration (  2.3  ) and Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . Limit sun exposure [see Patient Counseling Information (  17  )]  .



 Discontinue PORTRAZZA for severe (Grade 4) skin reactions, or for Grade 3 skin induration/fibrosis.



    5.5 Infusion-Related Reactions



  In Study 1, 1.5% of PORTRAZZA treated patients experienced IRRs of any severity with 0.4% Grade 3 IRR. No patients received premedication for IRR for the first dose of PORTRAZZA in Study 1. Most IRRs occurred after the first or second administration of PORTRAZZA. Monitor patients during and following PORTRAZZA infusion for signs and symptoms of IRR. Discontinue PORTRAZZA for serious or life-threatening IRR [see Dosage and Administration (  2.3  ) and Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  .



    5.6 Non-Squamous NSCLC - Increased Toxicity and Increased Mortality



  PORTRAZZA is not indicated for the treatment of patients with non-squamous NSCLC. In a study of PORTRAZZA plus pemetrexed and cisplatin (PC) versus PC alone (Study 2), patients treated with PORTRAZZA and PC experienced more serious (51% versus 41%) and fatal toxicities (16% versus 10%) and cardiopulmonary arrest/sudden death within 30 days of the last study drug (3.3% versus 1.3%) compared to patients who received PC alone [see Clinical Studies (  14.2  )]  .



    5.7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  Based on animal data and its mechanism of action, PORTRAZZA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Disruption or depletion of EGFR in animal models results in impairment of embryofetal development including effects on placental, lung, cardiac, skin, and neural development. The absence of EGFR signaling has resulted in embryolethality as well as post-natal death in animals. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with PORTRAZZA and for three months following the final dose [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  ,  8.3  )  and Clinical Pharmacology (  12.1  )]  .
