  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The safety of OFEV was evaluated in over 1000 IPF patients with over 200 patients exposed to OFEV for more than 2 years in clinical trials.



 OFEV was studied in three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 52-week trials. In the phase 2 (Study 1) and phase 3 (Studies 2 and 3) trials, 723 patients with IPF received OFEV 150 mg twice daily and 508 patients received placebo. The median duration of exposure was 10 months for patients treated with OFEV and 11 months for patients treated with placebo. Subjects ranged in age from 42 to 89 years (median age of 67 years). Most patients were male (79%) and Caucasian (60%).



 The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in patients treated with OFEV, more than placebo, were bronchitis (1.2% vs. 0.8%) and myocardial infarction (1.5% vs. 0.4%). The most common adverse events leading to death in patients treated with OFEV, more than placebo, were pneumonia (0.7% vs. 0.6%), lung neoplasm malignant (0.3% vs. 0%), and myocardial infarction (0.3% vs. 0.2%). In the predefined category of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) including MI, fatal events were reported in 0.6% of OFEV-treated patients and 1.8% of placebo-treated patients.



 Adverse reactions leading to permanent dose reductions were reported in 16% of OFEV-treated patients and 1% of placebo-treated patients. The most frequent adverse reaction that led to permanent dose reduction in the patients treated with OFEV was diarrhea (11%).



 Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were reported in 21% of OFEV-treated patients and 15% of placebo-treated patients. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to discontinuation in OFEV-treated patients were diarrhea (5%), nausea (2%), and decreased appetite (2%).



 The most common adverse reactions with an incidence of greater than or equal to 5% and more frequent in the OFEV than placebo treatment group are listed in Table 1.

      In addition, hypothyroidism was reported in patients treated with OFEV, more than placebo (1.1% vs. 0.6%).
 

   Combination with Pirfenidone  Concomitant treatment with nintedanib and pirfenidone was investigated in an exploratory open-label, randomized (1:1) trial of nintedanib 150 mg twice daily with add-on pirfenidone (titrated to 801 mg three times a day) compared to nintedanib 150 mg twice daily alone in 105 randomized patients for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with gastrointestinal adverse events from baseline to Week 12. Gastrointestinal adverse events were in line with the established safety profile of each component and were experienced in 37 (70%) patients treated with pirfenidone added to nintedanib versus 27 (53%) patients treated with nintedanib alone.



 Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain (includes upper abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, and abdominal pain) were the most frequent adverse events reported in 20 (38%) versus 16 (31%), in 22 (42%) versus 6 (12%), in 15 (28%) versus 6 (12%) patients, and in 15 (28%) versus 7 (14%) treated with pirfenidone added to nintedanib versus nintedanib alone, respectively. More subjects reported AST or ALT elevations (&gt;=3x the upper limit of normal) when using pirfenidone in combination with nintedanib (n=3 (6%)) compared to nintedanib alone (n=0)  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  ,  5.3  )]  .



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of OFEV. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of OFEV: drug-induced liver injury  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )]  , non-serious and serious bleeding events, some of which were fatal  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.6  )],  pancreatitis, thrombocytopenia, rash, pruritus.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Hepatic impairment: OFEV is not recommended for use in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. In patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child Pugh A), the recommended dosage is 100 mg twice daily approximately 12 hours apart taken with food. Consider treatment interruption, or discontinuation for management of adverse reactions in these patients. (  2.2  ,  2.3  ,  5.1  ,  8.6  ,  12.3  ) 
 *  Elevated liver enzymes and drug-induced liver injury: ALT, AST, and bilirubin elevations have occurred with OFEV, including cases of drug-induced liver injury. In the postmarketing period, non-serious and serious cases of drug-induced liver injury, including severe liver injury with fatal outcome, have been reported. The majority of hepatic events occur within the first three months of treatment. Liver enzyme and bilirubin increases were reversible with dose modification or interruption in the majority of cases. Monitor ALT, AST, and bilirubin prior to initiation of treatment, at regular intervals during the first three months of treatment, and periodically thereafter or as clinically indicated. Temporary dosage reductions or discontinuations may be required. (  2.1  ,  2.3  ,  5.2  ) 
 *  Gastrointestinal disorders: Diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting have occurred with OFEV. Treat patients at first signs with adequate hydration and antidiarrheal medicine (e.g., loperamide) or anti-emetics. Discontinue OFEV if severe diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting persists despite symptomatic treatment. (  5.3  ) 
 *  Embryo-Fetal toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. (  5.4  ,  8.1  ,  8.3  ) 
 *  Arterial thromboembolic events have been reported. Use caution when treating patients at higher cardiovascular risk including known coronary artery disease. (  5.5  ) 
 *  Bleeding events have been reported. Use OFEV in patients with known bleeding risk only if anticipated benefit outweighs the potential risk. (  5.6  ) 
 *  Gastrointestinal perforation has been reported. Use OFEV with caution when treating patients with recent abdominal surgery, previous history of diverticular disease or receiving concomitant corticosteroids or NSAIDs. Discontinue OFEV in patients who develop gastrointestinal perforation. Only use OFEV in patients with known risk of gastrointestinal perforation if the anticipated benefit outweighs the potential risk. (  5.7  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Hepatic Impairment



  Treatment with OFEV is not recommended in patients with moderate (Child Pugh B) or severe (Child Pugh C) hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.6  ) and Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )]  . Patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child Pugh A) can be treated with a reduced dose of OFEV [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  )]  .



    5.2 Elevated Liver Enzymes and Drug-Induced Liver Injury



   Cases of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) have been observed with OFEV treatment. In the postmarketing period, non-serious and serious cases of DILI, including severe liver injury with fatal outcome, have been reported. The majority of hepatic events occur within the first three months of treatment. In clinical trials, administration of OFEV was associated with elevations of liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALKP, GGT) and bilirubin. Liver enzyme and bilirubin increases were reversible with dose modification or interruption in the majority of cases. The majority (94%) of patients with ALT and/or AST elevations had elevations less than 5 times ULN. The majority (95%) of patients with bilirubin elevations had elevations less than 2 times ULN [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.6  ) and Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )]  . Patients with a low body weight (less than 65 kg), Asian, and female patients may have a higher risk of elevations in liver enzymes. Nintedanib exposure increased with patient age, which may also result in a higher risk of increased liver enzymes [see Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )]  .  



  Conduct liver function tests (ALT, AST, and bilirubin) prior to initiation of treatment with OFEV, at regular intervals during the first three months of treatment, and periodically thereafter or as clinically indicated. Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. Dosage modifications or interruption may be necessary for liver enzyme elevations [see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  ,  2.3  )].    



    5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders



    Diarrhea    Diarrhea was the most frequent gastrointestinal event reported in 62% versus 18% of patients treated with OFEV and placebo, respectively [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )].  In most patients, the event was of mild to moderate intensity and occurred within the first 3 months of treatment. Diarrhea led to permanent dose reduction in 11% of patients treated with OFEV compared to 0 placebo-treated patients. Diarrhea led to discontinuation of OFEV in 5% of the patients compared to less than 1% of placebo-treated patients.
 

 Dosage modifications or treatment interruptions may be necessary in patients with adverse reactions of diarrhea. Treat diarrhea at first signs with adequate hydration and antidiarrheal medication (e.g., loperamide), and consider treatment interruption if diarrhea continues [see Dosage and Administration (  2.3  )].  OFEV treatment may be resumed at the full dosage (150 mg twice daily), or at the reduced dosage (100 mg twice daily), which subsequently may be increased to the full dosage. If severe diarrhea persists despite symptomatic treatment, discontinue treatment with OFEV.



   Nausea and Vomiting    Nausea was reported in 24% versus 7% and vomiting was reported in 12% versus 3% of patients treated with OFEV and placebo, respectively [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . In most patients, these events were of mild to moderate intensity. Nausea led to discontinuation of OFEV in 2% of patients. Vomiting led to discontinuation of OFEV in 1% of the patients.
 

 For nausea or vomiting that persists despite appropriate supportive care including anti-emetic therapy, dose reduction or treatment interruption may be required [see Dosage and Administration (  2.3  )]  . OFEV treatment may be resumed at the full dosage (150 mg twice daily), or at the reduced dosage (100 mg twice daily), which subsequently may be increased to the full dosage. If severe nausea or vomiting does not resolve, discontinue treatment with OFEV.



    5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, OFEV can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Nintedanib caused embryo-fetal deaths and structural abnormalities in rats and rabbits when administered during organogenesis at less than (rats) and approximately 5 times (rabbits) the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) in adults. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving treatment with OFEV and to use effective contraception during treatment and at least 3 months after the last dose of OFEV. Verify pregnancy status prior to treatment with OFEV [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  ,  8.3  ) and Clinical Pharmacology (  12.1  )]  .



    5.5 Arterial Thromboembolic Events



  Arterial thromboembolic events have been reported in patients taking OFEV. In clinical trials, arterial thromboembolic events were reported in 2.5% of patients treated with OFEV and 0.8% of placebo-treated patients. Myocardial infarction was the most common adverse reaction under arterial thromboembolic events, occurring in 1.5% of OFEV-treated patients compared to 0.4% of placebo-treated patients.



 Use caution when treating patients at higher cardiovascular risk including known coronary artery disease. Consider treatment interruption in patients who develop signs or symptoms of acute myocardial ischemia.



    5.6 Risk of Bleeding



   Based on the mechanism of action (VEGFR inhibition), OFEV may increase the risk of bleeding. In clinical trials, bleeding events were reported in 10% of patients treated with OFEV and in 7% of patients treated with placebo. In the postmarketing period non-serious and serious bleeding events, some of which were fatal, have been observed.  



  Use OFEV in patients with known risk of bleeding only if the anticipated benefit outweighs the potential risk.  



    5.7 Gastrointestinal Perforation



   Based on the mechanism of action, OFEV may increase the risk of gastrointestinal perforation. In clinical trials, gastrointestinal perforation was reported in 0.3% of patients treated with OFEV, compared to 0 cases in the placebo-treated patients. In the postmarketing period, cases of gastrointestinal perforations have been reported, some of which were fatal. Use caution when treating patients who have had recent abdominal surgery, previous history of diverticular disease or receiving concomitant corticosteroids or NSAIDs.  



  Discontinue therapy with OFEV in patients who develop gastrointestinal perforation. Only use OFEV in patients with known risk of gastrointestinal perforation if the anticipated benefit outweighs the potential risk.
