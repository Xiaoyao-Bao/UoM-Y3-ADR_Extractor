  The safety and efficacy of DITROPAN  (r)  (oxybutynin chloride) was evaluated in a total of 199 patients in three clinical trials. These participants were treated with DITROPAN 5-20 mg/day for up to 6 weeks. Table 3 shows the incidence of adverse events judged by investigators to be at least possibly related to treatment and reported by at least 5% of patients.

   Central Nervous System Effects



  Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects (See   ADVERSE REACTIONS    ). A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered.



 DITROPAN should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms.



    General



  DITROPAN  (r)  (oxybutynin chloride) should be used with caution in the frail elderly, in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with myasthenia gravis.



 DITROPAN may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy.



    Urinary Retention



  DITROPAN should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (see   CONTRAINDICATIONS    ).



    Gastrointestinal Disorders



  DITROPAN should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see   CONTRAINDICATIONS    ).



 Administration of DITROPAN to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease.



 DITROPAN, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony.



 DITROPAN should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis.



    Information for Patients



  Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing.



 Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature.



 Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution.



 Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin.



    Drug Interactions



  The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects.



 Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index.



 Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3-4 fold higher when DITROPAN was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor.



 Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., Cmaxand AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered.



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility



  A 24-month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area.



 Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae  and Salmonella typhimurium  test systems.



 Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility.



    Pregnancy



   Category B



  Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of DITROPAN administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, DITROPAN should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards.



    Nursing Mothers



  It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when DITROPAN is administered to a nursing woman.



    Pediatric Use



  The safety and efficacy of DITROPAN administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see   DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION    ).



 The safety and efficacy of DITROPAN Tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24-week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5-15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of DITROPAN was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters.



 At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with DITROPAN Tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with DITROPAN Tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H2O to 33 cm H2O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H2O) from 39% to 20%.



 As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, DITROPAN is not recommended for this age group.



    Geriatric Use



  Clinical studies of DITROPAN did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2-3 hours to 5 hours.  2,3,4  In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.
