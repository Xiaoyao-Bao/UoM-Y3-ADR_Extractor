   Hypersensitivity Reactions and Hypersensitivity Syndrome



    *     The following adverse events have been reported with minocycline products when taken orally. Hypersensitivity reactions and hypersensitivity syndrome that included, but were not limited to anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid reaction, angioneurotic edema, urticaria, rash, eosinophilia, and one or more of the following: hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis may be present. Swelling of the face, pruritus, fever and lymphadenopathy have been reported with the use of ARESTIN. Some of these reactions were serious. Post-marketing cases of anaphylaxis and serious skin reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and erythema multiforme have been reported with oral minocycline. 
       Autoimmune Syndromes
 

    *     Tetracyclines, including oral minocycline, have been associated with the development of autoimmune syndromes including a lupus-like syndrome manifested by arthralgia, myalgia, rash, and swelling. Sporadic cases of serum sickness-like reaction have presented shortly after oral minocycline use, manifested by fever, rash, arthralgia, lymphadenopathy and malaise. In symptomatic patients, liver function tests, ANA, CBC, and other appropriate tests should be performed to evaluate the patients. No further treatment with ARESTIN should be administered to the patient. 
    The use of ARESTIN in an acutely abscessed periodontal pocket has not been studied and is not recommended.
 

 While no overgrowth by opportunistic microorganisms, such as yeast, was noted during clinical studies, as with other antimicrobials, the use of ARESTIN may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible microorganisms including fungi. The effects of treatment for greater than 6 months have not been studied.



 ARESTIN should be used with caution in patients having a history of predisposition to oral candidiasis. The safety and effectiveness of ARESTIN have not been established for the treatment of periodontitis in patients with coexistent oral candidiasis.



 ARESTIN has not been clinically tested in immunocompromised patients (such as those immunocompromised by diabetes, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or infection with HIV).



 If superinfection is suspected, appropriate measures should be taken.



 ARESTIN has not been clinically tested in pregnant women.



 ARESTIN has not been clinically tested for use in the regeneration of alveolar bone, either in preparation for or in conjunction with the placement of endosseous (dental) implants or in the treatment of failing implants.



    Information for Patients



  After treatment, patients should avoid chewing hard, crunchy, or sticky foods (i.e., carrots, taffy, and gum) with the treated teeth for 1 week, as well as avoid touching treated areas. Patients should also postpone the use of interproximal cleaning devices around the treated sites for 10 days after administration of ARESTIN. Patients should be advised that although some mild to moderate sensitivity is expected during the first week after SRP and administration of ARESTIN, they should notify the dentist promptly if pain, swelling, or other problems occur. Patients should be notified to inform the dentist if itching, swelling, rash, papules, reddening, difficulty breathing, or other signs and symptoms of possible hypersensitivity occur.



    Carcinogenicity, Mutagenicity, Impairment of Fertility



  Dietary administration of minocycline in long-term tumorigenicity studies in rats resulted in evidence of thyroid tumor production. Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Minocycline demonstrated no potential to cause genetic toxicity in a battery of assays which included a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test), an in vitro  mammalian cell gene mutation test (L5178Y/TK  +/-  mouse lymphoma assay), an in vitro  mammalian chromosome aberration test, and an in vivo micronucleus assay conducted in ICR mice.



 Fertility and general reproduction studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats.



    Pregnancy



    Teratogenic Effects  :  (See   WARNINGS  .  )



    Labor and Delivery



  The effects of tetracyclines on labor and delivery are unknown.



    Nursing Mothers



  Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (see   WARNINGS    ).



    Pediatric Use



  Since adult periodontitis does not affect children, the safety and effectiveness of ARESTIN in pediatric patients cannot be established.

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings">    WARNINGS



  THE USE OF DRUGS OF THE TETRACYCLINE CLASS DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT (LAST HALF OF PREGNANCY, INFANCY, AND CHILDHOOD TO THE AGE OF 8 YEARS) MAY CAUSE PERMANENT DISCOLORATION OF THE TEETH (YELLOW-GRAY BROWN). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drugs, but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. TETRACYCLINE DRUGS, THEREFORE, SHOULD NOT BE USED IN THIS AGE GROUP, OR IN PREGNANT OR NURSING WOMEN, UNLESS THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS ARE CONSIDERED TO OUTWEIGH THE POTENTIAL RISKS. Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has also been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. If any tetracyclines are used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema.
