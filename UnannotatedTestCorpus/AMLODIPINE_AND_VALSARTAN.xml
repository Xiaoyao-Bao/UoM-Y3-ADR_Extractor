  EXCERPT:   In placebo-controlled clinical trials, discontinuation due to side effects occurred in 1.8% of patients in the amlodipine and valsartan tablet-treated patients and 2.1% in the placebo-treated group. The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with amlodipine and valsartan tablets were peripheral edema and vertigo. The adverse experiences that occurred in clinical trials (&gt;= 2% of patients) at a higher incidence than placebo included peripheral edema, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and dizziness. (  6.1  )

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates.



     Studies with Amlodipine Besylate and Valsartan Tablets  :  



 Amlodipine and valsartan tablets have been evaluated for safety in over 2600 patients with hypertension; over 1440 of these patients were treated for at least 6 months and over 540 of these patients were treated for at least 1 year. Adverse reactions have generally been mild and transient in nature and have only infrequently required discontinuation of therapy.



 The hazards  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5  )]  of valsartan are generally independent of dose; those of amlodipine are a mixture of dose-dependent phenomena (primarily peripheral edema) and dose-independent phenomena, the former much more common than the latter.



 The overall frequency of adverse reactions was neither dose-related nor related to gender, age, or race. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, discontinuation due to side effects occurred in 1.8% of patients in the amlodipine and valsartan tablet-treated patients and 2.1% in the placebo-treated group. The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with amlodipine and valsartan tablets were peripheral edema (0.4%), and vertigo (0.2%).



 The adverse reactions that occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials in at least 2% of patients treated with amlodipine and valsartan tablets but at a higher incidence in amlodipine/valsartan patients (n = 1437) than placebo (n = 337) included peripheral edema (5.4% vs 3.0%), nasopharyngitis (4.3% vs 1.8%), upper respiratory tract infection (2.9% vs 2.1%) and dizziness (2.1% vs 0.9%).



 Orthostatic events (orthostatic hypotension and postural dizziness) were seen in less than 1% of patients.

 Adverse reactions reported for amlodipine for indications other than hypertension may be found in the prescribing information for Norvasc  (r)  .



     Studies with Valsartan:    



 Diovan  (r)  (valsartan) has been evaluated for safety in more than 4000 hypertensive patients in clinical trials. In trials in which valsartan was compared to an ACE inhibitor with or without placebo, the incidence of dry cough was significantly greater in the ACE inhibitor group (7.9%) than in the groups who received valsartan (2.6%) or placebo (1.5%). In a 129-patient trial limited to patients who had had dry cough when they had previously received ACE inhibitors, the incidences of cough in patients who received valsartan, HCTZ, or lisinopril were 20%, 19%, and 69% respectively (p &lt; 0.001).



 Other adverse reactions, not listed above, occurring in &gt; 0.2% of patients in controlled clinical trials with valsartan are:



     Body as a Whole:    allergic reaction, asthenia



     Musculoskeletal:    muscle cramps



     Neurologic and Psychiatric:    paresthesia



     Respiratory:    sinusitis, pharyngitis



     Urogenital:    impotence



 Other reported events seen less frequently in clinical trials were: angioedema.



 Adverse reactions reported for valsartan for indications other than hypertension may be found in the prescribing information for Diovan  (r)  .



   Clinical Lab Test Findings:  



     Creatinine:    In hypertensive patients, greater than 50% increases in creatinine occurred in 0.4% of patients receiving amlodipine and valsartan tablets and 0.6% receiving placebo. In heart failure patients, greater than 50% increases in creatinine were observed in 3.9% of valsartan-treated patients compared to 0.9% of placebo-treated patients. In post-myocardial infarction patients, doubling of serum creatinine was observed in 4.2% of valsartan-treated patients and 3.4% of captopril-treated patients.



     Liver Function Tests:    Occasional elevations (greater than 150%) of liver chemistries occurred in amlodipine and valsartan tablet-treated patients.



     Serum Potassium:    In hypertensive patients, greater than 20% increases in serum potassium were observed in 2.8% of amlodipine and valsartan tablet-treated patients compared to 3.4% of placebo-treated patients. In heart failure patients, greater than 20% increases in serum potassium were observed in 10% of valsartan-treated patients compared to 5.1% of placebo-treated patients.



     Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN):    In hypertensive patients, greater than 50% increases in BUN were observed in 5.5% of amlodipine and valsartan tablet-treated patients compared to 4.7% of placebo-treated patients. In heart failure patients, greater than 50% increases in BUN were observed in 16.6% of valsartan-treated patients compared to 6.3% of placebo-treated patients.



     Neutropenia:    Neutropenia was observed in 1.9% of patients treated with Diovan  (r)  and 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

      Amlodipine:    Gynecomastia has been reported infrequently and a causal relationship is uncertain. Jaundice and hepatic enzyme elevations (mostly consistent with cholestasis or hepatitis), in some cases severe enough to require hospitalization, have been reported in association with use of amlodipine.

   General Information about amlodipine and valsartan tablets  



 Medicines are sometimes prescribed for conditions that are not mentioned in the patient information leaflet. Do not use amlodipine and valsartan tablets for a condition for which they were not prescribed. Do not give amlodipine and valsartan tablets to other people, even if they have the same symptoms that you have. They may harm them.



 This patient information leaflet summarizes the most important information about amlodipine and valsartan tablets. If you would like more information about amlodipine and valsartan tablets, talk with your doctor. You can ask your doctor or pharmacist for information about amlodipine and valsartan tablets that is written for health professionals. For more information please contact 1-888-838-2872.



   What are the ingredients in amlodipine and valsartan tablets?  



 Active ingredients: Amlodipine besylate, USP and valsartan, USP



 The inactive ingredients of the tablets are calcium phosphate dibasic, colloidal silicon dioxide, corn starch, crospovidone, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl alcohol, sodium starch glycolate, talc, and titanium dioxide. In addition, the 5 mg/160 mg, the 10 mg/160 mg and the 10 mg/320 mg strengths contain iron oxide yellow, and the 5 mg/320 mg strength contains D&amp;C yellow #10 aluminum lake, FD&amp;C yellow #6 aluminum lake, FD&amp;C red #40 aluminum lake and FD&amp;C blue #2 aluminum lake.



   What is high blood pressure (hypertension)?  



 Blood pressure is the force of blood in your blood vessels when your heart beats and when your heart rests. You have high blood pressure when the force is too much. Amlodipine and valsartan tablets can help your blood vessels relax so your blood pressure is lower. Medicines that lower blood pressure lower your chance of having a stroke or heart attack.



 High blood pressure makes the heart work harder to pump blood throughout the body and causes damage to blood vessels. If high blood pressure is not treated, it can lead to stroke, heart attack, heart failure, kidney failure, and vision problems.

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Hypotension: Correct volume depletion prior to initiation (  5.2  ) 
 *  Increased angina and/or myocardial infarction (  5.3  ) 
 *  Monitor renal function and potassium in susceptible patients (  5.4  ,  5.5  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Fetal Toxicity



   Pregnancy Category D  



 Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue amlodipine and valsartan tablets as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  )]  .



    5.2 Hypotension



  Excessive hypotension was seen in 0.4% of patients with uncomplicated hypertension treated with amlodipine and valsartan tablets in placebo-controlled studies. In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system, such as volume- and/or salt-depleted patients receiving high doses of diuretics, symptomatic hypotension may occur in patients receiving angiotensin receptor blockers. Volume depletion should be corrected prior to administration of amlodipine and valsartan tablets. Treatment with amlodipine and valsartan tablets should start under close medical supervision.



 Initiate therapy cautiously in patients with heart failure or recent myocardial infarction and in patients undergoing surgery or dialysis. Patients with heart failure or post-myocardial infarction patients given valsartan commonly have some reduction in blood pressure, but discontinuation of therapy because of continuing symptomatic hypotension usually is not necessary when dosing instructions are followed. In controlled trials in heart failure patients, the incidence of hypotension in valsartan-treated patients was 5.5% compared to 1.8% in placebo-treated patients. In the Valsartan in Acute Myocardial Infarction Trial (VALIANT), hypotension in post-myocardial infarction patients led to permanent discontinuation of therapy in 1.4% of valsartan-treated patients and 0.8% of captopril-treated patients.



 Since the vasodilation induced by amlodipine is gradual in onset, acute hypotension has rarely been reported after oral administration. Nonetheless, caution, as with any other peripheral vasodilator, should be exercised when administering amlodipine, particularly in patients with severe aortic stenosis.



 If excessive hypotension occurs with amlodipine and valsartan tablets, the patient should be placed in a supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized.



    5.3 Risk of Myocardial Infarction or Increased Angina



  Worsening angina and acute myocardial infarction can develop after starting or increasing the dose of amlodipine, particularly in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease.



    5.4 Impaired Renal Function



  Changes in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and by diuretics. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe congestive heart failure, or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing acute renal failure on amlodipine and valsartan tablets. Monitor renal function periodically in these patients. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on amlodipine and valsartan tablets [see Drug Interactions (  7  )]  .



    5.5 Hyperkalemia



  Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically.



 Some patients with heart failure have developed increases in potassium with valsartan therapy. These effects are usually minor and transient, and they are more likely to occur in patients with preexisting renal impairment. Dosage reduction and/or discontinuation of amlodipine valsartan tablets may be required [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  .
