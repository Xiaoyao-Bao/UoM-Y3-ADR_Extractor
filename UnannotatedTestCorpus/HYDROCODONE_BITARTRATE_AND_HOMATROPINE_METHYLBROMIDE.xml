    Central Nervous System:  



 Sedation, drowsiness, mental clouding, lethargy, impairment of mental and physical performance, anxiety, fear, dysphoria, dizziness, psychic dependence, mood changes.



   Gastrointestinal System:  



 Nausea and vomiting may occur; they are more frequent in ambulatory than in recumbent patients. Prolonged administration of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide tablets may produce constipation.



   Genitourinary System:  



 Ureteral spasm, spasm of vesicle sphincters and urinary retention have been reported with opiates.



   Respiratory Depression:

    BOXED WARNING: 

    WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH BENZODIAZEPINES OR OTHER CNS DEPRESSANTS  



   Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death (see Warnings, Precautions - Drug Interactions). Avoid use of opioid cough medications in patients taking benzodiazepines, other CNS depressants, or alcohol.

   General



  Before prescribing medication to suppress or modify cough, it is important to ascertain that the underlying cause of cough is identified, that modification of cough does not increase the risk of clinical or physiological complications, and that appropriate therapy for the primary disease is provided.



  Special Risk Patients:  



 Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets should be given with caution to certain patients such as the elderly or debilitated, and those with severe impairment of hepatic or renal functions, hypothyroidism, Addison's disease, prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture, asthma, and narrow-angle glaucoma.



    Information for Patients



  Inform patients and caregivers that potentially fatal additive effects may occur if Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol. Because of this risk, patients should avoid concomitant use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol (see   Warnings  ,  Precautions - Drug Interactions    ).



 Hydrocodone may produce marked drowsiness and impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery. The patient using Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets should be cautioned accordingly.



 Keep out of the reach of children.



    Drug Interactions



  The use of benzodiazepines, opioids, antihistamines, antipsychotics, anti-anxiety agents, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) concomitantly with Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide tablets may cause an additive CNS depressant effect, profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death and should be avoided (see   Warnings    ) .   



 The use of MAO inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants with hydrocodone preparations may increase the effect of either the antidepressant or hydrocodone.



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility



  Studies of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide tablets in animals to evaluate the carcinogenic and mutagenic potential and the effect on fertility have not been conducted.



    Pregnancy



   Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C:



  Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets. It is also not known whether Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.



    Nonteratogenic Effects



  Babies born to mothers who have been taking opioids regularly prior to delivery will be physically dependent. The withdrawal signs include: irritability and excessive crying, tremors, hyperactive reflexes, increased respiratory rate, increased stools, sneezing, yawning, vomiting and fever. The intensity of the syndrome does not always correlate with the duration of maternal opioid use or dose.



    Labor &amp; Delivery



  As with all opioids, administration of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide tablets to the mother shortly before delivery may result in some degree of respiratory depression in the newborn, especially if higher doses are used.



    Nursing Mothers



  It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide tablets, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.



    Pediatric Use



  Safety and effectiveness of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide tablets in pediatric patients under six have not been established. The use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide tablets in children less than 6 years of age has been associated with cases of fatal respiratory depression (see  ADVERSE REACTIONS  - Respiratory Depression  ). Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide tablets should be used with caution in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older (see  WARNINGS  - Pediatric Use  ).

   Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or other CNS Depressants  



 Concomitant use of opioids, including Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide tablets, with benzodiazepines, or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death .  Because of these risks, avoid use of opioid cough medications in patients taking benzodiazepines, other CNS depressants, or alcohol (see   Precautions - Drug Interactions    ).



 Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. Because of similar pharmacologic properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with concomitant use of opioid cough medications and benzodiazepines, other CNS depressants, or alcohol.



 Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation if Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide tablets is used with benzodiazepines, alcohol, or other CNS depressants (see   Precautions - Information for Patients    ) .   



 Hydrocodone can produce drug dependence of the morphine type and, therefore, has the potential for being abused. Psychic dependence, physical dependence and tolerance may develop upon repeated administration of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide tablets and it should be prescribed and administered with the same degree of caution appropriate to the use of other opioid drugs (SEE  DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE  ).



  Respiratory Depression:  



 The use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide tablets is not recommended for use in children less than 6 years of age because of the risk of fatal respiratory depression (see  ADVERSE REACTIONS  - Respiratory Depression). Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide tablets produce dose-related respiratory depression by directly acting on brain stem respiratory centers. If respiratory depression occurs, it may be antagonized by the use of naloxone hydrochloride and other supportive measures when indicated.



  Head Injury and Increased Intracranial Pressure:  



 The respiratory depression properties of opioids and their capacity to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of head injury, other intracranial lesions, or a pre-existing increase in intracranial pressure. Furthermore, opioids produce adverse reactions which may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injuries.



  Acute Abdominal Conditions:  



 The administration of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide tablets or other opioids may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions.



  Pediatric Use:  



 In pediatric patients, as well as adults, the respiratory center is sensitive to the depressant action of opioid cough suppressants in a dose-dependent manner. Caution should be exercised when administering Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide tablets to pediatric patients 6 years of age and older because of the potential for fatal respiratory depression. Overdose or concomitant administration of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide tablets with other respiratory depressants may increase the risk of respiratory depression in pediatric patients. Benefit to risk ratio should be carefully considered especially in the pediatric population with respiratory embarrassment (e.g., croup)(see  PRECAUTIONS  ).
