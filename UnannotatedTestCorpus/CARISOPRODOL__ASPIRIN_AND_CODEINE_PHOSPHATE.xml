    The following adverse reactions which have occurred with the administration of the individual products alone may also occur with the use of Carisoprodol, Aspirin and Codeine Phosphate Tablets. The following events have been reported during post-approval individual use of carisoprodol, aspirin, and codeine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
 

     Carisoprodol    



   Cardiovascular:  Tachycardia, postural hypotension, and facial flushing (see    OVERDOSAGE    ).



   Central Nervous System:  Drowsiness, dizziness, vertigo, ataxia, tremor, agitation, irritability, headache, depressive reactions, syncope, insomnia, and seizures (see    OVERDOSAGE    ).



   Gastrointestinal:  Nausea, vomiting, and epigastric discomfort.



   Hematologic:  Leukopenia, pancytopenia.



     Aspirin    



 The most common adverse reactions associated with the use of aspirin have been gastrointestinal, including both abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, gastritis, and occult bleeding (see    WARNINGS    ).    Other adverse reactions associated with the use of aspirin include elevated liver enzymes, rash, pruritus, purpura, intracranial hemorrhage, interstitial nephritis, acute renal failure, and tinnitus. Tinnitus may be a sign of high serum salicylate levels (see    OVERDOSAGE    ).



     Codeine Phosphate    



 Nausea, vomiting, constipation, miosis, sedation, dizziness.



   Adrenal insufficiency:  Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use.

  WARNING: ADDICTION, ABUSE, AND MISUSE. RISK EVALUATION AND MITIGATION STRATEGY (REMS); LIFE-THREATENING RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION; ACCIDENTAL INGESTION; ULTRA-RAPID METABOLISM OF CODEINE AND OTHER RISK FACTORS FOR LIFE- THREATENING RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION IN CHILDREN; NEONATAL OPIOID WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME; INTERACTIONS WITH DRUGS AFFECTING CYTOCHROME P450 ISOENZYMES; and RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH BENZODIAZEPINES OR OTHER CNS DEPRESSANTS

      Addiction, Abuse and Misuse    



   Carisoprodol, Aspirin and Codeine Phosphate Tablets expose patients and other users to the risks of opioid addiction, abuse and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess each patient's risk prior to prescribing Carisoprodol, Aspirin and Codeine Phosphate Tablets, and monitor all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors and conditions (see   WARNINGS  ).  



     Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)    



   To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse,  



   and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a REMS for these  



   products    (see   WARNINGS  ). Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with  



   approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs  



   available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to  



 *  complete a REMS-compliant education program, 
 *  counsel patients and/or their caregivers, with every prescription, on safe use, serious 
 *   risks, storage, and disposal of these products, 
 *  emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication 
 *   Guide every time it is provided by their pharmacist, and 
 *  consider other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety. 
        Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression    
 

   Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of Carisoprodol, Aspirin and Codeine Phosphate Tablets. Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of Carisoprodol, Aspirin and Codeine Phosphate Tablets or following a dose increase (see   WARNINGS  ).  



     Accidental Ingestion    



   Accidental ingestion of even one dose of Carisoprodol, Aspirin and Codeine Phosphate Tablets, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of Carisoprodol, Aspirin and Codeine Phosphate Tablets (see   WARNINGS  ).  



     Ultra-Rapid Metabolism of Codeine and Other Risk Factors for Life-Threatening    Respiratory     Depression in Children    



   Life-threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received codeine. Most of the reported cases occurred following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy, and many of the children had evidence of being an ultra-rapid metabolizer of codeine due to a CYP2D6 polymorphism (see   WARNINGS  ).  



   Carisoprodol, Aspirin and Codeine Phosphate Tablets are contraindicated in children younger than 12 years of age and in children younger than 18 years of age following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy (see   CONTRAINDICATIONS  ).  



   Avoid the use of Carisoprodol, Aspirin and Codeine Phosphate Tablets in adolescents 12 to 18 years of age who have other risk factors that may increase their sensitivity to the respiratory depressant effects of codeine.  



     Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome    



   Prolonged use of Carisoprodol, Aspirin and Codeine Phosphate Tablets during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life- threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available (see   WARNINGS  ).  



     Interactions With Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes    



   The effects of concomitant use or discontinuation of cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, 3A4 inhibitors, or 2D6 inhibitors with codeine are complex. Use of cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, 3A4 inhibitors, or 2D6 inhibitors with Carisoprodol, Aspirin and Codeine Phosphate Tablets requires careful consideration of the effects on  codeine, and the active metabolite, morphine. (See   WARNINGS  ,       PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions)      .  



     Risks From Concomitant Use With Benzodiazepines Or Other CNS Depressants   Concomitant use of opioids   with   benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death (see   WARNINGS  ,       PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions      ).  



 *  Reserve concomitant prescribing of Carisoprodol, Aspirin and Codeine Phosphate Tablets and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. 
 *  Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. 
 *  Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.

   Adrenal Insufficiency    



 Inform patients that opioids could cause adrenal insufficiency, a potentially life-threatening condition. Adrenal insufficiency may present with non-specific symptoms and signs such as nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. Advise patients to seek medical attention if they experience a constellation of these symptoms (see   WARNINGS    ).



   Important Administration Instructions    



 Instruct patients how to properly take Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets. (see   DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION    ).



 Patients should take the drug only for as long as it is prescribed, in the amounts prescribed, and no more frequently than prescribed.



   Hypotension    



 Inform patients that Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets may cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope. Instruct patients how to recognize symptoms of low blood pressure and how to reduce the risk of serious consequences should hypotension occur (e.g., sit or lie down, carefully rise from a sitting or lying position) (see   WARNINGS    ).



   Anaphylaxis    



 Inform patients that anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets. Advise patients how to recognize such a reaction and when to seek medical attention (see   CONTRAINDICATIONS    ,   ADVERSE REACTIONS    ).



 *      Aspirin Allergy  
 *     Patients should be informed that Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets contains aspirin and should not be taken by patients with an aspirin or NSAIDs allergy (see   WARNINGS   ). 
      Pregnancy    
 

 *      Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome  
 *     Inform female patients of reproductive potential that prolonged use of Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated (see   WARNINGS  ,  PRECAUTIONS; Pregnancy   ). 
 *      Embryo-Fetal Toxicity  
 *     Inform female patients of reproductive potential that Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets can (or may) cause fetal harm and to inform the healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy (see   PRECAUTIONS; Pregnancy   ). 
      Lactation    
 

 Advise women that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets (see   PRECAUTIONS; Nursing Mothers    ).



   Infertility    



 Inform patients that chronic use of opioids may cause reduced fertility. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible (see   PRECAUTIONS; Females and Males of Reproductive Potential    ).



   Risk of Bleeding    



 Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of bleeding. Tell patients to notify their physician if they are prescribed any drug which may increase risk of bleeding.



 Counsel patients who consume three or more alcoholic drinks daily about the bleeding risks involved with chronic, heavy alcohol use while taking aspirin (see   WARNINGS    ).



   Driving or Operating Heavy Machinery    



 Inform patients that Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets may impair the ability to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating heavy machinery. Advise patients not to perform such tasks until they know how they will react to the medication (see   WARNINGS    ).



   Constipation    



 Advise patients of the potential for severe constipation, including management instructions and when to seek medical attention (see   ADVERSE REACTIONS    ).



   Avoid Concomitant Use of NSAIDs    



 Inform patients that the concomitant use of Carisoprodol, Aspirin and Codeine Phosphate Tablets with NSAIDs or other salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) is not recommended due to the increased risk of gastrointestinal toxicity, and little or no increase in efficacy (see   WARNINGS  ,  PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions  )  . Alert patients that NSAIDs may be present in "over the counter" medications for treatment of colds, fever, or insomnia.



   Disposal of Unused Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets    



 Advise patients to properly dispose of unused Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets Advise patients to throw the drug in the household trash following these steps.



 *  1)  Remove them from their original containers and mix them with an undesirable substance, such as used coffee grounds or kitty litter (this makes the drug less appealing to children and pets, and unrecognizable to people who may intentionally go through the trash seeking drugs). 
 *  2)  Place the mixture in a sealable bag, empty can, or other container to prevent the drug from leaking or breaking out of a garbage bag, or to dispose of in accordance with the local state guidelines and/or regulations. 
      Carisoprodol Should Only be Used for Short-Term Treatment    
 

 Patients should be advised that treatment with carisoprodol should be limited to acute use (up to two or three weeks) for the relief of acute, musculoskeletal discomfort. In the post-marketing experience with carisoprodol, cases of dependence, withdrawal, and abuse have been reported with prolonged use. If musculoskeletal symptoms still persist, patients should contact their healthcare provider for further evaluation.



    Drug Interactions



     Table  2  includes clinically significant drug interactions with Carisoprodol, Aspirin and Codeine Phosphate Tablets.



  Table 2: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Carisoprodol, Aspirin and Codeine Phosphate Tablets.  




                             Inhibitors of CYP3A4     
                                                        
  Clinical Impact:           The concomitant use of Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets with CYP3A4 inhibitors may result in an increase in codeine plasma concentrations with subsequently greater metabolism by cytochrome CYP2D6, resulting in greater morphine levels, which could increase or prolong adverse reactions and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression, particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets is achieved (see WARNINGS).  After stopping a CYP3A4 inhibitor, as the effects of the inhibitor decline, it may result in lower codeine levels, greater norcodeine levels, and less metabolism via 2D6 with resultant lower morphine levels (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY; Pharmacokinetics), resulting in decreased opioid efficacy or a withdrawal syndrome in patients who had developed physical dependence to codeine.    
  Intervention:              If concomitant use with CYP3A4 inhibitor is necessary, consider dosage reduction of Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets until stable drug effects are achieved. Monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals.  If a CYP3A4 inhibitor is discontinued, consider increasing the Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets dosage until stable drug effects are achieved. Monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal.    
  Examples:                  Macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g. ketoconazole), protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir)    
  CYP3A4 Inducers            
  Clinical Impact:           The concomitant use of Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets and CYP3A4 inducers can result in lower codeine levels, greater norcodeine levels, and less metabolism via 2D6 with resultant lower morphine levels (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY; Pharmacokinetics), resulting in decreased efficacy or onset of a withdrawal syndrome in patients who have developed physical dependence (see WARNINGS).  After stopping a CYP3A4 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the codeine plasma concentration may increase with subsequently greater metabolism by cytochrome CYP2D6, resulting in greater morphine levels (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY; Pharmacokinetics), which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic effects and adverse reactions, and may cause serious respiratory depression.    
  Intervention:              If concomitant use of a CYP3A4 inducer is necessary, follow the patient for reduced efficacy and signs of opioid withdrawal and consider increasing the Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets dosage as needed.  If a CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued, consider Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets dosage reduction, and monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals.    
  Examples:                    Rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin 
      
                             Inhibitors of CYP2D6     
                                                        
  Clinical Impact:             Codeine in Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets is metabolized by CYP2D6 to form morphine. The concomitant use of Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets and CYP2D6 inhibitors can increase the plasma concentration of codeine, but can decrease the plasma concentrations of active metabolite morphine which could result in reduced analgesic efficacy or symptoms of opioid withdrawal, particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets is achieved (see   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY; Pharmacokinetics   ). 
    After stopping a CYP2D6 inhibitor, as the effects of the inhibitor decline, the codeine plasma concentration will decrease but the active metabolite morphine plasma concentration will increase, which could increase or prolong adverse reactions and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression (see   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY; Pharmacokinetics   ). 
      
  Intervention:                If concomitant use with a CYP2D6 inhibitor is necessary, or if a CYP2D6 inhibitor is discontinued after concomitant use, consider dosage adjustment of Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets and monitor patients closely at frequent intervals. 
    If concomitant use with CYP2D6 inhibitors is necessary, follow the patient for reduced efficacy or signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal and consider increasing the Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets as needed. 
    After stopping use of a CYP2D6 inhibitor, consider reducing the Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets and monitor the patient for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression or sedation. 
      
  Examples:                    Paroxetine, fluoxetine, bupropion, quinidine 
      
                             Benzodiazepines and other Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants  
                                                        
  Clinical Impact:             Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants including alcohol, increases the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death. 
      
  Intervention:                Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients closely for signs of respiratory depression and sedation (see   WARNINGS   ). 
      
  Examples:                    Benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol. 
      
  Serotonergic Drugs         
  Clinical Impact:           The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome.    
  Intervention:              If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected.    
  Examples:                  Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that effect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue).    
                             Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)  
                                                        
  Clinical Impact:           MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma) (see WARNINGS).    
  Intervention:              Do not use Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment.  If urgent use of an opioid is necessary, use test doses and frequent titration of small doses of other opioids (such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, oxymorphone, hydrocodone, or buprenorphine) to treat pain while closely monitoring blood pressure and signs and symptoms of CNS and respiratory depression.    
  Examples:                  Phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid    
  Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics    
  Clinical Impact:           May reduce the analgesic effect of Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.    
  Intervention:              Avoid concomitant use.    
  Examples:                  Butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, buprenorphine    
  Muscle Relaxants           
  Clinical Impact:           Codeine may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression.    
                            Intervention:             
                                                        Monitor patients for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected and decrease the dosage of Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary.    
  Diuretics                  
  Clinical Impact:           Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone.    
  Intervention:              Monitor patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed.  The effectiveness of diuretics in patients with underlying renal or cardiovascular disease may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to inhibition of renal prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal blood flow and salt and fluid retention.    
  Anticholinergic Drugs      
  Clinical Impact:           The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus.    
  Intervention:              Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets is used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs.    
  Anticoagulants             
  Clinical Impact:           Aspirin may enhance the effects of anticoagulants. Concurrent use may increase the risk of bleeding. Aspirin can also displace warfarin from protein binding sides, leading to prolongation of both the prothrombin time and the bleeding time.    
  Intervention:              Monitor patients for signs of bleeding.    
  Examples:                  Warfarin, heparin, enoxaparin, clopidogrel, prasugrel, rivaroxaban, apixaban    
  Uricosuric Agents          
  Clinical Impact:           Aspirin inhibits the uricosuric effects of uricosuric agents.    
  Intervention:              Avoid concomitant use.    
  Examples:                  Probenecid    
  Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors    
  Clinical Impact:           Concurrent use with aspirin can lead to high serum concentrations of the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and cause toxicity due to competition at the renal tubule for secretion.    
  Intervention:              Consider reducing the dose of the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and monitor patient for any adverse effects from the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor.    
  Examples:                  Acetazolamide, methazolamide    
  Methotrexate               
  Clinical Impact:           Aspirin may enhance the toxicity of methotrexate by displacing it from its plasma protein binding sites and/or reducing its renal clearance.    
  Intervention:              Use caution if using concomitantly, especially in elderly patients or patients with renal impairment. Monitor patients for methotrexate toxicity.    
  Nephrotoxic Agents         
  Clinical Impact:           Concomitant use with aspirin may lead to additive nephrotoxicity due to the inhibition of renal prostaglandins by aspirin. Also, the plasma concentration of aspirin is increased by conditions that reduce the glomerular filtration rate or tubular secretion.    
  Intervention:              Use Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets with caution if used concomitantly with nephrotoxic agents. Closely monitor the renal function of patients    
  Examples:                  Aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, systemic bacitracin, cisplatin, cyclosporine, foscarnet, or parenteral vancomycin    
  Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors    
  Clinical Impact:           The hyponatremic and hypotensive effects of ACE inhibitors may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to its indirect effect on the renin-angiotensin conversion pathway.    
  Intervention:              Use caution if using concomitantly. Monitor the blood pressure and renal function of patients.    
  Examples:                  Ramipril, captopril    
                             Beta Blockers            
                                                        
                            Clinical Impact:          
                                                          The hypotensive effects of beta blockers may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to inhibition of renal prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal blood flow, and salt and fluid retention. 
      
                            Intervention:             
                                                          Use caution if using concomitantly. Monitor the blood pressure and renal function of patients 
      
                            Examples:                 
                                                          Metoprolol, propranolol 
      
  Hypoglycemic Agents        
  Clinical Impact:             Aspirin may increase the serum glucose-lowering action of insulin and sulfonylureas leading to hypoglycemia. 
      
  Intervention:                Patients should be advised to consult a physician if any signs or symptoms of hypoglycemia occur. 
      
  Examples:                    Insulin, glimepiride, glipizide 
      
  Anticonvulsants            
  Clinical Impact:             Aspirin can displace protein-bound phenytoin and valproic acid, leading to a decrease in the total concentration of phenytoin and an increase in serum valproic acid levels. 
      
  Intervention:                Use caution if using concomitantly 
      
  Examples:                    Phenytoin, valproic acid 
      
  Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)    
  Clinical Impact:             Concurrent use with aspirin may increase the risk of bleeding or lead to decreased renal function. Aspirin may enhance serious side effects and toxicity of ketorolac by displacing it from its plasma protein binding sites and/or reducing its renal clearance. 
      
  Intervention:                Avoid concomitant use 
      
  Examples:                    Ketorolac, ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac 
      
  Corticosteroids            
  Clinical Impact:             In patients receiving concomitant corticosteroids and chronic use of aspirin, withdrawal of corticosteroids may result in salicylism because corticosteroids enhance renal clearance of salicylates and their withdrawal is followed by return to normal rates of renal clearance. 
      
  Intervention:                Avoid concomitant use 
      
           Drug/Drug Interactions With   Carisoprodol    
 

 The sedative effect of carisoprodol and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Therefore, caution should be exercised with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Concomitant use of carisoprodol and meprobamate, a metabolite of carisoprodol, is not recommended (see   WARNINGS     )  



 Carisoprodol is metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 to form meprobamate (see   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY    ).   Co-administration of CYP2C19 inhibitors, such as omeprazole or fluvoxamine, with carisoprodol could result in increased exposure of carisoprodol and decreased exposure of meprobamate. Co-administration of CYP2C19 inducers, such as rifampin or St. John's Wort, with carisoprodol could result in decreased exposure of carisoprodol and increased exposure of meprobamate. Low dose aspirin also showed an induction effect on CYP2C19. The full pharmacological impact of these potential alterations of exposures in terms of either efficacy or safety of carisoprodol is unknown.



  Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions  



   Aspirin    



 Aspirin may interfere with the following laboratory determinations in blood: serum amylase, fasting blood glucose, cholesterol, protein, serum glutamic-oxalacetic transaminase (SGOT), uric acid, prothrombin time and bleeding time. Aspirin may interfere with the following laboratory determinations in urine: glucose, 5-hydroxy-indoleacetic acid, Gerhardt ketone, vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), uric acid, diacetic acid, and spectrophotometric detection of barbiturates.



   Codeine    



 Codeine may increase serum amylase levels.



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility



    Caricinogenesis    



 Long term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets.



 Administration of aspirin for 68 weeks at 0.5 percent in the feed of rats was not carcinogenic.



 Two-year carcinogenicity studies with codeine sulfate have been conducted in F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenicity in male and female rats, respectively, at dietary doses up to 70 and 80 mg/kg/day of codeine sulfate (approximately 4 times the maximum recommended daily dose of 180 mg/day for adults on a mg/m  2  basis) for two years. Similarly there was no evidence of carcinogenicity activity in male and female mice at dietary doses up to 400 mg/kg/day of codeine sulfate (approximately 10 times the maximum recommended daily dose of 180 mg/day for adults on a mg/m  2  basis) for two years.



   Mutagenesis    



 Codeine was not mutagenic in the in vitro  bacterial reverse mutation assay or clastogenic in the in vitro  Chinese hamster ovary cell chromosome aberration assay.



 Aspirin is not mutagenic in the Ames Salmonella assay; however, aspirin did induce chromosome aberrations in cultured human fibroblasts



 Carisoprodol was not formally evaluated for genotoxicity. In published studies, carisoprodol was mutagenic in the in vitro  mouse lymphoma cell assay in the absence of metabolizing enzymes, but was not mutagenic in the presence of metabolizing enzymes. Carisoprodol was clastogenic in the in vitro  chromosomal aberration assay using Chinese hamster ovary cells with or without the presence of metabolizing enzymes. Other types of genotoxic tests resulted in negative findings. Carisoprodol was not mutagenic in the Ames reverse mutation assay using S. typhimurium  strains with or without metabolizing enzymes, and was not clastogenic in an in vitro  mouse micronucleus assay of circulating blood cells.



   Impairment of Fertility    



 No adequate studies have been conducted in animals to characterize the impact of the combinations of carisoprodol, aspirin, and codeine on fertility. There are also no data on codeine alone.



 Aspirin inhibits ovulation in rats.



 Carisoprodol was not formally evaluated for effects on fertility. Published reproductive studies of carisoprodol in mice found no alteration in fertility although an alteration in reproductive cycles characterized by a greater time spent in estrus was observed at a carisoprodol dose of 1200 mg/kg/day. In a 13-week toxicology study that did not determine fertility, mouse testes weight and sperm motility were reduced at a dose of 1200 mg/kg/day. In both studies, the no effect level was 750 mg/kg/day, corresponding to approximately 2.6 times the human equivalent dosage of 350 mg four times a day, based on a body surface area comparison.



 The significance of these findings for human fertility is not known.



    Pregnancy



    Pregnancy Category D    



  Risk Summary  



 Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy may cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome. Use of aspirin, including Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets, during the third trimester of pregnancy increases the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Avoid use of NSAIDs, including Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets, in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of gestation (third trimester).



 Available data with Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with the combination of carisoprodol, aspirin and caffeine, and codeine phosphate.



 In animal reproduction studies, codeine administration during organogenesis has been shown to produce delayed ossification in the offspring of mice at 2.8 times maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 180 mg/day, embryolethal and fetotoxic effects in the offspring of rats and hamsters at approximately 4 to 6 times the MRHD, and cranial malformations/ cranioschisis in the offspring of hamsters between 2 and 8 times the MRHD (see Data  ). Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as aspirin, resulted in increased pre- and postimplantation loss.



 Studies of aspirin use in pregnant women have not shown that aspirin increases the risk of abnormalities when administered during the first trimester of pregnancy. In controlled studies involving 41,337 pregnant women and their offspring, there was no evidence that aspirin taken during pregnancy caused stillbirth, neonatal death or reduced birth weight. In controlled studies of 50,282 pregnant women and their offspring, aspirin administration in moderate and heavy doses during the first four lunar months of pregnancy showed no teratogenic effect.



 Therapeutic doses of aspirin in pregnant women close to term may cause bleeding in mother, fetus, or neonate. During the last 6 months of pregnancy, regular use of aspirin in high doses may prolong pregnancy and delivery.



 There are no data on the use of carisoprodol during human pregnancy. Animal studies indicate that carisoprodol crosses the placenta and results in adverse effects on fetal growth and postnatal survival. The primary metabolite of carisoprodol, meprobamate, is an approved anxiolytic. Retrospective, post-marketing studies do not show a consistent association between maternal use of meprobamate and an increased risk for particular congenital malformations.



 Animal studies have not adequately evaluated the teratogenic effects of carisoprodol. There was no increase in the incidence of congenital malformations noted in the reproductive studies in rats, rabbits, and mice treated with meprobamate. Retrospective, post-marketing studies of meprobamate during human pregnancy were equivocal for demonstrating an increased risk of congenital malformations following the first trimester exposure. Across studies that indicated an increased risk, the types of malformations were inconsistent.



 In animal studies, carisoprodol reduced fetal weights, postnatal weight gain, and postnatal survival at maternal doses equivalent to 1 to 1.5 times the human dose (based on a body surface area comparison). Rats exposed to meprobamate in utero  showed behavioral alterations that persisted into adulthood. For children exposed to meprobamate in utero  , one study found no adverse effects on mental or motor development or IQ scores. Carisoprodol should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus.



 The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.



   Clinical Considerations    



  Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reaction  



 Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth.



 Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly (see   WARNINGS    ).



  Labor and Delivery  



 There are no studies on the effects of Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDS, including aspirin, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth.



 Opioids such as codeine cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho- physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression.



 Aspirin should be avoided one week prior to and during labor and delivery because it can result in excessive blood loss at delivery. Prolonged gestation and prolonged labor due to prostaglandin inhibition have been reported.



 Salicylates readily cross the placenta and by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis, may cause constriction of ductus arteriosus resulting in pulmonary hypertension and increased fetal mortality and, possibly other untoward fetal effects. Aspirin use in pregnancy can also result in alteration in maternal and neonatal hemostasis mechanisms. Maternal aspirin use during later stages of pregnancy may cause low birth weight, increased incidence of intracranial hemorrhage in premature infants, stillbirths and neonatal death. Use during pregnancy, especially in the third trimester, should be avoided.



 There is no information about the effects of carisoprodol on the mother and the fetus during labor and delivery.



  Data  



   Animal Data    



 Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with the combination of carisoprodol, aspirin, and codeine phosphate.



 *     Codeine  
 *     In a study in which pregnant hamsters were administered 150 mg/kg twice daily of codeine (oral; approximately 14 times the maximum recommended daily dose of 180 mg/day for adults on a mg/m  2  basis) during organogenesis cranial malformations (i.e., meningoencephalocele) in several fetuses were reported; as well as the observation of increases in the percentage of resorptions per litter. Doses of 50 and 150 mg/kg, bid resulted in fetotoxicity as demonstrated by decreased fetal body weight. In an earlier study in hamsters, single oral doses of 73 to 360 mg/kg level on Gestation Day 8 (oral; approximately 4 to 16 times the maximum recommended daily dose of 180 mg/day for adults on a mg/m  2  basis), reportedly produced cranioschisis in all of the fetuses examined. 
 *     In studies in rats, doses at the 120 mg/kg level (oral; approximately 6 times the maximum recommended daily dose of 180 mg/day for adults on a mg/m  2  basis) during organogenesis, in the toxic range for the adult animal, were associated with an increase in embryo resorption at the time of implantation. 
 *     In pregnant mice, a single 100 mg/kg dose (subcutaneous; approximately 2.8 times the recommended daily dose of 180 mg/day for adults on a mg/mg  2  basis) administered between Gestation Day 7 and 12 reportedly resulted in delayed ossification in the offspring. 
 *     No teratogenic effects were observed in rabbits administered up to 30 mg/kg (approximately 4 times the maximum recommended daily dose of 180 mg/day for adults on a mg/m  2  basis) of codeine during organogenesis. 
 *     Codeine (30 mg/kg) administered subcutaneously to pregnant rats during pregnancy and for 25 days after delivery increased neonatal mortality at birth. This dose is 1.6 times the maximum recommended human dose of 180 mg/day on a body surface area comparison. 
       Nursing Mothers
 

    Risk Summary    



 Codeine and its active metabolite, morphine, are present in human milk. There are published studies and cases that have reported excessive sedation, respiratory depression, and death (one case) in infants exposed to codeine via breast milk. Women who are ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine achieve higher than expected serum levels of morphine, potentially leading to higher levels of morphine in breast milk that can be dangerous in their breastfed infants. In women with normal codeine metabolism (normal CYP2D6 activity), the amount of codeine secreted into human milk is low and dose-dependent. There is no information on the effects of the codeine on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including excess sedation, respiratory depression, and death in a breastfed infant, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with Carisoprodol, Aspirin and Codeine Phosphate Tablets (see   WARNINGS  )  .



 The aspirin in Carisoprodol, Aspirin and Codeine Phosphate Tablets are also excreted in breast milk in small amounts. Adverse effects on platelet function in the nursing infant exposed to aspirin in breast milk may be a potential risk. Furthermore, nursing women are advised against aspirin use because of the possible development of Reye's Syndrome in their babies.



 Very limited data in humans show that carisoprodol is present in breast milk and may reach concentrations two to four times the maternal plasma concentrations. In one case report, a breastfed infant received about 4 to 6% of the maternal daily dose through breast milk and experienced no adverse effects. However, milk production was inadequate and the baby was supplemented with formula. In lactation studies in mice, female pup survival and pup weight at weaning were decreased. This information suggests that maternal use of carisoprodol may lead to reduced or less effective infant feeding (due to sedation) and/or decreased milk production. Caution should be exercised when carisoprodol is administered to a nursing woman.



   Clinical Consideration    



 If infants are exposed to Carisoprodol, Aspirin and Codeine Phosphate Tablets through breast milk, they should be monitored for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breastfeeding is stopped.



  Females and Males of Reproductive Potential  



   Infertility    



 Chronic use of opioids may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible (see   ADVERSE REACTIONS     ,  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  ,     PRECAUTIONS; Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility    ).



  Females  



 Based on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin-mediated NSAIDs, including aspirin, may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women. Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including aspirin, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility.



    Pediatric Use



  Preparations containing aspirin should be kept out of the reach of children. Reye's Syndrome is a rare condition that affects the brain and liver and is most often observed in children given aspirin during a viral illness. The efficacy and safety of Carisoprodol, Aspirin and Codeine Phosphate Tablets in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age have not been established.



 Life-threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received codeine (see   WARNINGS    ). In most of the reported cases, these events followed tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy, and many of the children had evidence of being ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine (i.e., multiple copies of the gene for cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2D6 or high morphine concentrations). Children with sleep apnea may be particularly sensitive to the respiratory depressant effects of codeine.



 Because of the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression and death:



 *    Carisoprodol, Aspirin and Codeine Phosphate Tablets are contraindicated for all children younger than 12 years of age (see   CONTRAINDICATIONS   ). 
 *    Carisoprodol, Aspirin and Codeine Phosphate Tablets are contraindicated for post-operative management in pediatric patients younger than 18 years of age following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy (see   CONTRAINDICATIONS   ). 
 *    Avoid the use of Carisoprodol, Aspirin and Codeine Phosphate Tablets in adolescents 12 to 18 years of age who have other risk factors that may increase their sensitivity to the respiratory depressant effects of codeine unless the benefits outweigh the risks. Risk factors include conditions associated with hypoventilation, such as postoperative status, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, severe pulmonary disease, neuromuscular disease, concomitant use of other medications that cause respiratory depression (see   WARNINGS   ). 
       Geriatric Use
 

  Clinical studies of Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.



 Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.



 Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets slowly in geriatric patients and monitor closely for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression (see   WARNINGS    ).



 Components of this product are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.



 Elderly patients, compared to younger patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions. If the anticipated benefit for the elderly patient outweighs these potential risks, dose selection should start at the low end of the dosing range, and monitor patients for adverse effects (see   WARNINGS    ).



  Hepatic Impairment  



 No formal studies have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment so the pharmacokinetics of aspirin, codeine and in this patient population are unknown. Start these patients cautiously with lower doses of Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets or with longer dosing intervals and titrate slowly while carefully monitoring for side effects. In patients with severe hepatic disease, monitor effects of therapy with serial liver function tests.



 Since carisoprodol is excreted by the kidney and is metabolized in the liver, caution should be exercised if carisoprodol is administered to patients with impaired hepatic function. Carisoprodol is dialyzable by hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.



  Renal Impairment  



 Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets contains aspirin, which should be avoided in patients with severe renal failure (glomerular filtration rate less than 10 mL/minute).



 Codeine pharmacokinetics may be altered in patients with renal failure. Clearance may be decreased and the metabolites may accumulate to much higher plasma levels in patients with renal failure as compared to patients with normal renal function. Start these patients cautiously with lower doses of Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets or with longer dosing intervals and titrate slowly while carefully monitoring for side effects. In patients with renal disease, monitor effects of therapy with serial renal function tests.



  Since carisoprodol is excreted by the kidney and is metabolized in the liver, caution should be exercised if carisoprodol is administered to patients with impaired renal function. Carisoprodol is dialyzable by hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.

    <Section id="S4" name="warnings">    WARNINGS



   Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse



  Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets contains codeine and carisoprodol. Codeine in combination with carisoprodol and aspirin is a Schedule III controlled substance. As Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets contains carisoprodol and codeine, it exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse (see   DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE    ).



 Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused.



 Assess each patient's risk for addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets, and monitor all patients receiving Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient.



 Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse.



 Opioids and carisoprodol are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug (see   PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients    ). Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.



  Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)  



 To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to do all of the following:



 *    Complete a  REMS-compliant education program  offered by an accredited provider of continuing education (CE) or another education program that includes all the elements of the FDA Education Blueprint for Health Care Providers Involved in the Management or Support of Patients with Pain. 
 *    Discuss the safe use, serious risks, and proper storage and disposal of opioid analgesics with patients and/or their caregivers every time these medicines are prescribed. The Patient Counseling Guide (PCG) can be obtained at this link:  www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSPCG  . 
 *    Emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide that they will receive from their pharmacist every time an opioid analgesic is dispensed to them. 
 *    Consider using other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety, such as patient-prescriber agreements that reinforce patient-prescriber responsibilities. 
    To obtain further information on the opioid analgesic REMS and for a list of accredited REMS CME/CE, call 800-503-0784, or log on to  www.opioidanalgesicrems.com  . The FDA Blueprint can be found at  www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSBlueprint  .
 

  Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression  



 Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status (see   OVERDOSAGE    ). Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.



 While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24 to 72 hours of initiating therapy with and following dosage increases of Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets.



 To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets are essential (see   DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION    ).



 Overestimating the Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose.



 Accidental ingestion of Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of codeine and carisoprodol.



    Ultra-Rapid Metabolism of Codeine and Other Risk Factors for Life-threatening Respiratory Depression in Children



  Life-threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received codeine. Codeine is subject to variability in metabolism based upon CYP2D6 genotype (described below), which can lead to an increased exposure to the active metabolite morphine. Based upon post-marketing reports, children less than 12 years old appear to be more susceptible to the respiratory depressant effects of codeine, particularly if there are risk factors for respiratory depression. For example, many reported cases of death occurred in the post-operative period following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy, and many of the children had evidence of being ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine. Furthermore, children with obstructive sleep apnea who are treated with codeine for post-tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy pain may be particularly sensitive to its respiratory depressant effect. Because of the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression and death:



 *    Carisoprodol, Aspirin and Codeine Phosphate Tablets are contraindicated for all children younger than 12 years of age (see   CONTRAINDICATIONS   ). 
 *    Carisoprodol, Aspirin and Codeine Phosphate Tablets are contraindicated for post- operative management in pediatric patients younger than 18 years of age following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy (see   CONTRAINDICATIONS   ). 
 *    Avoid the use of Carisoprodol, Aspirin and Codeine Phosphate Tablets in adolescents 12 to 18 years of age who have other risk factors that may increase their sensitivity to the respiratory depressant effects of codeine unless the benefits outweigh the risks. Risk factors include conditions associated with hypoventilation, such as postoperative status, obstructive sleep apnea, severe pulmonary disease, neuromuscular disease, and concomitant use of other medications that cause respiratory depression. 
 *    As with adults, when prescribing codeine for adolescents, healthcare providers should choose the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time and inform patients and caregivers about these risks and the signs of morphine overdose (see   PRECAUTIONS; Pediatric Use  ,  OVERDOSAGE   ). 
        Nursing Mothers  
 

  At least one death was reported in a nursing infant who was exposed to high levels of morphine in breast milk because the mother was an ultra-rapid metabolizer of codeine. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with Carisoprodol, Aspirin and Codeine Phosphate Tablets (see   PRECAUTIONS; Nursing Mothers    ).



   CYP2D6 Genetic Variability: Ultra-rapid metabolizer    



 Some individuals may be ultra-rapid metabolizers because of a specific CYP2D6 genotype (gene duplications denoted as *1/*1xN or *1/*2xN). The prevalence of this CYP2D6 phenotype varies widely and has been estimated at 1 to 10% for Whites (European, North Americans), 3 to 4% for Blacks (African Americans), 1 to 2% for East Asians (Chinese, Japanese, Korean), and may be greater than 10% in certain ethnic groups (i.e., Oceanian, North African, Middle Eastern, Ashkenazi Jews, Puerto Rican). These individuals convert codeine into its active metabolite, morphine, more rapidly and completely than other people. This rapid conversion results in higher than expected serum morphine levels. Even at labeled dosage regimens, individuals who are ultra-rapid metabolizers may have life-threatening or fatal respiratory depression or experience signs of overdose (such as extreme sleepiness, confusion, or shallow breathing) (see   OVERDOSAGE    ). Therefore, individuals who are ultra-rapid metabolizers should not use codeine.



   Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome    



 Prolonged use of Carisoprodol, Aspirin and Codeine Phosphate Tablets during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available (see   PRECAUTIONS; Pregnancy, Information for Patients    ).



   Risks of Interactions With Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes    



 The effects of concomitant use or discontinuation of cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, 3A4 inhibitors, or 2D6 inhibitors with codeine are complex. Use of cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, 3A4 inhibitors, or 2D6 inhibitors with Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets requires careful consideration of the effects on codeine and the active metabolite, morphine.



 *     Cytochrome P450 3A4 Interaction  
 *     The concomitant use of Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets with all cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole- antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir) or discontinuation of a cytochrome P450 3A4 inducer such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may result in an increase in codeine plasma concentrations with subsequently greater metabolism by cytochrome P450 2D6, resulting in greater morphine levels, which could increase or prolong adverse reactions and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. 
 *     The concomitant use of Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets with all cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers or discontinuation of a cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitor may result in lower codeine levels, greater norcodeine levels, and less metabolism via 2D6 with resultant lower morphine levels. This may be associated with a decrease in efficacy, and in some patients, may result in signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal. 
 *     Follow patients receiving Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets and any CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer for signs and symptoms that may reflect opioid toxicity and opioid withdrawal when Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets is used in conjunction with inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4. 
 *     If concomitant use of a CYP3A4 inhibitor is necessary or if a CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued, consider dosage reduction of Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets until stable drug effects are achieved. Monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals. 
 *     If concomitant use of a CYP3A4 inducer is necessary or if a CYP3A4 inhibitor is discontinued, consider increasing the Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets dosage until stable drug effects are achieved. Monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal. (see   PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions   ) .  
 *     Risks of Concomitant Use or Discontinuation of Cytochrome P450 2D6 Inhibitors  
 *     The concomitant use of Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets with all cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibitors (e.g., amiodarone, quinidine) may result in an increase in codeine plasma concentrations and a decrease in active metabolite morphine plasma concentration which could result in an analgesic efficacy reduction or symptoms of opioid withdrawal. 
 *     Discontinuation of a concomitantly used cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibitor may result in a decrease in codeine plasma concentration and an increase in active metabolite morphine plasma concentration which could increase or prolong adverse reactions and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. 
 *     Follow patients receiving Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets and any CYP2D6 inhibitor for signs and symptoms that may reflect opioid toxicity and opioid withdrawal when Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets are used in conjunction with inhibitors of CYP2D6. 
 *     If concomitant use with a CYP2D6 inhibitor is necessary, follow the patient for signs of reduced efficacy or opioid withdrawal and consider increasing the Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets dosage. After stopping use of a CYP2D6 inhibitor, consider reducing the Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets dosage and follow the patient for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression or sedation (see   PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions   ). 
      Risks from Concomitant Use With Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants    
 

 Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.



 Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics (see   PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions    ).



 If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.



 Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs (see   PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions  ,  Information for Patients    ).



   Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients With Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients    



 The use of Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated.



 Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease: Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets (see   WARNINGS    ).



 Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients (see   WARNINGS    ).



 Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets and when Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets are given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration (see   WARNINGS    ). Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients.



   Interaction With Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors    



 Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) may potentiate the effects of morphine, codeine's active metabolite, including respiratory depression, coma, and confusion. Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets should not be used in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment.



   Adrenal Insufficiency    



 Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.



   Severe Hypotension    



 Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) (see   PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions    ). Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets. In patients with circulatory shock, Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets in patients with circulatory shock.



   Risks of Use in Patients With Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness    



 In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets.



 Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets in patients with impaired consciousness or coma.



   Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions Including Peptic Ulcer Disease    



 Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus.



 The codeine in Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsening symptoms.



 Patients with a history of active peptic ulcer disease should avoid using aspirin, which can cause gastric mucosal irritation and bleeding.



 Aspirin can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse reactions including bleeding, perforation, and obstruction of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. Aspirin-associated serious GI adverse reactions can occur anywhere along the GI tract, at any time, with or without warning symptoms. Patients at higher risk of aspirin-associated serious upper GI adverse reactions include patients with a history of aspirin-associated GI bleeding from ulcers (complicated ulcers), a history of aspirin-associated ulcers (uncomplicated ulcers), geriatric patients, patients with poor baseline health status, patients taking higher doses of aspirin, and patients taking concomitant anticoagulants, NSAIDs, and/or large amounts of alcohol. To minimize the risk for aspirin-associated GI serious adverse reactions, the lowest effective aspirin dose should be used for the shortest possible duration.



   Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients With Seizure Disorders    



 The codeine in Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets therapy.



 There have been post-marketing reports of seizures in patients who received carisoprodol. Most of these cases have occurred in the setting of multiple drug overdoses (including drugs of abuse, illegal drugs, and alcohol) (see   OVERDOSAGE    ).



   Withdrawal    



 Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.



 When discontinuing Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets in a physically- dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage (see   DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION    ). Do not abruptly discontinue Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets in these patients (see   DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE    ).



   Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery    



 Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of Carisoprodol, Aspirin, and Codeine Phosphate Tablets and know how they will react to the medication.



   Coagulation Abnormalities and Bleeding Risks    



 Even low doses of aspirin can inhibit platelet function leading to an increase in bleeding time. This can adversely affect patients with inherited (i.e. hemophilia) or acquired (i.e. liver disease or vitamin K deficiency) bleeding disorders. Aspirin is contraindicated in patients with hemophilia.



 Aspirin administered pre-operatively may prolong the bleeding time.



 Patients who consume three or more alcoholic drinks every day should be counseled about the bleeding risks involved with chronic, heavy alcohol use while taking aspirin.



   Reye's Syndrome    



 Aspirin should not be used in children or teenagers for viral infections, with or without fever, because of the risk of Reye syndrome with concomitant use of aspirin in certain viral illnesses.



   Allergy    



 Aspirin is contraindicated in patients with known allergy to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug products (NSAIDs) and in patients with the syndrome of asthma, rhinitis, and nasal polyps. Aspirin may cause severe urticaria, angioedema, or bronchospasm (asthma).
