  6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The data in this section are derived from pooled data from the controlled period of the 2 comparator-controlled trials as well as data from the extension phase of one of these trials [see Clinical Studies (14)]. There were 410 patients exposed to BYDUREON BCISE 2 mg for 28 weeks during the controlled phases, and an additional 116 patients exposed to BYDUREON BCISE 2 mg during an uncontrolled extension for an additional 24 weeks. Overall, there were 526 patients exposed to BYDUREON BCISE 2 mg with a mean duration of exposure of 35 weeks in the controlled and extension phases of the two trials. Across the treatment arms in the controlled periods, the mean age of patients was 55 years, 2% were 75 years or older and 59% were male. The population in these studies was 78% White, 15% Black or African American, 5% Asian; 1% American Indian or Alaska Native; &lt;1 % were Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander; and &lt;1% were other races. This population included 42% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. At baseline, the population had diabetes for an average of 8.3 years and had a mean HbA1c of 8.5%. Baseline estimated renal function was normal or mildly impaired (eGFR &gt;=60mL/min/1.73 m2) in 93% of the pooled study populations.



   Common Adverse Reactions  



 Table 1 summarizes the adverse reactions with an incidence &gt;=5% occurring in BYDUREON BCISE-treated patients in the pooled data from the controlled and extension phases, including 10 weeks of follow-up, of the two comparator-controlled 28-week clinical trials. Adverse reactions were identified based on known adverse reactions associated with BYDUREON.



 Table 1: Adverse Reactions Reported in &gt;=5% of BYDUREON BCISE-Treated Patients from Pooled Clinical Trial Data in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 
                     BYDUREON  BCISE  2 mg  N = 526  %    
  Injection site nodule    10.5                 
  Nausea             8.2                  
  Note: Percentages are based on the number of patients who were randomized and received at least one dose of BYDUREON BCISE.    
         Nausea was a common adverse reaction associated with initiation of treatment with BYDUREON BCISE and usually decreased over time with continued use. The incidence of nausea and/or vomiting was 2% in the first week of therapy compared to 1% in the 4th week of therapy.
 

   Less Common Adverse Reactions  



 Adverse reactions that occurred in &gt;2% and &lt;5% of patients receiving BYDUREON BCISE during the controlled and extension phases, including 10 weeks of follow-up, of the two comparator-controlled 28-week clinical trials include: headache (4.4%), diarrhea (4.0%), vomiting (3.4%), injection site pruritus (3.2%), dizziness (2.5%), injection site erythema (2.3%), and constipation (2.1%).



   Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation of Therapy  



 The incidence of discontinuation of therapy due to adverse reactions was 3.9% for BYDUREON BCISE-treated patients in the two comparator-controlled 28-week trials. The most common classes of adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of therapy for BYDUREON BCISE-treated patients were Gastrointestinal Disorders 2.0% and General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions 1.2%. For BYDUREON BCISE-treated patients, the most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of therapy within each of these respective classes were diarrhea (0.7%), nausea (0.7%), vomiting (0.5%) and injection-site nodule (0.5%).



   Other Adverse Reactions  



   Hypoglycemia  



 Table 2 summarizes the incidence of glucose level &lt;54 mg/dL regardless of hypoglycemia clinical symptoms and the incidence of severe hypoglycemia in the two comparator-controlled 28-week trials of BYDUREON BCISE.

  Note: N and percentages are based on the number of patients who were randomized and received at least one dose of BYDUREON BCISE.    
        Severe hypoglycemia was defined as clinical symptoms that were considered to result from hypoglycemia in which the patient required the assistance of another person and associated with recovery after oral carbohydrates, intravenous glucose or glucagon administration if no plasma glucose was available.
 

   Injection-Site Adverse Reactions  



 In the two comparator-controlled 28-week trials, injection site reactions (including injection site nodule, injection site pruritus, injection site bruising) were observed in 23.9% of patients treated with BYDUREON BCISE. The formation of subcutaneous nodules is consistent with the properties of the microspheres used in BYDUREON BCISE.



   Increase in Heart Rate  



 In clinical trials of BYDUREON BCISE the mean increase from baseline in heart rate was 2.4 beats per minute. The long-term effects of the increase in heart rate have not been established.



   6.2 Immunogenicity

  As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to exenatide in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading.



 Anti-exenatide antibodies were measured at prespecified intervals in 393 BYDUREON BCISE-treated patients in the two comparator-controlled studies. In these trials 42.2% of these patients developed low titer antibodies to exenatide and approximately 31.8% of patients developed high titer antibodies at any time during the studies. The percentage of patients with positive antibody titers, in particular high titers, peaked at approximately weeks 8-16 of dosing and then diminished over time.



 Change in HbA1c from baseline in patients with low titer antibodies at the last visit was generally comparable to that observed in antibody-negative patients at the last visit. However, patients with higher titer antibodies may have an attenuated HbA1c response.



 Amongst BYDUREON BCISE-treated patients evaluable for antibodies (N=393), the incidence of potentially immunogenic injection site reactions (most commonly injection site nodule) during the 28-week studies was approximately 19.6%. These reactions were less commonly observed in antibody-negative patients (15.7%) and patients with low titer antibodies (16.3%) compared with those with high titer antibodies (27.2%).



 A total of 246 patients with antibodies to exenatide in the BYETTA and BYDUREON clinical trials were tested for the presence of cross-reactive antibodies to GLP-1 and/or glucagon. No treatment-emergent cross-reactive antibodies were observed across the range of titers.



   6.3 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of other formulations of exenatide. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Allergy/Hypersensitivity:  injection-site reactions, generalized pruritus and/or urticaria, macular or papular rash, angioedema; anaphylactic reaction.



   Drug Interactions:  increased international normalized ratio (INR) sometimes associated with bleeding, with concomitant warfarin  [see  Drug Interactions (7)  ]  .



   Gastrointestinal:  nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea resulting in dehydration; abdominal distension, abdominal pain, eructation, constipation, flatulence, acute pancreatitis, hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis sometimes resulting in death  [see  Indications and Usage (1)  ]  .



   Neurologic:  dysgeusia; somnolence



   Renal and Urinary Disorders:  altered renal function, including increased serum creatinine, renal impairment, worsened chronic renal failure or acute renal failure (sometimes requiring hemodialysis), kidney transplant and kidney transplant dysfunction.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: RISK OF THYROID C-CELL TUMORS 

  WARNING: RISK OF THYROID C-CELL TUMORS 

    *  Exenatide extended-release causes an increased incidence in thyroid C-cell tumors at clinically relevant exposures in rats compared to controls. It is unknown whether BYDUREON BCISE causes thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans, as the human relevance of exenatide extended-release-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 
 *  BYDUREON BCISE is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC and in patients with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2). Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of BYDUREON BCISE and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness). Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for detection of MTC in patients treated with BYDUREON BCISE [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

   5.1 Risk of Thyroid C-cell Tumors



  In both genders of rats, exenatide extended-release caused a dose-related and treatment-duration-dependent increase in the incidence of thyroid C-cell tumors (adenomas and/or carcinomas) at clinically relevant exposures compared to controls [see  Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)  ]  . A statistically significant increase in malignant thyroid C-cell carcinomas was observed in female rats receiving exenatide extended-release at 27-times clinical exposure compared to controls and higher incidences were noted in males above controls in all treated groups at &gt;=2-times clinical exposure. The potential of exenatide extended-release to induce C-cell tumors in mice has not been evaluated. Other GLP-1 receptor agonists have also induced thyroid C-cell adenomas and carcinomas in male and female mice and rats at clinically relevant exposures. It is unknown whether BYDUREON BCISE will cause thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans as the human relevance of exenatide extended-release-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined.



 Cases of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide, another GLP-1 receptor agonist, have been reported in the postmarketing period; the data in these reports are insufficient to establish or exclude a causal relationship between MTC and GLP-1 receptor agonist use in humans.



 BYDUREON BCISE is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with MEN 2. Counsel patients regarding the potential risk of MTC with the use of BYDUREON BCISE and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness).



 Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with BYDUREON BCISE. Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures, due to the low specificity of serum calcitonin testing for MTC and a high background incidence of thyroid disease. Significantly elevated serum calcitonin may indicate MTC and patients with MTC usually have values &gt;50 ng/L. If serum calcitonin is measured and found to be elevated, the patient should be further evaluated. Patients with thyroid nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging should also be further evaluated.



    5.2 Acute Pancreatitis



  Based on postmarketing data, exenatide has been associated with acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis. After initiation of BYDUREON BCISE, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis (including persistent severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back, which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting). If pancreatitis is suspected, BYDUREON BCISE should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated. If pancreatitis is confirmed, BYDUREON BCISE should not be restarted. Consider antidiabetic therapies other than BYDUREON BCISE in patients with a history of pancreatitis. In clinical trials of BYDUREON BCISE acute pancreatitis occurred in 0.4% of patients.



    5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin Secretagogues or Insulin



  The risk of hypoglycemia is increased when BYDUREON BCISE is used in combination with insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylureas) or insulin. Patients may require a lower dose of the secretagogue or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia in this setting [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



    5.4 Acute Kidney Injury and Impairment of Renal Function



  There have been postmarketing reports of altered renal function with exenatide, including increased serum creatinine, renal impairment, worsened chronic renal failure and acute renal failure, sometimes requiring hemodialysis or kidney transplantation. Some of these events occurred in patients receiving one or more pharmacologic agents known to affect renal function or hydration status such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or diuretics. Some events occurred in patients who had been experiencing nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, with or without dehydration. Reversibility of altered renal function has been observed in many cases with supportive treatment and discontinuation of potentially causative agents, including exenatide. Exenatide has not been found to be directly nephrotoxic in preclinical or clinical studies.



 BYDUREON BCISE is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance (CrCL) &lt;30 mL/min, eGFR &lt;30 mL/min/1.73m  2  ) or end-stage renal disease and should be used with caution in patients with renal transplantation [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.6)  and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  . Because BYDUREON BCISE may induce nausea and vomiting with transient hypovolemia, treatment may worsen renal function. Use BYDUREON BCISE with caution in patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCL 30-59 mL/min, eGFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73m  2  ) [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.6)  and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  . BYDUREON BCISE has not been studied in patients with end-stage renal disease or severe renal impairment.



    5.5 Gastrointestinal Disease



  Exenatide has not been studied in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease, including gastroparesis. Because exenatide is commonly associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, the use of BYDUREON BCISE is not recommended in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease.



    5.6 Immunogenicity



  Patients may develop antibodies to exenatide following treatment with BYDUREON BCISE. Anti-exenatide antibodies were measured in BYDUREON BCISE-treated patients in two comparator-controlled 28-week studies of BYDUREON BCISE. Patients with higher titer antibodies may have an attenuated HbA1c response. If there is worsening glycemic control or failure to achieve targeted glycemic control, consider alternative antidiabetic therapy [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ]  .



    5.7 Hypersensitivity



  There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis and angioedema) in patients treated with exenatide. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, the patient should discontinue BYDUREON BCISE and promptly seek medical advice [see  Contraindications (4)  and     Adverse Reactions (6.3)     ]  . Inform and closely monitor patients with a history of anaphylaxis or angioedema with another GLP-1 receptor agonist for allergic reactions, because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to anaphylaxis with BYDUREON BCISE.



    5.8 Injection-Site Reactions



  There have been postmarketing reports of serious injection-site reactions (e.g., abscess, cellulitis, and necrosis), with or without subcutaneous nodules, with the use of BYDUREON [see  Adverse Reactions (6.3)  ]  . Isolated cases required surgical intervention.



    5.9 Macrovascular Outcomes



  There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with exenatide.
