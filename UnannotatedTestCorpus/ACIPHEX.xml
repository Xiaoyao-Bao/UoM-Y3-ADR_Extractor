    6.1    Clinical    Studies    Experience  

  Because clinical trials are conducted under varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



   Adults  



 The data described below reflect exposure to ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets in 1064 adult patients exposed for up to 8 weeks.  The studies were primarily placebo- and active-controlled trials in adult     patients with     Erosive or Ulcerative Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD), Duodenal Ulcers and Gastric Ulcers.  The population had a mean age of 53 years (range 18-89 years) and had a ratio of approximately 60% male: 40% female.  The racial distribution was 86% Caucasian, 8% African American, 2% Asian, and 5% other.  Most patients received either 10 mg, 20 mg or 40 mg per day of ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets. 



 An analysis of adverse reactions appearing in &gt;=2% of patients treated with ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets (n=1064) and with a greater frequency than placebo (n=89) in controlled North American and European acute treatment trials, revealed the following adverse reactions:  pain (3% vs. 1%), pharyngitis (3% vs. 2%), flatulence (3% vs. 1%), infection (2% vs. 1%), and constipation (2% vs. 1%). 



 Three long-term maintenance studies consisted of a total of 740 adult patients; at least 54% of adult patients were exposed to ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets for 6 months and at least 33% were exposed for 12 months.  Of the 740 adult patients, 247 (33%) and 241 (33%) patients received 10 mg and 20 mg of ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets, respectively, while 169 (23%) patients received placebo and 83 (11%) received omeprazole.



 The safety profile of rabeprazole in the maintenance studies in adults was consistent with what was observed in the acute studies.



 Less common adverse reactions seen in controlled clinical trials (&lt;2% of patients treated with ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets and greater than placebo) and for which there is a possibility of a causal relationship to rabeprazole, include the following:  headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dry mouth, dizziness, peripheral edema, hepatic enzyme increase, hepatitis, hepatic encephalopathy, myalgia, and arthralgia.



   Combination Treatment with Amoxicillin and Clarithromycin:    In clinical trials using combination therapy with rabeprazole plus amoxicillin and clarithromycin (RAC), no adverse reactions unique to this drug combination were observed.  In the U.S. multicenter study, the most frequently reported drug related adverse reactions for patients who received RAC therapy for 7 or 10 days were diarrhea (8% and 7%) and taste perversion (6% and 10%), respectively.



 No clinically significant laboratory abnormalities particular to the drug combinations were observed.



 For more information on adverse reactions or laboratory changes with amoxicillin or clarithromycin, refer to their respective prescribing information,   Adverse Reactions   section.



   Pediatric    s  



 In a multicenter, open-label study of adolescent patients 12 to 16 years of age with a clinical diagnosis of symptomatic GERD or endoscopically proven GERD, the adverse event profile was similar to that of adults.  The adverse reactions reported without regard to relationship to ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets that occurred in &gt;=2% of 111 patients were headache (9.9%), diarrhea (4.5%), nausea (4.5%), vomiting (3.6%), and abdominal pain (3.6%).  The related reported adverse reactions that occurred in &gt;=2% of patients were headache (5.4%) and nausea (1.8%).  There were no adverse reactions reported in this study that were not previously observed in adults.



     6.2    Postmarketing Experience  

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of rabeprazole.  Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure:  



   Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders:   agranulocytosis, hemolytic anemia, leukopenia, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia  Ear and Labyrinth Disorders:  vertigo  Eye Disorders:       blurred vision  Gastrointestinal Disorders:  fundic gland polyps  General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions:  sudden death  Hepatobiliary Disorders:   jaundice  Immune System Disorders:   anaphylaxis, angioedema, systemic lupus erythematosus, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis (some fatal)  Infections and Infestations:     Clostridium difficile  -associated diarrhea  Investigations:  Increases in prothrombin time/INR (in patients treated with concomitant warfarin), TSH elevations  Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders:   hyperammonemia, hypomagnesemia  Musculoskeletal System Disorders:   bone fracture, rhabdomyolysis   Nervous System Disorders:       coma       Psychiatric Disorders:   delirium, disorientation   Renal and Urinary Disorders:    interstitial nephritis     Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders:   interstitial pneumonia  Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders:       severe dermatologic reactions including bullous and other drug eruptions of the skin, cutaneous lupus erythematosus, erythema multiforme

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">     5   WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  



   EXCERPT:    *   Gastric Malignancy :  In adults, symptomatic response to therapy with rabeprazole does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Consider additional follow-up and diagnostic testing (  5.1  ). 
 *   Use with  Warfarin :  Monitor for increases in INR and prothrombin time (  5.2  ,  7  ). 
 *   Acute  Interstitial Nephritis : Observed in patients taking PPIs (  5.3  ). 
 *   Clostridium  difficile  -  Associated Diarrhea :  PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk of (  5.4  ). 
 *   Bone  Fracture :  Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine (  5.5  ). 
 *   Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus : Mostly cutaneous, new onset or exacerbation of existing disease; discontinue ACIPHEX and refer to specialist for evaluation (  5.6  ). 
 *   Cyanocobalamin (  V  itamin B-12) Deficiency :  Daily long-term use (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption or a deficiency of cyanocobalamin (  5.7  ). 
 *   Hypomagnesemia :  Reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs (  5.8  ). 
 *   Interaction with Methotrexate : Concomitant use with PPIs may elevate and/or prolong serum concentrations of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to toxicity. With high dose methotrexate administration, consider a temporary withdrawal of ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets (  5.9  ,  7  ). 
 *   Fundic Gland Polyps : Risk increases with long-term use, especially beyond one year. Use the shortest duration of therapy (  5.10  ). 
    
 

    5.1   Presence of   G   astric   M   alignancy  



  In adults, symptomatic response to therapy with ACIPHEX does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Consider additional follow-up and diagnostic testing in adult patients who have a suboptimal response or an early symptomatic relapse after completing treatment with a PPI.



     5.2   Interaction   with   W   arfarin  



  Steady state interactions of rabeprazole and warfarin have not been adequately evaluated in patients.  There have been reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving a proton pump inhibitor and warfarin concomitantly.  Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death.  Patients treated with ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets and warfarin concomitantly may need to be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time  [see     Drug Interactions (7)     ]  .



     5.3   Acute Interstitial Nephritis  



  Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs including ACIPHEX.  Acute interstitial nephritis may occur at any point during PPI therapy and is generally attributed to an idiopathic hypersensitivity reaction.  Discontinue ACIPHEX if acute interstitial nephritis develops [   see     Contraindications (4)     ]   .  



     5.   4       Clostridium   difficile   -   A   ssociated   D   iarrhea  



  Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like ACIPHEX may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium   difficile  -associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients.  This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [   see     Adverse Reactions (6.2)     ]  .



 Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated.



  Clostridium   difficile   -  associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents.  For more information specific to antibacterial agents (clarithromycin and amoxicillin) indicated for use in combination with ACIPHEX, refer to    Warnings and Precautions     sections of the corresponding prescribing information.



     5.   5       Bone Fracture  



  Several published observational studies in adults suggest that PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine.  The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer).  Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated.  Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [   see      Dosage and Administration (2)     ,      Adverse Reactions (6.2)     ]  .



     5.6       Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus  



  Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been reported in patients taking PPIs, including rabeprazole. These events have occurred as both new onset and an exacerbation of existing autoimmune disease. The majority of PPI-induced lupus erythematosus cases were CLE.



 The most common form of CLE reported in patients treated with PPIs was subacute CLE (SCLE) and occurred within weeks to years after continuous drug therapy in patients ranging from infants to the elderly. Generally, histological findings were observed without organ involvement.



 Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is less commonly reported than CLE in patients receiving PPIs. PPI associated SLE is usually milder than non-drug induced SLE. Onset of SLE typically occurred within days to years after initiating treatment primarily in patients ranging from young adults to the elderly. The majority of patients presented with rash; however, arthralgia and cytopenia were also reported.



 Avoid administration of PPIs for longer than medically indicated. If signs or symptoms consistent with CLE or SLE are noted in patients receiving ACIPHEX, discontinue the drug and refer the patient to the appropriate specialist for evaluation. Most patients improve with discontinuation of the PPI alone in 4 to 12 weeks. Serological testing (e.g. ANA) may be positive and elevated serological test results may take longer to resolve than clinical manifestations.



     5.7 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency  



  Daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed in patients treated with ACIPHEX.



     5.8 Hypomagnesemia  



  Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI.



 For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), healthcare professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see     Adverse Reactions (6.2)     ]  .



     5.   9       Interaction   with Methotrexate  



  Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information  ) may elevate and prolong serum concentrations of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities.  In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [   see     Drug Interactions (7)     ]  .



     5   .10   Fundic Gland Polyps  



   PPI use is associated with an increased risk of fundic gland polyps that increases with long-term use, especially beyond one year. Most PPI users who developed fundic gland polyps were asymptomatic and fundic gland polyps were identified incidentally on endoscopy. Use the shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated.
