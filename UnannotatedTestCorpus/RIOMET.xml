  6.1 Clinical Studies Experience

    *  1.  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. 
 *  2.  In a U.S. clinical trial of metformin HCl tablets in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, a total of 141 patients received metformin HCl tablets up to 2,550 mg per day. Adverse reactions reported in greater than 5% of patients treated with metformin HCl tablets and that were more common than in placebo-treated patients, are listed in Table 1.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: LACTIC ACIDOSIS

  WARNING: LACTIC ACIDOSIS

    Postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis have resulted in death, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias. The onset of metformin  -   associated lactic acidosis is often subtle, accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. Metformin  -   associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (&gt;5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; and metformin plasma levels generally &gt;5 mcg/mL [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ].  



   Risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (e.g. carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate), age 65 years old or greater, having a radiological study with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states (e.g., acute congestive heart failure), excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment.  



   Steps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis in these high risk groups are provided [see   Dosage and Administration (2.3), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ].  



   If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, immediately discontinue RIOMET and institute general supportive measures in a hospital setting. Prompt hemodialysis is recommended [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ].

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *     Lactic acidosis: See boxed warning. (5.1) 
 *     Vitamin B12deficiency: Metformin may lower vitamin B12levels. Measure hematological parameters annually and vitamin B12at 2 to 3 year intervals and manage any abnormalities. (5.2) 
 *     Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues: Increased risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required (5.3) 
    
 

   5.1 Lactic Acidosis



    *    There have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (&gt; 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally &gt; 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. 
 *    If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of RIOMET. In RIOMET treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery. 
 *    Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue RIOMET and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider. 
 *    For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below: 
 *    Before initiating RIOMET, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). 
 *    RIOMET is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m  2  [see Contraindications (4) ]. 
 *    Initiation of RIOMET is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m  2  . 
 *    Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking RIOMET. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. 
 *    In patients taking RIOMET whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m  2  , assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy. 
 *     Renal impairment -The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. 
 *    The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]: 
 *    Before initiating RIOMET, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). 
 *    RIOMET is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m  2  [see Contraindications (4) ]. 
 *    Initiation of RIOMET is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m  2  . 
 *    Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking RIOMET. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. 
 *    In patients taking RIOMET whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m  2  , assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy. 
 *     Drug interactions - The concomitant use of RIOMET with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients [see Drug Interactions (7)] . 
 *     Age 65 or greater - The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients. 
 *     Radiologic studies with contrast - Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop RIOMET at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m  2  ; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart RIOMET if renal function is stable. 
 *     Surgery and other procedures - Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. RIOMET should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake. 
 *     Hypoxic states - Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue RIOMET. 
 *     Excessive alcohol intake - Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving RIOMET. 
 *     Hepatic impairment - Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of RIOMET in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. 
       5.2 Vitamin B12Deficiency
 

    *  1.  In clinical trials of 29-week duration with metformin hydrochloride (HCl) tablets, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B12supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on RIOMET and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 
       5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues
 

  Insulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. RIOMET may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with RIOMET [see Drug Interactions (7)].  



    5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes



  There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with RIOMET.
