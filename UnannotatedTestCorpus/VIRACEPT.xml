  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



    EXCERPT:    *  Most common adverse reactions (&gt;=2%) of moderate or severe intensity in adults and adolescents (13 years and older) are diarrhea, nausea, rash, and flatulence (  6.1  ). 
 *  Most common adverse reactions in pediatric patients (2 to less than 13 years) are diarrhea, leukopenia/neutropenia, rash, anorexia, and abdominal pain. (  6.2  )

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience: Adults and Adolescents (13 years and older)

  The safety of VIRACEPT was studied in over 5000 patients who received drug either alone or in combination with nucleoside analogues. The majority of adverse events were of mild intensity. The most frequently reported adverse event among patients receiving VIRACEPT was diarrhea, which was generally of mild to moderate intensity.



 Drug-related clinical adverse experiences of moderate or severe intensity in &gt;=2% of patients treated with VIRACEPT coadministered with d4T and 3TC (Study 542) for up to 48 weeks, or with ZDV plus 3TC (Study 511) for up to 24 weeks are presented in Table 4.

              6.2 Clinical Trials Experience: Pediatrics (2 to less than 13 years of age)
   VIRACEPT has been studied in approximately 400 pediatric patients in clinical trials from birth to 13 years of age. The adverse event profile seen during pediatric clinical trials was similar to that for adults.



 The most commonly reported drug-related, treatment-emergent adverse events reported in the pediatric studies included: diarrhea, leukopenia/neutropenia, rash, anorexia, and abdominal pain. Diarrhea, regardless of assigned relationship to study drug, was reported in 39% to 47% of pediatric patients receiving VIRACEPT in 2 of the larger treatment trials. Leukopenia/neutropenia was the laboratory abnormality most commonly reported as a significant event across the pediatric studies.



   6.3 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of VIRACEPT. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Body as a Whole  : hypersensitivity reactions (including bronchospasm, moderate to severe rash, fever, and edema).



   Cardiovascular System  : QTc prolongation,  torsades de pointes  .



   Digestive System  : jaundice.



   Metabolic/Nutritional System  : bilirubinemia, metabolic acidosis.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   ALERT: Find out about medicines that should not be taken with VIRACEPT.  This statement is included on the product's bottle label.



   EXCERPT:    ALERT: Find out about medicines that should not be taken with VIRACEPT.  



 *  The concomitant use of VIRACEPT and certain other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions. Consult the full prescribing information prior to and during treatment for potential drug interactions (  5.1  ,  7.3  ) 
 *  Hepatic impairment: should not be used in patients with either moderate or severe hepatic impairment (  2.4  ,  5.2  ) 
 *  Phenylketonuria: the oral powder contains 11.2 mg phenylalanine per gram of powder (  5.3  ) 
 *  Diabetes mellitus/hyperglycemia: new onset or exacerbation of pre-existing diabetes mellitus and hyperglycemia reported with protease inhibitors. In some cases after treatment discontinuation, hyperglycemia persisted (  5.4  ) 
 *  Hemophilia: increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin hematomas and hemarthrosis reported with protease inhibitors. In more than half of the cases, protease inhibitors was continued or reintroduced (  5.5  ) 
 *  Fat redistribution: observed with antiretroviral therapy (  5.6  ) 
 *  Immune reconstitution syndrome: reported with combination antiretroviral therapy, including VIRACEPT. Patients may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (  5.7  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions Due to Drug Interactions



  Initiation of VIRACEPT, a CYP3A inhibitor, in patients receiving medications metabolized by CYP3A or initiation of medications metabolized by CYP3A in patients already receiving VIRACEPT, may increase plasma concentrations of medications metabolized by CYP3A. Initiation of medications that inhibit or induce CYP3A may increase or decrease concentrations of VIRACEPT, respectively. These interactions may lead to:



 *  Clinically significant adverse reactions, potentially leading to severe, life threatening, or fatal events from greater exposures of concomitant medications. 
 *  Clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of VIRACEPT. 
 *  Loss of therapeutic effect of VIRACEPT and possible development of resistance. 
    See  Table 6  for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations [see  Drug Interactions (7)  ]  . Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during VIRACEPT therapy; review concomitant medications during VIRACEPT therapy; and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant medications [see  Contraindications (4)  and  Drug Interactions (7)  ]  .
 

    5.2 Hepatic Impairment



  VIRACEPT should not be used in patients with either moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C, score greater than or equal to 7) [see  Dosage and Administration (2.4)  and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ].  



    5.3 Phenylketonurics



  Viracept Oral Powder contains phenylalanine, a component of aspartame. Each gram of VIRACEPT powder contains 11.2 mg phenylalanine. Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria.



    5.4 Diabetes Mellitus/Hyperglycemia



  New onset diabetes mellitus, exacerbation of pre-existing diabetes mellitus and hyperglycemia have been reported during post-marketing surveillance in HIV-infected patients receiving protease inhibitor therapy. Some patients required either initiation or dose adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents for treatment of these events. In some cases diabetic ketoacidosis has occurred. In those patients who discontinued protease inhibitor therapy, hyperglycemia persisted in some cases. Because these events have been reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made and a causal relationship between protease inhibitor therapy and these events has not been established.



    5.5 Hemophilia



  There have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin hematomas and hemarthrosis, in patients with hemophilia type A and B treated with protease inhibitors. In some patients, additional factor VIII was given. In more than half of the reported cases, treatment with protease inhibitors was continued or reintroduced. A causal relationship has not been established.



    5.6 Fat Redistribution



  Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement ("buffalo hump"), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established.



    5.7 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome



  Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including VIRACEPT. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections [such as Mycobacterium avium  infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci  pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis], which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.



 Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.
