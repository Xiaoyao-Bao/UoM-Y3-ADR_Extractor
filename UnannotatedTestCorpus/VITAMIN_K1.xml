  Deaths have occurred after intravenous and intramuscular administration. (See  Box Warning  .)



 Transient "flushing sensations" and "peculiar" sensations of taste have been observed, as well as rare instances of dizziness, rapid and weak pulse, profuse sweating, brief hypotension, dyspnea, and cyanosis.



 Pain, swelling, and tenderness at the injection site may occur.



 The possibility of allergic sensitivity including an anaphylactoid reaction, should be kept in mind.



 Infrequently, usually after repeated injection, erythematous, indurated, pruritic plaques have occurred; rarely, these have progressed to scleroderma-like lesions that have persisted for long periods. In other cases, these lesions have resembled erythema perstans.



 Hyperbilirubinemia has been observed in the newborn following administration of phytonadione. This has occurred rarely and primarily with doses above those recommended (See  PRECAUTIONS  ,      Pediatric Use      ).

    BOXED WARNING: 

  

      WARNING - INTRAVENOUS AND INTRAMUSCULAR USE    



 Severe reactions, including fatalities, have occurred during and immediately after INTRAVENOUS injection of phytonadione, even when precautions have been taken to dilute the phytonadione and to avoid rapid infusion. Severe reactions, including fatalities, have also been reported following INTRAMUSCULAR administration. Typically these severe reactions have resembled hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis, including shock and cardiac and/or respiratory arrest. Some patients have exhibited these severe reactions on receiving phytonadione for the first time. Therefore the INTRAVENOUS and INTRAMUSCULAR routes should be restricted to those situations where the subcutaneous route is not feasible and the serious risk involved is considered justified.

   Drug Interactions



  Temporary resistance to prothrombin-depressing anticoagulants may result, especially when larger doses of phytonadione are used. If relatively large doses have been employed, it may be necessary when reinstituting anticoagulant therapy to use somewhat larger doses of the prothrombin-depressing anticoagulant, or to use one which acts on a different principle, such as heparin sodium.



   Laboratory Tests    



 Prothrombin time should be checked regularly as clinical conditions indicate.



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility



  Studies of carcinogenicity, mutagenesis or impairment of fertility have not been conducted with Vitamin K1Injection (Phytonadione Injectable Emulsion, USP).



    Pregnancy



  Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Vitamin K1Injection. It is also not known whether Vitamin K1Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Vitamin K1Injection should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.



    Nursing Mothers



  It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Vitamin K1Injection is administered to a nursing woman.



    Pediatric Use



  Hemolysis, jaundice, and hyperbilirubinemia in neonates, particularly those that are premature, may be related to the dose of Vitamin K1Injection. Therefore, the recommended dose should not be exceeded (See  ADVERSE REACTIONS  and  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  ).

    <Section id="S4" name="warnings">    WARNINGS



  Benzyl alcohol as a preservative in Bacteriostatic Sodium Chloride Injection has been associated with toxicity in newborns. Data are unavailable on the toxicity of other preservatives in this age group. There is no evidence to suggest that the small amount of benzyl alcohol contained in Vitamin K1Injection (Phytonadione Injectable Emulsion, USP), when used as recommended, is associated with toxicity.



 An immediate coagulant effect should not be expected after administration of phytonadione. It takes a minimum of 1 to 2 hours for measurable improvement in the prothrombin time. Whole blood or component therapy may also be necessary if bleeding is severe.



 Phytonadione will not counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin.



 When vitamin K1is used to correct excessive anticoagulant-induced hypoprothrombinemia, anticoagulant therapy still being indicated, the patient is again faced with the clotting hazards existing prior to starting the anticoagulant therapy. Phytonadione is not a clotting agent, but overzealous therapy with vitamin K1may restore conditions which originally permitted thromboembolic phenomena. Dosage should be kept as low as possible, and prothrombin time should be checked regularly as clinical conditions indicate.



 Repeated large doses of vitamin K are not warranted in liver disease if the response to initial use of the vitamin is unsatisfactory. Failure to respond to vitamin K may indicate that the condition being treated is inherently unresponsive to vitamin K.



 Benzyl alcohol has been reported to be associated with a fatal "Gasping Syndrome" in premature infants.



 WARNING: This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they required large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum.



 Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration.
