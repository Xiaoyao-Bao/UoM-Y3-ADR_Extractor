  6.1 Clinical Studies Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed cannot be directly compared to rates in other trials and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



     Study 1: IBRANCE plus Letrozole  



     Patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer for initial endocrine based therapy  



 The safety of IBRANCE (125 mg/day) plus letrozole (2.5 mg/day) versus placebo plus letrozole was evaluated in Study 1 (PALOMA-2). The data described below reflect exposure to IBRANCE in 444 out of 666 patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who received at least 1 dose of IBRANCE plus letrozole in Study 1. The median duration of treatment for IBRANCE plus letrozole was 19.8 months while the median duration of treatment for placebo plus letrozole arm was 13.8 months.



 Dose reductions due to an adverse reaction of any grade occurred in 36% of patients receiving IBRANCE plus letrozole. No dose reduction was allowed for letrozole in Study 1.



 Permanent discontinuation associated with an adverse reaction occurred in 43 of 444 (9.7%) patients receiving IBRANCE plus letrozole and in 13 of 222 (5.9%) patients receiving placebo plus letrozole. Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation for patients receiving IBRANCE plus letrozole included neutropenia (1.1%) and alanine aminotransferase increase (0.7%).



 The most common adverse reactions (&gt;=10%) of any grade reported in patients in the IBRANCE plus letrozole arm by descending frequency were neutropenia, infections, leukopenia, fatigue, nausea, alopecia, stomatitis, diarrhea, anemia, rash, asthenia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, decreased appetite, dry skin, pyrexia, and dysgeusia.



 The most frequently reported Grade &gt;=3 adverse reactions (&gt;=5%) in patients receiving IBRANCE plus letrozole by descending frequency were neutropenia, leukopenia, infections, and anemia.



 Adverse reactions (&gt;=10%) reported in patients who received IBRANCE plus letrozole or placebo plus letrozole in Study 1 are listed in Table 4.

     Patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have had disease progression on or after prior adjuvant or metastatic endocrine therapy  



 The safety of IBRANCE (125 mg/day) plus fulvestrant (500 mg) versus placebo plus fulvestrant was evaluated in Study 2 (PALOMA-3). The data described below reflect exposure to IBRANCE in 345 out of 517 patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer who received at least 1 dose of IBRANCE plus fulvestrant in Study 2. The median duration of treatment for IBRANCE plus fulvestrant was 10.8 months while the median duration of treatment for placebo plus fulvestrant arm was 4.8 months.



 Dose reductions due to an adverse reaction of any grade occurred in 36% of patients receiving IBRANCE plus fulvestrant. No dose reduction was allowed for fulvestrant in Study 2.



 Permanent discontinuation associated with an adverse reaction occurred in 19 of 345 (6%) patients receiving IBRANCE plus fulvestrant, and in 6 of 172 (3%) patients receiving placebo plus fulvestrant. Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation for those patients receiving IBRANCE plus fulvestrant included fatigue (0.6%), infections (0.6%), and thrombocytopenia (0.6%).



 The most common adverse reactions (&gt;=10%) of any grade reported in patients in the IBRANCE plus fulvestrant arm by descending frequency were neutropenia, leukopenia, infections, fatigue, nausea, anemia, stomatitis, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, alopecia, rash, decreased appetite, and pyrexia.



 The most frequently reported Grade &gt;=3 adverse reactions (&gt;=5%) in patients receiving IBRANCE plus fulvestrant in descending frequency were neutropenia and leukopenia.



 Adverse reactions (&gt;=10%) reported in patients who received IBRANCE plus fulvestrant or placebo plus fulvestrant in Study 2 are listed in Table 6.

               6.2 Postmarketing Experience
   The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of IBRANCE. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Neutropenia: Monitor complete blood count prior to start of IBRANCE therapy and at the beginning of each cycle, as well as on Day 15 of the first 2 cycles, and as clinically indicated. (  2.2  ,  5.1  ) 
 *  Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: IBRANCE can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. (  5.2  ,  8.1  ,  8.3  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Neutropenia



  Neutropenia was the most frequently reported adverse reaction in Study 1 (PALOMA-2) with an incidence of 80% and Study 2 (PALOMA-3) with an incidence of 83%. A Grade &gt;=3 decrease in neutrophil counts was reported in 66% of patients receiving IBRANCE plus letrozole in Study 1 and 66% of patients receiving IBRANCE plus fulvestrant in Study 2. In Study 1 and 2, the median time to first episode of any grade neutropenia was 15 days and the median duration of Grade &gt;=3 neutropenia was 7 days [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



 Monitor complete blood counts prior to starting IBRANCE therapy and at the beginning of each cycle, as well as on Day 15 of the first 2 cycles, and as clinically indicated. Dose interruption, dose reduction, or delay in starting treatment cycles is recommended for patients who develop Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  .



 Febrile neutropenia has been reported in 1.8% of patients exposed to IBRANCE across Studies 1 and 2. One death due to neutropenic sepsis was observed in Study 2. Physicians should inform patients to promptly report any episodes of fever [see  Patient Counseling Information (17)  ]  .



    5.2 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, IBRANCE can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of palbociclib to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis resulted in embryo-fetal toxicity at maternal exposures that were &gt;=4 times the human clinical exposure based on area under the curve (AUC). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with IBRANCE and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1  and  8.3)  and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)  ]  .
