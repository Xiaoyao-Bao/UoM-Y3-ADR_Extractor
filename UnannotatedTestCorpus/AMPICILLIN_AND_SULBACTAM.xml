       Adult Patients    



 Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection is generally well tolerated. The following adverse reactions have been reported.



   Local Adverse Reactions  



 Pain at IV injection site - 3%



 Thrombophlebitis - 3%



   Systemic Adverse Reactions  



 The most frequently reported adverse reactions were diarrhea in 3% of the patients and rash in less than 2% of the patients.



 Additional systemic reactions reported in less than 1% of the patients were: itching, nausea, vomiting, candidiasis, fatigue, malaise, headache, chest pain, flatulence, abdominal distension, glossitis, urine retention, dysuria, edema, facial swelling, erythema, chills, tightness in throat, substernal pain, epistaxis and mucosal bleeding.



       Pediatric Patients    



 Available safety data for pediatric patients treated with Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection demonstrate a similar adverse events profile to those observed in adult patients. Additionally, atypical lymphocytosis has been observed in one pediatric patient receiving Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection.



       Adverse Laboratory Changes    



 Adverse laboratory changes without regard to drug relationship that were reported during clinical trials were:



   Hepatic:  Increased AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase, and LDH.



   Hematologic:  Decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBC, WBC, neutrophils, lymphocytes, platelets and increased lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils, eosinophils, and platelets.



   Blood Chemistry:  Decreased serum albumin and total proteins.



   Renal:  Increased BUN and creatinine.



   Urinalysis:  Presence of RBC's and hyaline casts in urine.



 The following adverse reactions have been reported with ampicillin-class antibiotics and can also occur with Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection.



       Gastrointestinal    



 Gastritis, stomatitis, black "hairy" tongue and enterocolitis. Onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibiotic treatment (see    WARNINGS  ).  



       Hypersensitivity Reactions    



 Urticaria, erythema multiforme, and an occasional case of exfoliative dermatitis have been reported. These reactions may be controlled with antihistamines and, if necessary, systemic corticosteroids. Whenever such reactions occur, the drug should be discontinued, unless the opinion of the physician dictates otherwise. Serious and occasional fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions can occur with a penicillin (see    WARNINGS  ).  



       Hematologic    



 In addition to the adverse laboratory changes listed above for Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection, agranulocytosis has been reported during therapy with penicillins. All of these reactions are usually reversible on discontinuation of therapy and are believed to be hypersensitivity phenomena. Some individuals have developed positive direct Coombs Tests during treatment with Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection, as with other beta-lactam antibiotics.

    <Section id="S2" name="precautions">    PRECAUTIONS:  



     General    



 A high percentage of patients with mononucleosis who receive ampicillin develop a skin rash. Thus, ampicillin class antibiotics should not be administered to patients with mononucleosis. In patients treated with ampicillin and sulbactam the possibility of superinfections with mycotic or bacterial pathogens should be kept in mind during therapy. If superinfections occur (usually involving Pseudomonas  or Candida  ), the drug should be discontinued and/or appropriate therapy instituted.



 Prescribing ampicillin and sulbactam in the absence of proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.



     Information for Patients    



 Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.



 Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including ampicillin and sulbactam should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When ampicillin and sulbactam is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by ampicillin and sulbactam or other antibacterial drugs in the future.



     Drug Interactions    



 Probenecid decreases the renal tubular secretion of ampicillin and sulbactam. Concurrent use of probenecid with ampicillin and sulbactam may result in increased and prolonged blood levels of ampicillin and sulbactam. The concurrent administration of allopurinol and ampicillin increases substantially the incidence of rashes in patients receiving both drugs as compared to patients receiving ampicillin alone. It is not known whether this potentiation of ampicillin rashes is due to allopurinol or the hyperuricemia present in these patients. There are no data with ampicillin and sulbactam and allopurinol administered concurrently. Ampicillin and sulbactam and aminoglycosides should not be reconstituted together due to the in vitro  inactivation of aminoglycosides by the ampicillin component of ampicillin and sulbactam.



     Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions    



 Administration of ampicillin and sulbactam will result in high urine concentration of ampicillin. High urine concentrations of ampicillin may result in false positive reactions when testing for the presence of glucose in urine using ClinitestTM, Benedict's Solution or Fehling's Solution. It is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions (such as ClinistixTM) be used. Following administration of ampicillin to pregnant women, a transient decrease in plasma concentration of total conjugated estriol, estriol-glucuronide, conjugated estrone and estradiol has been noted. This effect may also occur with ampicillin and sulbactam.



     Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility    



 Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic or mutagenic potential.



     Pregnancy    



   Pregnancy Category B    



 Reproduction studies have been performed in mice, rats, and rabbits at doses up to ten (10) times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection. There are, however, no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed (see    Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions  ).    



     Labor and Delivery    



 Studies in guinea pigs have shown that intravenous administration of ampicillin decreased the uterine tone, frequency of contractions, height of contractions, and duration of contractions. However, it is not known whether the use of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection in humans during laborer delivery has immediate or delayed adverse effects on the fetus, prolongs the duration of labor, or increases the likelihood that forceps delivery or other obstetrical intervention or resuscitation of the newborn will be necessary.



     Nursing Mothers    



 Low concentrations of ampicillin and sulbactam are excreted in the milk; therefore, caution should be exercised when Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection is administered to a nursing woman.



     Pediatric Use    



 The safety and effectiveness of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection have been established for pediatric patients one year of age and older for skin and skin structure infections as approved in adults. Use of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection in pediatric patients is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from pediatric pharmacokinetic studies, a controlled clinical trial conducted in pediatric patients and post-marketing adverse events surveillance (see   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  ,  INDICATIONS AND USAGE  ,  ADVERSE REACTIONS  ,  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  ,  and   CLINICAL STUDIES    ).



 The safety and effectiveness of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection have not been established for pediatric patients for intra-abdominal infections.

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings">    WARNINGS:  



 SERIOUS AND OCCASIONALLY FATAL HYPERSENSITIVITY (ANAPHYLACTIC) REACTIONS HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN PATIENTS ON PENICILLIN THERAPY THESE REACTIONS ARE MORE APT TO OCCUR IN INDIVIDUALS WITH A HISTORY OF PENICILLIN HYPERSENSITIVITY AND/OR HYPER-SENSITIVITY REACTIONS TO MULTIPLE ALLERGENS. THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS OF INDIVIDUALS WITH A HISTORY OF PENICILLIN HYPERSENSITIVITY WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED SEVERE REACTIONS WHEN TREATED WITH CEPHALOSPORINS. BEFORE THERAPY WITH A PENICILLIN, CAREFUL INQUIRY SHOULD BE MADE CONCERNING PREVIOUS HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS TO PENICILLINS, CEPHALOSPORINS, AND OTHER ALLERGENS. IF AN ALLERGIC REACTION OCCURS, AMPICILLIN AND SULBACTAM FOR INJECTION SHOULD BE DISCONTINUED AND THE APPROPRIATE THERAPY INSTITUTED.



 SERIOUS ANAPHYLACTOID REACTIONS REQUIRE IMMEDIATE EMERGENCY TREATMENT WITH EPINEPHRINE, OXYGEN, INTRAVENOUS STEROIDS, AND AIRWAY MANAGEMENT INCLUDING INTUBATION, SHOULD ALSO BE ADMINISTERED AS INDICATED.



  Clostridium difficile  associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection, USP, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile  .



  C. difficile  produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile  cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.



 If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile  may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile  , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.
