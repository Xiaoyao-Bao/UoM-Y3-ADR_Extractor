    ADVERSE REACTIONS:  Following the administration of Thallous Chloride Tl 201 Injection, adverse anaphylactoid reactions have been reported (characterized by cardiovascular, respiratory, and cutaneous symptoms), some severe enough to require treatment. Hypotension, pruritus, flushing and diffuse rash which responds to antihistamines have been reported. Other reported events include itching, nausea/vomiting, mild diarrhea, tremor, shortness of breath, chills, fever, conjunctivitis, sweating and blurred vision.

   PRECAUTIONS:  Data are not available concerning the effect of marked alterations in blood glucose, insulin, or pH (such as is found in diabetes mellitus) on the quality of Thallous Chloride TI 201 Injection scans. Attention is directed to the fact that thallium is a potassium analog, and since the transport of potassium is affected by these factors, the possibility exists that the thallium may likewise be affected.



    General



  Do not use after the expiration time and date (5 days maximum after calibration time) stated on the label.



 Do not use if contents are turbid.



 The patient dose should be measured by a suitable radioactivity calibration system immediately prior to administration.



 Thallous Chloride TI 201 Injection, as all radioactive materials, must be handled with care and used with appropriate safety measures to minimize external radiation exposure to clinical personnel. Care should also be taken to minimize radiation exposure to patients in a manner consistent with proper patient management.



 Radiopharmaceuticals should be used only by physicians who are qualified by training and experience in the safe use and handling of radionuclides.



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility



  No long-term animal studies have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential, or whether Thallous Chloride Tl 201 Injection affects fertility in males or females.



 Ideally, examinations using radiopharmaceuticals, especially those elective in nature, of a woman of child-bearing capability should be performed during the first few (approximately 10) days following the onset of menses.



    Pregnancy



  Adequate reproductive studies have not been conducted in animals with Thallous Chloride Tl 201 Injection. It is also not known whether Thallous Chloride TI 201 Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Thallous Chloride Tl 201 Injection should not be given to a pregnant woman except when benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks.



    Nursing Mothers



  It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, nursing should not be undertaken when a patient is administered radioactive material.



    Pediatric Use



  Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population has not been established.



    Geriatric Use



  Clinical studies of Thallous Chloride TI 201 Injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

   WARNINGS:  



 In studying patients in whom myocardial infarction or ischemia is known or suspected, care should be taken to assure continuous clinical monitoring and treatment in accordance with safe, accepted procedure. Exercise stress testing should be performed only under the supervision of a qualified physician and in a laboratory equipped with appropriate resuscitation and support apparatus.



 The vial stopper contains dry natural rubber latex and may cause allergic reactions in providers or patients who are sensitive to latex.
