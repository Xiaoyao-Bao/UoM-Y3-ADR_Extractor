  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials Experience in Adult Subjects  



     In HIV-1-Infected Adult Subjects With No Antiretroviral Treatment History  



     Studies C209 and C215  



 The safety assessment of RPV, used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs, is based on the Week 96 pooled data from 1368 subjects in the Phase 3 trials TMC278-C209 (ECHO) and TMC278-C215 (THRIVE) in antiretroviral treatment-naive HIV-1-infected adult subjects. A total of 686 subjects received RPV in combination with other antiretroviral drugs as background regimen; most (N=550) received FTC/TDF as background regimen. The number of subjects randomized to the control arm EFV was 682, of which 546 received FTC/TDF as background regimen  [see  Clinical Studies (14)  ]  . The median duration of exposure for subjects in either treatment arm was 104 weeks.



 Adverse reactions observed at Week 96 in subjects who received RPV or EFV + FTC/TDF as background regimen are shown in Table 1. No new types of adverse reactions were identified between Week 48 and Week 96. The adverse reactions observed in this subset of subjects were generally consistent with those seen for the overall patient population participating in these studies (refer to the prescribing information for Edurant).



 The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment with RPV or EFV + FTC/TDF due to adverse reactions, regardless of severity, was 2% and 5%, respectively. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were psychiatric disorders: 9 (1.6%) subjects in the RPV + FTC/TDF arm and 12 (2.2%) subjects in the EFV + FTC/TDF arm. Rash led to discontinuation in 1 (0.2%) subject in the RPV + FTC/TDF arm and 10 (1.8%) subjects in the EFV + FTC/TDF arm.



     Common Adverse Reactions:  Clinical adverse reactions to RPV or EFV of at least moderate intensity (&gt;=Grade 2) reported in at least 2% of adult subjects are shown in Table 1.

     In Virologically Suppressed HIV-1-Infected Adult Subjects  



 No new adverse reactions to COMPLERA were identified in stable, virologically suppressed subjects switching to COMPLERA from a regimen containing a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor; however, the frequency of adverse reactions increased by 20% (Study 106) after switching to COMPLERA.



     Emtricitabine and Tenofovir DF:  The most common adverse reactions that occurred in at least 10% of HIV-1-infected treatment-naive adult subjects in a Phase 3 clinical trial of FTC and TDF in combination with another antiretroviral agent were diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, headache, dizziness, depression, insomnia, abnormal dreams, and rash. Adverse reactions that occurred in at least 5% of treatment-experienced or treatment-naive subjects receiving FTC or TDF with other antiretroviral agents in clinical trials included abdominal pain, dyspepsia, vomiting, fever, pain, nasopharyngitis, pneumonia, sinusitis, upper respiratory tract infection, arthralgia, back pain, myalgia, paresthesia, peripheral neuropathy (including peripheral neuritis and neuropathy), anxiety, increased cough, and rhinitis.



 Skin discoloration has been reported with higher frequency among FTC-treated subjects; it was manifested by hyperpigmentation on the palms and/or soles and was generally mild and asymptomatic. The mechanism and clinical significance are unknown.

              Emtricitabine or Tenofovir DF:  The following Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities have been previously reported in subjects treated with FTC or TDF with other antiretroviral agents in other clinical trials: increased pancreatic amylase (&gt;2.0 * ULN), increased serum amylase (&gt;175 U/L), increased lipase (&gt;3.0 * ULN), increased alkaline phosphatase (&gt;550 U/L), increased or decreased serum glucose (&lt;40 or &gt;250 mg/dL), increased glycosuria (&gt;=3+), increased creatine kinase (M: &gt;990 U/L; F: &gt;845 U/L), decreased neutrophils (&lt;750/mm  3  ), and increased hematuria (&gt;75 RBC/HPF).
 

     Adrenal Function:  In the pooled Phase 3 trials of C209 and C215, in subjects treated with RPV plus any of the allowed background regimens (N=686), at Week 96 there was an overall mean change from baseline in basal cortisol of -0.69 (-1.12, 0.27) micrograms/dL in the RPV group, and of -0.02 (-0.48, 0.44) micrograms/dL in the EFV group.



 In the RPV group, 43/588 (7.3%) of subjects with a normal 250 micrograms ACTH stimulation test at baseline developed an abnormal 250 micrograms ACTH stimulation test (peak cortisol level &lt;18.1 micrograms/dL) during the trial compared to 18/561 (3.2%) in the EFV group. Of the subjects who developed an abnormal 250 micrograms ACTH stimulation test during the trial, 14 subjects in the RPV group and 9 subjects in the EFV group had an abnormal 250 micrograms ACTH stimulation test at Week 96. Overall, there were no serious adverse events, deaths, or treatment discontinuations that could clearly be attributed to adrenal insufficiency. The clinical significance of the higher abnormal rate of 250 micrograms ACTH stimulation tests in the RPV group is not known.



     Serum Creatinine:  In the pooled Phase 3 trials of C209 and C215 in subjects treated with RPV plus any of the allowed background regimens (N=686), there was a small increase in serum creatinine over 96 weeks of treatment with RPV. Most of this increase occurred within the first 4 weeks of treatment, with a mean change of 0.1 mg/dL (range -0.3 to 0.6 mg/dL) observed through Week 96. In subjects who entered the trial with mild or moderate renal impairment, the serum creatinine increase observed was similar to that seen in subjects with normal renal function. These changes are not considered to be clinically relevant, and no subject discontinued treatment due to increases in serum creatinine. Creatinine increases were comparable by background N(t)RTIs.



     Serum Lipids:  Changes from baseline in total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides are presented in Table 3.

                   Adult Subjects Coinfected with Hepatitis B and/or Hepatitis C Virus:  In adult subjects coinfected with hepatitis B or C virus receiving RPV in studies C209 and C215, the incidence of hepatic enzyme elevation was higher than in subjects receiving RPV who were not coinfected. The same increase was also observed in the EFV arm. The pharmacokinetic exposure of RPV in coinfected subjects was comparable to that in subjects without coinfection.
 

     Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials Experience in Pediatric Subjects  



     Emtricitabine:  In addition to the adverse reactions reported in adults, anemia and hyperpigmentation were observed in 7% and 32%, respectively, of pediatric subjects (3 months to less than 18 years of age) who received treatment with FTC in the larger of two open-label, uncontrolled pediatric trials (N=116). For additional information, please consult the EMTRIVA prescribing information.



     Rilpivirine:  The safety assessment is based on the Week 48 analysis of the single-arm, open-label Phase 2 trial, TMC278-C213, in which 36 antiretroviral treatment-naive HIV-1-infected subjects 12 to less than 18 years of age and weighing at least 32 kg received RPV (25 mg once daily) in combination with other antiretroviral agents. The median duration of exposure for subjects was 63.5 weeks. No subjects discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions. No new adverse reactions were identified compared to those seen in adults.



 Adverse reactions were reported in 19 pediatric subjects (52.8%). Most adverse reactions were Grade 1 or 2. The most common adverse reactions reported in at least 2 subjects (regardless of severity) include headache (19.4%), depression (19.4%), somnolence (13.9%), nausea (11.1%), dizziness (8.3%), abdominal pain (8.3%), vomiting (5.6%), and rash (5.6%).



 Observed laboratory abnormalities were comparable to those in adults. For additional information, please consult the Edurant prescribing information.



     Adrenal Function  



 In trial TMC278-C213, at Week 48, the overall mean change from baseline in basal cortisol showed an increase of 1.59 (0.24, 2.93) micrograms/dL.



 Six of 30 (20%) subjects with a normal 250 micrograms ACTH stimulation test at baseline developed an abnormal 250 micrograms ACTH stimulation test (peak cortisol level &lt;18.1 micrograms/dL) during the trial. Three of these subjects had an abnormal 250 micrograms ACTH stimulation test at Week 48. Overall, there were no serious adverse events, deaths, or treatment discontinuations that could clearly be attributed to adrenal insufficiency. The clinical significance of the abnormal 250 micrograms ACTH stimulation tests is not known.



     Tenofovir DF:  In a pediatric clinical trial conducted in subjects 12 to less than 18 years of age, the adverse reactions observed in pediatric subjects who received treatment with TDF were consistent with those observed in clinical trials of TDF in adults  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.6)  ].  For additional information, including information on bone mineral density changes, please consult the VIREAD prescribing information.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing experience in patients receiving RPV- or TDF-containing regimens. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING:  POSTTREATMENT ACUTE EXACERBATION OF HEPATITIS B

    WARNING:  POSTTREATMENT ACUTE EXACERBATION OF HEPATITIS B  

    Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B virus (HBV) have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HBV and HIV-1 and have discontinued products containing emtricitabine (FTC) and/or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), two of the components of COMPLERA.  



   Closely monitor hepatic function with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV and discontinue COMPLERA. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  .  



   EXCERPT:   WARNING: POSTTREATMENT ACUTE EXACERBATION OF HEPATITIS B



   See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.  



   Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B virus (HBV) have been reported in patients coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV who have discontinued products containing emtricitabine (FTC) and/or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), two of the components of COMPLERA. Closely monitor hepatic function with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV and discontinue COMPLERA. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted. (  5.1  )  



 
</Section>
    <Section id="S3" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Skin and Hypersensitivity Reactions: Severe skin and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported during postmarketing experience, including cases of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS). Immediately discontinue treatment if hypersensitivity or rash with systemic symptoms or elevations in hepatic serum biochemistries develops and closely monitor clinical status, including hepatic serum biochemistries. (  5.2  ) 
 *  Hepatotoxicity: Hepatic adverse events have been reported in patients receiving a rilpivirine-containing regimen. Monitor liver-associated tests before and during treatment with COMPLERA in patients with underlying hepatic disease or marked elevations in liver-associated tests. Also consider monitoring liver-associated tests in patients without risk factors. (  5.3  ) 
 *  Depressive disorders: Severe depressive disorders have been reported. Immediate medical evaluation is recommended for severe depressive disorders. (  5.4  ) 
 *  New onset or worsening renal impairment: Can include acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome. Avoid administering COMPLERA with concurrent or recent use of nephrotoxic drugs. (  5.5  ) 
 *  Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD): Consider monitoring BMD in patients with a history of pathologic fracture or other risk factors of osteoporosis or bone loss. (  5.6  ) 
 *  Concomitant use of COMPLERA with drugs with a known risk to prolong the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram may increase the risk of Torsade de Pointes. (  5.7  ) 
 *  Lactic acidosis/severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: Discontinue treatment in patients who develop symptoms or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity. (  5.8  ) 
 *  Immune reconstitution syndrome: May necessitate further evaluation and treatment. (  5.9  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Severe Acute Exacerbation of Hepatitis B in Patients Coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV



  Test all patients with HIV-1 for the presence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) before or when initiating antiretroviral therapy [see  Dosage and Administration (2.1)  ]  .



 Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B (e.g., liver decompensation and liver failure) have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HBV and HIV-1 and have discontinued products containing FTC and/or TDF, two of the components of COMPLERA. Patients coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV who discontinue COMPLERA should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment with COMPLERA. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted, especially in patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, since posttreatment exacerbation of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation and liver failure.



    5.2 Skin and Hypersensitivity Reactions



  Severe skin and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported during the postmarketing experience, including cases of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) with RPV-containing regimens. While some skin reactions were accompanied by constitutional symptoms such as fever, other skin reactions were associated with organ dysfunctions, including elevations in hepatic serum biochemistries. During the Phase 3 clinical trials, treatment-related rashes with at least Grade 2 severity were reported in 1% of subjects receiving RPV plus FTC/TDF. Overall, most rashes were Grade 1 or 2 and occurred in the first four to six weeks of therapy [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1  and  6.2)  ]  .



 Discontinue COMPLERA immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin or hypersensitivity reactions develop, including but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, blisters, mucosal involvement, conjunctivitis, facial edema, angioedema, hepatitis, or eosinophilia. Clinical status including laboratory parameters should be monitored and appropriate therapy should be initiated.



    5.3 Hepatotoxicity



  Hepatic adverse events have been reported in patients receiving an RPV-containing regimen. Patients with underlying hepatitis B or C virus infection, or marked elevations in liver-associated tests prior to treatment, may be at increased risk for worsening or development of liver-associated test elevations with use of COMPLERA. A few cases of hepatic toxicity have been reported in adult patients receiving an RPV-containing regimen who had no pre-existing hepatic disease or other identifiable risk factors. Appropriate laboratory testing prior to initiating therapy and monitoring for hepatotoxicity during therapy with COMPLERA is recommended in patients with underlying hepatic disease such as hepatitis B or C, or in patients with marked elevations in liver-associated tests prior to treatment initiation. Liver-associated test monitoring should also be considered for patients without pre-existing hepatic dysfunction or other risk factors.



    5.4 Depressive Disorders



  The adverse reaction depressive disorders (depressed mood, depression, dysphoria, major depression, mood altered, negative thoughts, suicide attempt, suicidal ideation) has been reported with RPV. Patients with severe depressive symptoms should seek immediate medical evaluation to assess the possibility that the symptoms are related to COMPLERA, and if so, to determine whether the risks of continued therapy outweigh the benefits.



 During the Phase 3 trials in adults (N=1368) through 96 weeks, the incidence of depressive disorders (regardless of causality, severity) reported among RPV (n=686) or efavirenz (EFV, n=682) was 9% and 8%, respectively. Most events were mild or moderate in severity. The incidence of Grades 3 and 4 depressive disorders (regardless of causality) was 1% for both RPV and EFV. The incidence of discontinuation due to depressive disorders among RPV or EFV was 1% in each arm. Suicidal ideation was reported in 4 subjects in each arm while suicide attempt was reported in 2 subjects in the RPV arm.



 During the Phase 2 trial in pediatric subjects 12 to less than 18 years of age (N=36) receiving RPV through 48 weeks, the incidence of depressive disorders (regardless of causality, severity) was 19.4% (7/36). Most events were mild or moderate in severity. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 depressive disorders (regardless of causality) was 5.6% (2/36). None of the subjects discontinued due to depressive disorders. Suicidal ideation and suicide attempt were reported in 1 subject.



    5.5 New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment



  Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia), has been reported with the use of TDF [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ]  .



  Prior to initiation of COMPLERA, and during treatment with COMPLERA, on a clinically appropriate schedule, assess serum creatinine, estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein in all patients. In patients with chronic kidney disease, also assess serum phosphorus.  



 COMPLERA should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent (e.g., high-dose or multiple nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) [see  Drug Interactions (7.4)  ].  Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high-dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in HIV-infected patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on TDF. Some patients required hospitalization and renal replacement therapy. Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered, if needed, in patients at risk for renal dysfunction.



 Persistent or worsening bone pain, pain in extremities, fractures, and/or muscular pain or weakness may be manifestations of proximal renal tubulopathy and should prompt an evaluation of renal function in at-risk patients.



 Emtricitabine and TDF are principally eliminated by the kidney; however, RPV is not. Since COMPLERA is a combination product and the dose of the individual components cannot be altered, COMPLERA is not recommended in patients with estimated creatinine clearance below 50 mL per minute [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.6)  ]  .



    5.6 Bone Loss and Mineralization Defects



   Bone Mineral Density  



 In clinical trials in HIV-1-infected adults, TDF, a component of COMPLERA, was associated with slightly greater decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) and increases in biochemical markers of bone metabolism, suggesting increased bone turnover relative to comparators. Serum parathyroid hormone levels and 1,25 Vitamin D levels were also higher in subjects receiving TDF.



 Clinical trials evaluating TDF in pediatric and adolescent subjects were conducted. Under normal circumstances, BMD increases rapidly in pediatric patients. In HIV-1-infected subjects aged 2 years to less than 18 years, bone effects were similar to those observed in adult subjects and suggest increased bone turnover. Total body BMD gain was less in the TDF-treated HIV-1-infected pediatric subjects as compared to the control groups. Similar trends were observed in chronic hepatitis B-infected adolescent subjects aged 12 years to less than 18 years. In all pediatric trials, skeletal growth (height) appeared to be unaffected.



 The effects of TDF-associated changes in BMD and biochemical markers on long-term bone health and future fracture risk are unknown. Assessment of BMD should be considered for adult and pediatric patients who have a history of pathologic bone fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss. Although the effect of supplementation with calcium and Vitamin D was not studied, such supplementation may be beneficial for all patients. If bone abnormalities are suspected, then appropriate consultation should be obtained.



    Mineralization Defects  



 Cases of osteomalacia associated with proximal renal tubulopathy, manifested as bone pain or pain in extremities and which may contribute to fractures, have been reported in association with the use of TDF [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ].  Arthralgias and muscle pain or weakness have also been reported in cases of proximal renal tubulopathy. Hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia secondary to proximal renal tubulopathy should be considered in patients at risk of renal dysfunction who present with persistent or worsening bone or muscle symptoms while receiving products containing TDF [See  Warnings and Precautions (5.5)  ].  



    5.7 Risk of Adverse Reactions or Loss of Virologic Response Due to Drug Interactions



  The concomitant use of COMPLERA and other drugs may result in potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to [see  Dosage and Administration (2.5)  ,  Contraindications (4)  , and  Drug Interactions (7)  ]  :



 *  Loss of therapeutic effect of COMPLERA and possible development of resistance due to reduced exposure to RPV. 
 *   Possible clinically significant adverse reaction from greater exposures of components of COMPLERA.  
    In healthy subjects, 75 mg once daily and 300 mg once daily doses of RPV (3 times and 12 times the dose in COMPLERA) have been shown to prolong the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram. Consider alternatives to COMPLERA when coadministered with a drug that is known to have a risk of Torsade de Pointes [see  Drug Interactions (7)  and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)  ]  .
 

 See  Table 4  for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during COMPLERA therapy and review concomitant medications during COMPLERA therapy.



    5.8 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis



  Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs, including TDF and FTC, components of COMPLERA, alone or in combination with other antiretrovirals. Treatment with COMPLERA should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations).



    5.9 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome



  Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including the components of COMPLERA. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium  infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii  pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.



 Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.
