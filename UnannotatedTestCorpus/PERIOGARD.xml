  The most common side effects associated with chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse USP, 0.12% are: (1) an increase in staining of teeth and other oral surfaces, (2) an increase in calculus formation, and (3) an alteration in taste perception; see  WARNINGS  and  PRECAUTIONS  . Oral irritation and local allergy-type symptoms have been spontaneously reported as side effects associated with use of chlorhexidine gluconate rinse. The following oral mucosal side effects were reported during placebo-controlled adult clinical trials: aphthous ulcer, grossly obvious gingivitis, trauma, ulceration, erythema, desquamation, coated tongue, keratinization, geographic tongue, mucocele, and short frenum. Each occurred at a frequency of less than 1.0%.



 Among postmarketing reports, the most frequently reported oral mucosal symptoms associated with chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse USP, 0.12% are stomatitis, gingivitis, glossitis, ulcer, dry mouth, hypesthesia, glossal edema, and paresthesia.



 Minor irritation and superficial desquamation of the oral mucosa have been noted in patients using chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse.



 There have been cases of parotid gland swelling and inflammation of the salivary glands (sialadenitis) reported in patients using chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse.

   General



    *  For patients having coexisting gingivitis and periodontitis, the presence or absence of gingival inflammation following treatment with PerioGard(r) (Chlorhexidine Gluconate Oral Rinse USP, 0.12%) should not be used as a major indicator of underlying periodontitis. 
 *  PerioGard(r) can cause staining of oral surfaces, such as tooth surfaces, restorations, and the dorsum of the tongue. Not all patients will experience a visually significant increase in tooth staining. In clinical testing, 56% of the chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse USP, 0.12% users exhibited a measurable increase in facial anterior stain, compared to 35% of control users after six months; 15% of the chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse USP, 0.12% users developed what was judged to be heavy stain, compared to 1% of control users after six months. Stain will be more pronounced in patients who have heavier accumulations of unremoved plaque. Stain resulting from the use of PerioGard(r) does not adversely affect health of the gingivae or other oral tissues. Stain can be removed from most tooth surfaces by conventional professional prophylactic techniques. Additional time may be required to complete the prophylaxis. Discretion should be used when prescribing to patients with anterior facial restorations with rough surfaces or margins. If natural stain cannot be removed from these surfaces by a dental prophylaxis, patients should be excluded from PerioGard(r) treatment if permanent discoloration is unacceptable. Stain in these areas may be difficult to remove by dental prophylaxis and on rare occasions may necessitate replacement of these restorations. 
 *  Some patients may experience an alteration in taste perception while undergoing treatment with a chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse USP, 0.12%. Rare instances of permanent taste alteration following chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse USP, 0.12% use have been reported via postmarketing product surveillance. 
       Pregnancy
 

   Teratogenic Effects



   Pregnancy Category B



  Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at chlorhexidine gluconate doses up to 300 mg/kg/day and 40 mg/kg/day, respectively, and have not revealed evidence of harm to fetus. However, adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women have not been done. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.



    Nursing Mothers



  It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when PerioGard(r) (Chlorhexidine Gluconate Oral Rinse USP, 0.12%) is administered to nursing women. In parturition and lactation studies with rats, no evidence of impaired parturition or of toxic effects to suckling pups was observed when chlorhexidine gluconate was administered to dams at doses that were over 100 times greater than that which would result from a person's ingesting 30 mL (2 doses) of PerioGard(r) per day.



    Pediatric Use



  Clinical effectiveness and safety of PerioGard(r) have not been established in children under the age of 18.



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility



  In a drinking water study in rats, carcinogenic effects were not observed at doses up to 38 mg/kg/day. Mutagenic effects were not observed in two mammalian in vivo  mutagenesis studies with chlorhexidine gluconate. The highest doses of chlorhexidine used in a mouse dominant-lethal assay and a hamster cytogenetics test were 1000 mg/kg/day and 250 mg/kg/day, respectively. No evidence of impaired fertility was observed in rats at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day.

  The effect of PerioGard(r) on periodontitis has not been determined. An increase in supragingival calculus was noted in clinical testing with users of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse USP, 0.12% compared with control users. It is not known if chlorhexidine gluconate use results in an increase of subgingival calculus. Calculus deposits should be removed by a dental prophylaxis at intervals not greater than six months. Anaphylaxis, as well as serious allergic reactions, have been reported during postmarketing use with dental products containing chlorhexidine. SEE  CONTRAINDICATIONS  .
