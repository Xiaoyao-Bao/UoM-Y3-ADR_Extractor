  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     ExteNET  



 The data described below reflect exposure of NERLYNX as a single agent in ExteNET, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of NERLYNX within 2 years after completion of adjuvant treatment with trastuzumab-based therapy in women with HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer. Patients who received NERLYNX in this trial were not required to receive any prophylaxis with antidiarrheal agents to prevent the NERLYNX-related diarrhea. The median duration of treatment was 11.6 months in the NERLYNX arm and 11.8 months in the placebo arm. The median age was 52 years (60% were &gt;= 50 years old, 12% were &gt;= 65 years old); 81% were Caucasian, 3% Black or African American, 14% Asian and 3% other. A total of 1408 patients were treated with NERLYNX.



 NERLYNX dose reduction due to an adverse reaction of any grade occurred in 31.2% of patients receiving NERLYNX compared to 2.6% of patients receiving placebo. Permanent discontinuation due to any adverse reaction was reported in 27.6% of NERLYNX-treated patients. The most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was diarrhea, accounting for 16.8% of NERLYNX-treated patients.



 The most common adverse reactions (&gt;5%) were diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, fatigue, vomiting, rash, stomatitis, decreased appetite, muscle spasms, dyspepsia, AST or ALT increase, nail disorder, dry skin, abdominal distention, weight decreased and urinary tract infection. The most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, and abdominal pain.



 Serious adverse reactions in the NERLYNX arm included diarrhea (1.6%), vomiting (0.9%), dehydration (0.6%), cellulitis (0.4%), renal failure (0.4%), erysipelas (0.4%), alanine aminotransferase increased (0.3%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (0.3%), nausea (0.3%), fatigue (0.2%), and abdominal pain (0.2%).

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Diarrhea: Aggressively manage diarrhea occurring despite recommended prophylaxis with additional antidiarrheals, fluids, and electrolytes as clinically indicated. Withhold NERLYNX in patients experiencing severe and/or persistent diarrhea. Permanently discontinue NERLYNX in patients experiencing Grade 4 diarrhea or Grade &gt;= 2 diarrhea that occurs after maximal dose reduction. (  2.3  ,  5.1  ) 
 *  Hepatotoxicity: Monitor liver function tests monthly for the first 3 months of treatment, then every 3 months while on treatment and as clinically indicated. Withhold NERLYNX in patients experiencing Grade 3 liver abnormalities and permanently discontinue NERLYNX in patients experiencing Grade 4 liver abnormalities. (  2.3  ,  5.2  ) 
 *  Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: NERLYNX can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. (  5.3  ,  8.1  ,  8.3  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Diarrhea



  Severe diarrhea and sequelae, such as dehydration, hypotension, and renal failure, have been reported during treatment with NERLYNX. Diarrhea was reported in 95% of NERLYNX-treated patients in ExteNET, a randomized placebo controlled trial. In the NERLYNX arm, Grade 3 diarrhea occurred in 40% and Grade 4 diarrhea occurred in 0.1% of patients. The majority of patients (93%) had diarrhea in the first month of treatment, the median time to first onset of Grade &gt;= 3 diarrhea was 8 days (range, 1-350), and the median cumulative duration of Grade &gt;= 3 diarrhea was 5 days (range, 1-139) [ see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )  ].



 Antidiarrheal prophylaxis with loperamide has been shown to lower the incidence and severity of diarrhea. Instruct patients to initiate antidiarrheal prophylaxis with loperamide along with the first dose of NERLYNX and continue during the first two cycles (56 days) of treatment [ see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  )  ].



 Monitor patients for diarrhea and treat with additional antidiarrheals as needed. When severe diarrhea with dehydration occurs, administer fluid and electrolytes as needed, interrupt NERLYNX, and reduce subsequent doses [ see Dosage and Administration (  2.3  )  ]. Perform stool cultures as clinically indicated to exclude infectious causes of Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea or diarrhea of any grade with complicating features (dehydration, fever, neutropenia).



    5.2 Hepatotoxicity



  NERLYNX has been associated with hepatotoxicity characterized by increased liver enzymes. In ExteNET, 9.7% of patients experienced an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increase &gt;= 2 x ULN, 5.1% of patients experienced an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increase &gt;= 2 x ULN, and 1.7% of patients experienced an AST or ALT elevation &gt; 5 x ULN (&gt;= Grade 3). Hepatotoxicity or increases in liver transaminases led to drug discontinuation in 1.7% of NERLYNX-treated patients.



 Total bilirubin, AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase should be measured prior to starting treatment with NERLYNX monthly for the first 3 months of treatment, then every 3 months while on treatment and as clinically indicated. These tests should also be performed in patients experiencing Grade 3 diarrhea or any signs or symptoms of hepatotoxicity, such as worsening of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant tenderness, fever, rash, or eosinophilia [ see Dosage and Administration (  2.3  ) and Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )  ].



    5.3 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, NERLYNX can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of neratinib to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis caused abortions, embryo-fetal death and fetal abnormalities in rabbits at maternal AUCs approximately 0.2 times the AUC in patients receiving the recommended dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 1 month after the last dose. [ see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  ,  8.3  ) and Clinical Pharmacology (  12.1  )  ].
