    BOXED WARNING: 

  

    WARN    I    NG    : CARDIOVASCULAR RISK ASSOCIATED WITH SMOKING  



 Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from combination oral contraceptive use. This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked. For this reason, combination oral contraceptives, including EMOQUETTE  (r)  , should not be used by women who are over 35 years of age and smoke.

    <Section id="S3" name="precautions">     PRECAUTIONS  



    1. General  



   Patients should be counseled that this product does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases.  



     2. Physical Examination and Follow-Up  



  It is good medical practice for all women to have annual history and physical examinations, including women using oral contraceptives. The physical examination, however, may be deferred until after initiation of oral contraceptives if requested by the woman and judged appropriate by the clinician. The physical examination should include special reference to blood pressure, breasts, abdomen and pelvic organs, including cervical cytology, and relevant laboratory tests. In case of undiagnosed, persistent or recurrent abnormal vaginal bleeding, appropriate measures should be conducted to rule out malignancy. Women with a strong family history of breast cancer or who have breast nodules should be monitored with particular care.



     3. Lipid Disorders  



  Women who are being treated for hyperlipidemias should be followed closely if they elect to use oral contraceptives. Some progestogens may elevate LDL levels and may render the control of hyperlipidemias more difficult.



     4. Liver Function  



  If jaundice develops in any woman receiving oral contraceptives, the medication should be discontinued. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function.



     5. Fluid Retention  



  Oral contraceptives may cause some degree of fluid retention. They should be prescribed with caution, and only with careful monitoring, in patients with conditions which might be aggravated by fluid retention.



     6. Emotional Disorders  



  Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and the drug discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree.



     7. Contact Lenses  



  Contact lens wearers who develop visual changes or changes in lens tolerance should be assessed by an ophthalmologist.



     8. Drug Interactions  



   Consult the labeling of concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations.  Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Hormonal Contraceptives Substance   s decreasing the plasma concentrations of COCs and potentially diminishing the efficacy of COCs:  Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the plasma concentrations of COCs and potentially diminish the effectiveness of CHCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the  effectiveness of  hormonal contraceptives  include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampicin, topiramate, rifabutin, rufinamide, aprepitant, and products containing St. John's wort. Interactions between hormonal contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with CHCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability.
 

   Substance   s increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs:    Co-administration of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin and certain COCs containing EE increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20-25%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone concentrations.
 

   Hu   m   an immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/ Hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors:    Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and/or progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nelfinavir, ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, (fos) amprenavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and tipranavir/ritonavir] or increase [e.g., indinavir and atazanavir/ritonavir]) /HCV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., boceprevir and telaprevir]) or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nevirapine] or increase [e.g., etravirine]).
 

    Concomitant Use with HCV Combination Therapy - Liver Enzyme Elevation      Do not co-administer EMOQUETTE  (r)  with HCV drug combinations containing ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, due to potential for ALT elevations (see section 5 in     WARNINGS      ,     RISK OF LIVER ENZYME ELEVATIONS WITH        CONCOMITANT HEPATITIS C TREATMENT      ).
 

  Colesevela   m   :  Colesevelam, a bile acid sequestrant, given together with a combination oral hormonal contraceptive, has been shown to significantly decrease the AUC of EE. A drug interaction between the contraceptive and colesevelam was decreased when the two drug products were given 4 hours apart.



  Effects of Combined Hormonal Contraceptives on Other Drugs  COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds (e.g., cyclosporine, prednisolone, theophylline, tizanidine, and voriconazole) and increase their plasma concentrations. COCs have been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of acetaminophen, clofibric acid, morphine, salicylic acid, temazepam and lamotrigine. Significant decrease in plasma concentration of lamotrigine has been shown, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary.
 

 Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs.



     9. Interactions With Laboratory Tests  



  Certain endocrine and liver function tests and blood components may be affected by oral contraceptives:



 *  Increased prothrombin and factors VII, VIII, IX, and X; decreased antithrombin 3; increased norepinephrine-induced platelet aggregability. 
 *  Increased thyroid binding globulin (TBG) leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone, as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 by column or by radioimmunoassay. Free T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG; free T4 concentration is unaltered. 
 *  Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum. 
 *  Sex hormone binding globulins are increased and result in elevated levels of total circulating sex steroids however, free or biologically active levels either decrease or remain unchanged. 
 *  Triglycerides may be increased and levels of various other lipids and lipoproteins may be affected. 
 *  Glucose tolerance may be decreased. 
 *  Serum folate levels may be depressed by oral contraceptive therapy. This may be of clinical significance if a woman becomes pregnant shortly after discontinuing oral contraceptives.

     12. Nursing Mothers  



  Small amounts of oral contraceptive steroids have been identified in the milk of nursing mothers and a few adverse effects on the child have been reported, including jaundice and breast enlargement. In addition, oral contraceptives given in the postpartum period may interfere with lactation by decreasing the quantity and quality of breast milk. If possible, the nursing mother should be advised not to use oral contraceptives but to use other forms of contraception until she has completely weaned her child.



     13. Pediatric Use  



  Safety and efficacy of EMOQUETTE  (r)  tablets have been established in women of reproductive age. Safety and efficacy are expected to be the same for postpubertal adolescents under the age of 16 and for users 16 years and older. Use of this product before menarche is not indicated.



     14. Geriatric Use  



  This product has not been studied in women over 65 years of age and is not indicated in this population.

    <Section id="S4" name="warnings">     WARNINGS  



   Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from combination oral contraceptive use. This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked. For this reason, combination oral contraceptives, including   EMOQUETTE  (r)     , should not be used by women who are over 35 years of age and smoke.  



 The use of oral contraceptives is associated with increased risks of several serious conditions including myocardial infarction, thromboembolism, stroke, hepatic neoplasia, and gallbladder disease, although the risk of serious morbidity or mortality is very small in healthy women without underlying risk factors. The risk of morbidity and mortality increases significantly in the presence of other underlying risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemias, obesity and diabetes.



 Practitioners prescribing oral contraceptives should be familiar with the following information relating to these risks.



 The information contained in this package insert is principally based on studies carried out in patients who used oral contraceptives with formulations of higher doses of estrogens and progestogens than those in common use today. The effect of long-term use of the oral contraceptives with formulations of lower doses of both estrogens and progestogens remains to be determined.



 Throughout this labeling, epidemiological studies reported are of two types: retrospective or case control studies and prospective or cohort studies. Case control studies provide a measure of the relative risk of a disease, namely, a ratio  of the incidence of a disease among oral contraceptive users to that among nonusers. The relative risk does not provide information on the actual clinical occurrence of a disease. Cohort studies provide a measure of attributable risk, which is the difference  in the incidence of disease between oral contraceptive users and nonusers. The attributable risk does provide information about the actual occurrence of a disease in the population (Adapted from refs. 2 and 3 with the author's permission). For further information, the reader is referred to a text on epidemiological methods.



     1. Thromboembolic Disorder and Other Vascular Problems  



     a. Thromboembolism    



  An increased risk of thromboembolic and thrombotic disease associated with the use of oral contraceptives is well established. Case control studies have found the relative risk of users compared to non-users to be 3 for the first episode of superficial venous thrombosis, 4 to 11 for deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, and 1.5 to 6 for women with predisposing conditions for venous thromboembolic disease.  2, 3, 19-24  Cohort studies have shown the relative risk to be somewhat lower, about 3 for new cases and about 4.5 for new cases requiring hospitalization.  25  The risk of thromboembolic disease associated with oral contraceptives gradually disappears after combined oral contraceptive (COC) use is stopped.  2  VTE risk is highest in the first year of use and when restarting hormonal contraception after a break of four weeks or longer.



 Several epidemiologic studies indicate that third generation oral contraceptives, including those containing desogestrel, are associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism than certain second generation oral contraceptives. In general, these studies indicate an approximate 2-fold increased risk, which corresponds to an additional 1 to 2 cases of venous thromboembolism per 10,000 women-years of use. However, data from additional studies have not shown this 2-fold increase in risk.



 A two- to four-fold increase in relative risk of post-operative thromboembolic complications has been reported with the use of oral contraceptives.  9  The relative risk of venous thrombosis in women who have predisposing conditions is twice that of women without such medical conditions.  26  If feasible, oral contraceptives should be discontinued at least four weeks prior to and for two weeks after elective surgery of a type associated with an increase in risk of thromboembolism and during and following prolonged immobilization. Since the immediate postpartum period is also associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, oral contraceptives should be started no earlier than four weeks after delivery in women who elect not to breastfeed.



      b. Myocardial Infarction    



  An increased risk of myocardial infarction has been attributed to oral contraceptive use. This risk is primarily in smokers or women with other underlying risk factors for coronary artery disease such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, morbid obesity, and diabetes. The relative risk of heart attack for current oral contraceptive users has been estimated to be two to six.  4-10  The risk is very low in women under the age of 30.



 Smoking in combination with oral contraceptive use has been shown to contribute substantially to the incidence of myocardial infarctions in women in their mid-thirties or older with smoking accounting for the majority of excess cases.  11  Mortality rates associated with circulatory disease have been shown to increase substantially in smokers, especially in those 35 years of age and older and in nonsmokers over the age of 40 among women who use oral contraceptives (see Figure 1  ).




   Figure 1: CIRCULATORY DISEASE MORTALITY RATES PER 100,000WOMAN-YEARS BY AGE, SMOKING STATUS AND ORAL CONTRACEPTIVE USE(Adapted From P.M. Layde and V. Beral, ref # 12.)     
                   
       Oral contraceptives may compound the effects of well-known risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemias, age and obesity.  13  In particular, some progestogens are known to decrease HDL cholesterol and cause glucose intolerance, while estrogens may create a state of hyperinsulinism.  14-18  Oral contraceptives have been shown to increase blood pressure among users (see  section 10 in      WARNINGS    ).
 

 Similar effects on risk factors have been associated with an increased risk of heart disease. Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors.



 There is some evidence that the risk of myocardial infarction associated with oral contraceptives is lower when the progestogen has minimal androgenic activity than when the activity is greater. Receptor binding and animal studies have shown that desogestrel or its active metabolite has minimal androgenic activity (see   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY    ), although these findings have not been confirmed in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.



  CIRCULATORY DISEASE MORTALITY RATES PER 100,000 WOMAN-YEARS BY AGE, SMOKING STATUS AND ORAL CONTRACEPTIVE USE      c. Cerebrovascular Diseases    



  Oral contraceptives have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (&gt; 35 years), hypertensive women who also smoke. Hypertension was found to be a risk factor for both users and nonusers, for both types of strokes, and smoking interacted to increase the risk of stroke.  27-29  



 In a large study, the relative risk of thrombotic strokes has been shown to range from 3 for normotensive users to 14 for users with severe hypertension.  30  The relative risk of hemorrhagic stroke is reported to be 1.2 for non-smokers who used oral contraceptives, 2.6 for smokers who did not use oral contraceptives, 7.6 for smokers who used oral contraceptives, 1.8 for normotensive users and 25.7 for users with severe hypertension.  30  The attributable risk is also greater in older women.  3  



      d. Dose-Related Risk of Vascular Disease From Oral Contraceptives    



  A positive association has been observed between the amount of estrogen and progestogen in oral contraceptives and the risk of vascular disease.  31-33  A decline in serum high density lipoproteins (HDL) has been reported with many progestational agents.  14-16  A decline in serum high density lipoproteins has been associated with an increased incidence of ischemic heart disease. Because estrogens increase HDL cholesterol, the net effect of an oral contraceptive depends on a balance achieved between doses of estrogen and progestogen and the nature and absolute amount of progestogens used in the contraceptives. The amount of both hormones should be considered in the choice of an oral contraceptive.



 Minimizing exposure to estrogen and progestogen is in keeping with good principles of therapeutics. For any particular estrogen/progestogen combination, the dosage regimen prescribed should be one which contains the least amount of estrogen and progestogen that is compatible with a low failure rate and the needs of the individual patient. New acceptors of oral contraceptive agents should be started on preparations containing the lowest estrogen content which is judged appropriate for the individual patient.



      e. Persistence of Risk of Vascular Disease    



  There are two studies which have shown persistence of risk of vascular disease for ever-users of oral contraceptives. In a study in the United States, the risk of developing myocardial infarction after discontinuing oral contraceptives persists for at least 9 years for women 40 to 49 years old who had used oral contraceptives for five or more years, but this increased risk was not demonstrated in other age groups.  8  In another study in Great Britain, the risk of developing cerebrovascular disease persisted for at least 6 years after discontinuation of oral contraceptives, although excess risk was very small.  34  However, both studies were performed with oral contraceptive formulations containing 0.050 mg or higher of estrogens.



     2. Estimates of Mortality From Contraceptive Use  



  One study gathered data from a variety of sources which have estimated the mortality rate associated with different methods of contraception at different ages ( Table 2  ). These estimates include the combined risk of death associated with contraceptive methods plus the risk attributable to pregnancy in the event of method failure. Each method of contraception has its specific benefits and risks. The study concluded that with the exception of oral contraceptive users 35 and older who smoke and 40 and older who do not smoke, mortality associated with all methods of birth control is low and below that associated with childbirth.



 The observation of an increase in risk of mortality with age for oral contraceptive users is based on data gathered in the 1970's.  35  Current clinical recommendation involves the use of lower estrogen dose formulations and a careful consideration of risk factors. In 1989, the Fertility and Maternal Health Drugs Advisory Committee was asked to review the use of oral contraceptives in women 40 years of age and over. The Committee concluded that although cardiovascular disease risk may be increased with oral contraceptive use after age 40 in healthy non-smoking women (even with the newer low-dose formulations), there are also greater potential health risks associated with pregnancy in older women and with the alternative surgical and medical procedures which may be necessary if such women do not have access to effective and acceptable means of contraception. The Committee recommended that the benefits of low-dose oral contraceptive use by healthy non-smoking women over 40 may outweigh the possible risks.



 Of course, older women, as all women who take oral contraceptives, should take an oral contraceptive which contains the least amount of estrogen and progestogen that is compatible with a low failure rate and individual patient needs.

     3. Carcinoma of the Reproductive Organs and Breasts  



  Numerous epidemiological studies have been performed on the incidence of breast, endometrial, ovarian, and cervical cancer in women using oral contraceptives.



 The risk of having breast cancer diagnosed may be slightly increased among current and recent users of combined oral contraceptives (COC). However, this excess risk appears to decrease over time after COC discontinuation and by 10 years after cessation the increased risk disappears. Some studies report an increased risk with duration of use while other studies do not and no consistent relationships have been found with dose or type of steroid. Some studies have found a small increase in risk for women who first use COCs before age 20. Most studies show a similar pattern of risk with COC use regardless of a woman's reproductive history or her family breast cancer history.



 Breast cancers diagnosed in current or previous oral contraceptive users tend to be less clinically advanced than in nonusers.



 Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use oral contraceptives because breast cancer is usually a hormonally-sensitive tumor.



 Some studies suggest that oral contraceptive use has been associated with an increase in the risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in some populations of women.  45-48  However, there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors.



 In spite of many studies of the relationship between oral contraceptive use and breast and cervical cancers, a cause-and-effect relationship has not been established.



     4. Hepatic Neoplasia  



  Benign hepatic adenomas are associated with oral contraceptive use, although the incidence of benign tumors is rare in the United States. Indirect calculations have estimated the attributable risk to be in the range of 3.3 cases/100,000 for users, a risk that increases after four or more years of use especially with oral contraceptives of higher dose.  49  Rupture of benign, hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage.  50,51  



 Studies from Britain have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (&gt; 8 years) oral contraceptive users. However, these cancers are extremely rare in the U.S. and the attributable risk (the excess incidence) of liver cancers in oral contraceptive users approaches less than one per million users.



     5. Risk of Liver Enzyme Elevations with Concomitant Hepatitis C Treatment  



  During clinical trials with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen that contains ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, ALT elevations greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), including some cases greater than 20 times the ULN, were significantly more frequent in women using ethinyl estradiol-containing medications such as COCs. Discontinue EMOQUETTE  (r)  prior to starting therapy with the combination drug regimen ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir (see   CONTRAINDICATIONS    ). EMOQUETTE  (r)  can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with the combination drug regimen.



     6. Ocular Lesions  



  There have been clinical case reports of retinal thrombosis associated with the use of oral contraceptives. Oral contraceptives should be discontinued if there is unexplained partial or complete loss of vision; onset of proptosis or diplopia; papilledema; or retinal vascular lesions. Appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic measures should be undertaken immediately.



     7. Oral Contraceptive Use Before or During Early Pregnancy  



  Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy.  56-57  The majority of recent studies also do not indicate a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned,  55,56,58,59  when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy.



 The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy. Oral contraceptives should not be used during pregnancy to treat threatened or habitual abortion.



 It is recommended that for any patient who has missed two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period. Oral contraceptive use should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed.



     8. Gallbladder Disease  



  Earlier studies have reported an increased lifetime relative risk of gallbladder surgery in users of oral contraceptives and estrogens.  60,61  More recent studies, however, have shown that the relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among oral contraceptive users may be minimal.  62-64  The recent findings of minimal risk may be related to the use of oral contraceptive formulations containing lower hormonal doses of estrogens and progestogens.



     9. Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects  



  Oral contraceptives have been shown to cause a decrease in glucose tolerance in a significant percentage of users.  17  This effect has been shown to be directly related to estrogen dose.  65  In general, progestogens increase insulin secretion and create insulin resistance, this effect varying with different progestational agents.  17,66  In the nondiabetic woman, oral contraceptives appear to have no effect on fasting blood glucose.  67  Because of these demonstrated effects, prediabetic and diabetic women should be carefully monitored while taking oral contraceptives.



 A small proportion of women will have persistent hypertriglyceridemia while on the pill. As discussed earlier (see    WARNINGS    1.a.     and   1.d.    ), changes in serum triglycerides and lipoprotein levels have been reported in oral contraceptive users.



     10. Elevated Blood Pressure  



  Women with significant hypertension should not be started on hormonal contraception.  98  An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking oral contraceptives  68  and this increase is more likely in older oral contraceptive users  69  and with extended duration of use.  61  Data from the Royal College of General Practitioners  12  and subsequent randomized trials have shown that the incidence of hypertension increases with increasing progestational activity and concentrations of progestogens.



 Women with a history of hypertension or hypertension-related diseases, or renal disease  70  should be encouraged to use another method of contraception.



 If these women elect to use oral contraceptives, they should be monitored closely and if a clinically significant persistent elevation of blood pressure (BP) occurs (&gt;= 160 mm Hg systolic or &gt;= 100 mm Hg diastolic) and cannot be adequately controlled, oral contraceptives should be discontinued. In general, women who develop hypertension during hormonal contraceptive therapy should be switched to a non-hormonal contraceptive. If other contraceptive methods are not suitable, hormonal contraceptive therapy may continue combined with antihypertensive therapy. Regular monitoring of BP throughout hormonal contraceptive therapy is recommended.  102  For most women, elevated blood pressure will return to normal after stopping oral contraceptives,  69  and there is no difference in the occurrence of hypertension among former and never users.  68,70,71  



     11. Headache  



  The onset or exacerbation of migraine or development of headache with a new pattern which is recurrent, persistent or severe requires discontinuation of oral contraceptives and evaluation of the cause.



     12. Bleeding Irregularities  



  Breakthrough bleeding and spotting are sometimes encountered in patients on oral contraceptives, especially during the first three months of use. Nonhormonal causes should be considered and adequate diagnostic measures taken to rule out malignancy or pregnancy in the event of breakthrough bleeding, as in the case of any abnormal vaginal bleeding. If pathology has been excluded, time or a change to another formulation may solve the problem. In the event of amenorrhea, pregnancy should be ruled out.



 Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.



     13. Ectopic Pregnancy  



  Ectopic as well as intrauterine pregnancy may occur in contraceptive failures.
