  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 



   Adverse Reactions With the Preparative Regimen for Class 3 Beta-Thalassemia  



 The safety of TEPADINA was evaluated by retrospective analysis of 76 pediatric patients with class 3 beta-thalassemia who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor (stem) cell transplantation (HSCT) using busulfan and cyclophosphamide with TEPADINA (n=25) or without TEPADINA (n=51) [ ]. Adverse reactions were abstracted retrospectively from the medical records.



     



 Serious adverse events that occurred in the TEPADINA-treated and control cohort were, respectively: gastrointestinal hemorrhage (4% vs 2%), pneumonia (4% vs 0), seizure (4% vs 2%), subarachnoid hemorrhage (4% vs 0) and veno-occlusive disease (4% vs 2%). By 90 days after HSCT, grades 2 to 4 acute graft-versus-host disease was observed in 7 (28%) patients in the TEPADINA cohort and in 13 (26%) patients in the control cohort. By 1-year after transplantation, chronic graft-versus-host disease was observed in 8 (35%) of 23 evaluable patients in the TEPADINA cohort, and 7 (14%) of 49 evaluable patients in the control cohort.



 



 Adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients treated with TEPADINA from start of the preparative regimen through 30 days after transplantation are shown in Table 3.

   WARNING: SEVERE MYELOSUPPRESSION, CARCINOGENICITY  



 *  TEPADINA may cause severe marrow suppression, and high doses may cause marrow ablation with resulting infection or bleeding. Monitor hematologic laboratory parameters.

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



  



 



    EXCERPT:    *  Cutaneous toxicity: Cleanse skin at least twice daily through 48 hours after the last dose of TEPADINA. (5.3) 
 *  Embryo-Fetal toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to avoid pregnancy. (5.8) 
    
 

   5.1 Myelosuppression



  The consequence of treatment with high doses of TEPADINA together with other chemotherapy at the recommended dose and schedule in the preparative regimen for class 3 beta- thalassemia is profound myelosuppression occurring in all patients. Do not begin the preparative regimen if a stem cell donor is not available. Monitor complete blood counts, and provide supportive care for infections, anemia and thrombocytopenia until there is adequate hematopoietic recovery.



 For patients receiving TEPADINA for treatment of adenocarcinoma of the breast, adenocarcinoma of the ovary, malignant effusions and superficial papillary carcinoma of the urinary bladder, if the bone marrow has been compromised by prior irradiation or chemotherapy, or is recovering from chemotherapy, the risk of severe myelosuppression with TEPADINA may be increased. Perform periodic complete blood counts during the course of treatment with TEPADINA. Provide supportive care for infections, bleeding, and symptomatic anemia [   see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]  .



    5.2 Hypersensitivity



  Clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have occurred following administration of TEPADINA. If anaphylactic or other clinically significant allergic reaction occurs, discontinue treatment with TEPADINA, initiate appropriate therapy, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve [see Contraindications (   4   ), Adverse Reactions (   6.1   )]  .



    5.3 Cutaneous Toxicity



  TEPADINA and/or its active metabolites may be excreted in part via skin patients receiving high-dose therapy. Treatment with TEPADINA may cause skin discoloration, pruritus, blistering, desquamation, and peeling that may be more severe in the groin, axillae, skin folds, in the neck area, and under dressings. Instruct patients to shower or bathe with water at least twice daily through 48 hours after administration of TEPADINA. Change occlusive dressing and clean the covered skin at least twice daily through 48 hours after administration of TEPADINA. Change bed sheets daily during treatment.



 Skin reactions associated with accidental exposure to TEPADINA may also occur. Wash the skin thoroughly with soap and water in case TEPADINA solution contacts the skin. Flush mucous membranes in case of TEPADINA contact with mucous membranes.



    5.4 Concomitant Use of Live and Attenuated Vaccines



  Do not administer live or attenuated viral or bacterial vaccines to a patient treated with TEPADINA until the immunosuppressive effects have resolved.



    5.5 Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease



  Hepatic veno-occlusive disease may occur in patients who have received high-dose TEPADINA in conjunction with busulfan and cyclophosphamide [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].  Monitor by physical examination, serum transaminases and bilirubin daily through BMT Day +28, and provide supportive care to patients who develop hepatic veno-occlusive disease.



    5.6 Central Nervous System Toxicity



  Fatal encephalopathy has occurred in patients treated with high doses of thiotepa. Other central nervous system toxicities, such as headache, apathy, psychomotor retardation, disorientation, confusion, amnesia, hallucinations, drowsiness, somnolence, seizures, coma, inappropriate behaviour and forgetfulness have been reported to occur in a dose-dependent manner during or shortly after administration of high-dose thiotepa. In pediatric patients treated with TEPADINA at the recommended dose in combination with busulfan and cyclophosphamide, 8% developed central nervous system toxicity (seizures and intracranial hemorrhage). Do not exceed the recommended dose of TEPADINA. If severe or life-threatening central nervous system toxicity occurs, discontinue administration of TEPADINA and provide supportive care.



    5.7 Carcinogenicity



  Like many alkylating agents, thiotepa has been reported to be carcinogenic when administered to laboratory animals [see Nonclinical Toxicity (   13.1)]  . Carcinogenicity is shown most clearly in studies using mice, but there is some evidence of carcinogenicity in man. There is an increased risk of a secondary malignancy with use of TEPADINA.



    5.8 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, TEPADINA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of TEPADINA in pregnant women. Thiotepa given by the intraperitoneal (IP) route was teratogenic in mice at doses &gt;= 1 mg/kg (3.2 mg/m  2  ), approximately 8-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose (0.8 mg/kg, 27 mg/m  2  ), based on body-surface area. Thiotepa given by the IP route was teratogenic in rats at doses &gt;= 3 mg/kg (21 mg/m  2  ), approximately equal to the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose, based on body-surface area. Thiotepa was lethal to rabbit fetuses at a dose of 3 mg/kg (41 mg/m  2  ), approximately two times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area.



 Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus [ see Use in Specific Populations (   8.1   ,   8.3   )  ]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during and after treatment with TEPADINA for at least 6 months after therapy. Advise males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and after treatment with TEPADINA for at least 1 year after therapy [ see Use in Specific Populations (   8.1   ,   8.3   )  ].
