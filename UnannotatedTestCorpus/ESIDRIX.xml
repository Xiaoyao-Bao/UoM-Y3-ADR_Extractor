  Adverse reactions are usually reversible upon reduction of dosage or discontinuation of Esidrix. Whenever adverse reactions are moderate or severe, it may be necessary to discontinue the drug.



       The following adverse reactions have been observed, but there has not been enough systematic collection of data to support an estimate of their frequency. Consequently the reactions are categorized by organ systems and are listed in decreasing order of severity and not frequency.



        Digestive  : Pancreatitis, jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic), sialadenitis, vomiting, diarrhea, cramping, nausea, gastric irritation, constipation, anorexia.



        Cardiovascular  : Orthostatic hypotension (may be potentiated by alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics).



        Neurologic  : Vertigo, dizziness, transient blurred vision, headache, paresthesia, xanthopsia, weakness, restlessness.



        Musculoskeletal  : Muscle spasm.



        Hematologic  : Aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia.



        Metabolic  : Hyperglycemia, glycosuria, hyperuricemia.



        Hypersensitive Reactions  : Necrotizing angiitis, Stevens- Johnson syndrome, respiratory distress including pneumonitis and pulmonary edema, purpura, urticaria, rash, photosensitivity.

    General  



  All patients receiving thiazide therapy should be observed for clinical signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance: namely, hyponatremia, hypochloremic alkalosis, and hypokalemia (see Laboratory Tests and Drug/Drug Interactions). Warning signs are dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbance such as nausea or vomiting.



       Hypokalemia may develop, especially with brisk diuresis or when severe cirrhosis is present.



       Interference with adequate oral intake of electrolytes will also contribute to hypokalemia. Hypokalemia may be avoided or treated by use of potassium supplements or foods with a high potassium content.



       Any chloride deficit is generally mild and usually does not require specific treatment except under extraordinary circumstances (as in liver disease or renal disease). Dilutional hyponatremia may occur in edematous patients in hot weather; appropriate therapy is water restriction rather than administration of salt, except in rare instances when the hyponatremia is life-threatening. In actual salt depletion, appropriate replacement is the therapy of choice.



       Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy.



       Latent diabetes may become manifest during thiazide administration (see Drug/Drug Interactions).



       The antihypertensive effects of the drug may be enhanced in the postsympathectomy patient.



       If progressive renal impairment becomes evident, withholding or discontinuing diuretic therapy should be considered.



       Calcium excretion is decreased by thiazides. Pathological changes in the parathyroid gland with hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia have been observed in a few patients on prolonged thiazide therapy. The common complications of hyperparathyroidism such as renal lithiasis, bone resorption, and peptic ulceration have not been seen.



       Thiazide diuretics have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium; this may result in hypomagnesemia.



     Information for Patients  



  Patients should be informed of possible side effects and advised to take the medication regularly and continuously as directed.



     Laboratory Tests  



  Initial and periodic determinations of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals.



       Serum and urine electrolyte determinations are particularly important when the patient is vomiting excessively or receiving parenteral fluids.



     Drug/Drug Interactions  



  Hypokalemia can sensitize or exaggerate the response of the heart to the toxic effects of digitalis (e.g., increased ventricular irritability).



       Hypokalemia may develop during concomitant use of steroids or ACTH.



       Insulin requirements in diabetic patients may be increased, decreased, or unchanged.



       Thiazides may decrease arterial responsiveness to norepinephrine. This diminution is not sufficient to preclude effectiveness of the pressor agent for therapeutic use.



       Thiazide drugs may increase the responsiveness to tubocurarine.



       Lithium renal clearance is reduced by thiazides, increasing the risk of lithium toxicity.



       There have been rare reports in the literature of hemolytic anemia occurring with the concomitant use of hydrochlorothiazide and methyldopa.



       Concurrent administration of some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents may reduce the diuretic, natriurefic and anti-hypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics.



       Cholestyramine and colestipol resins: Absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively.



     Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions  



  Thiazides may decrease serum PBI levels without signs of thyroid disturbance.



       Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function (see PRECAUTIONS, General, calcium excretion).



     Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  



  Two-year feeding studies in mice and rats conducted under the auspices of the National Toxicology Program (NTP) uncovered no evidence of a carcinogenic potential of hydrochlorothiazide in female mice (at doses of up to approximately 600 mg/kg/day) or in male and female rats (at doses of up to approximately 100 mg/kg/day). The NTP, however, found equivocal evidence for hepatocarcinogenicity in male mice.



       Hydrochlorothiazide was not genotoxic in in vitro assays using strains TA 98, TA 100, TA 1535, TA 1537, and TA 1538 of Salmonella typhimurium  (Ames assay) and in the Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) test for chromosomal aberrations, or in in vivo assays using mouse germinal cell chromosomes, Chinese hamster bone marrow chromosomes, and the Drosophila  sex-linked recessive lethal trait gene. Positive test results were obtained only in the in vitro CHO Sister Chromatid Exchange (clastogenicity) and in the Mouse Lymphoma Cell (mutagenicity) assays, using concentrations of hydrochlorothiazide from 43 to 1300 ug/mL, and in the Aspergillus nidulans  nondisjunction assay at an unspecified concentration.



       Hydrochlorothiazide had no adverse effects on the fertility of mice and rats of either sex in studies wherein these species were exposed, via their diet, to doses of up to 100 and 4 mg/kg/day, respectively, prior to mating and throughout gestation.



     Pregnancy  



     Teratogenic Effects. Pregnancy Category B    



  Studies in which hydrochlorothiazide was orally administered to pregnant mice and rats during their respective periods of major organogenesis at doses up to 3000 and 1000 mg/kg/day, respectively, provided no evidence of harm to the fetus. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.



      Nonteratogenic Effects    



  Thiazides cross the placental barrier and appear in cord blood. There is a risk of fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and possibly other adverse reactions that have occurred in adults.



     Nursing Mothers  



  Thiazides are excreted in breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue Esidrix, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.



     Pediatric Use  



  Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings">     WARNINGS  



  Use with caution in severe renal disease. In patients with renal disease, thiazides may precipitate azotemia. Cumulative effects of the drug may develop in patients with impaired renal function.



       Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte imbalance may precipitate hepatic coma.



       Thiazides may add to or potentiate the action of other antihypertensive drugs. Potentiation occurs with ganglionic or peripheral adrenergic blocking drugs.



       Sensitivity reactions are more likely to occur in patients with a history of allergy or bronchial asthma.



       The possibility of exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported.
