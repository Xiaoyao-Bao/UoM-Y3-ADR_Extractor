  6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The safety of SIKLOS has been assessed in 405 pediatric patients with sickle cell disease from 2-18 years of age in the European Sickle Cell Disease prospective Cohort study ESCORT-HU.



 The most frequently reported adverse reactions in ESCORT-HU were infections and myelosuppression, with mild to moderate neutropenia as the most common manifestation.



 Other adverse reactions include skin and subcutaneous disorders (skin depigmentation/melanonychia, skin rash, alopecia), gastrointestinal disorders, vitamin D deficiency and headache.



 At least one serious adverse reaction was reported in 32.6 % of the 405 pediatric patients with sickle cell disease in ESCORT-HU. The most frequent serious adverse reactions were infections (17.8 %), and blood and lymphatic system disorders (9.1 %). This included serious neutropenia (3.2%), thrombocytopenia (3.0%) and anemia (3.0%). Other reported serious adverse reactions were gastrointestinal disorders (3.2 %), fever (2.5 %) and nervous system disorders (4.0 %), including headache (2.7%).

   The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of SIKLOS. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

 *   Blood and lymphatic system disorders : bone marrow depression including neutropenia (&lt;2.0 * 10  9  /l), reticulocytopenia (&lt;80 * 10  9  /l), macrocytosis, thrombocytopenia (&lt;80 * 10  9  /l), anemia (hemoglobin &lt;4.5g/dl) 
 *   Nervous system disorders: headache, dizziness 
 *   Gastrointestinal disorders: nausea, gastrointestinal disturbances, vomiting, gastrointestinal ulcer, severe hypomagnesemia 
 *   Hepatobiliary disorders: elevation of hepatic enzymes 
 *   Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: skin reactions (oral, ungula and cutaneous pigmentation), oral mucositis, rash, melanonychia, alopecia, leg ulcers, cutaneous dryness 
 *   Reproductive system and breast disorders : oligospermia, azoospermia, amenorrhea

  EXCERPT:   WARNING: MYELOSUPPRESSION and MALIGNANCIES



   See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning  .



 *  Myelosuppression: SIKLOS may cause severe myelosuppression. Do not give if bone marrow function is markedly depressed. Monitor blood counts at baseline and throughout treatment. Interrupt treatment and reduce dose as necessary. (5.1) 
 *  Malignancies: Hydroxyurea is carcinogenic. Advise sun protection and monitor patients for malignancies. (5.2)

   EXCERPT:    *  Embryo-Fetal toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise of potential risk to a fetus and use of effective contraception. (  5.3  ,  8.1  ,  8.3  ) 
 *  Cutaneous vasculitic toxicities (incl. leg ulcers): Institute treatment and discontinue SIKLOS and/or reduce dose if this occurs. (  5.4  ) 
 *  Risks with concomitant use of antiretroviral drugs: Pancreatitis, hepatotoxicity, and neuropathy have occurred. Monitor for signs and symptoms patients with HIV infection using antiretroviral drugs; discontinue SIKLOS, and implement treatment. (  5.5  ) 
 *  Concomitant use with live virus vaccine: increased risk of severe infections. 
    
 

   5.1 Myelosuppression



  Hydroxyurea causes severe myelosuppression. Do not initiate treatment with hydroxyurea in patients if bone marrow function is markedly depressed. Bone marrow suppression may occur, and leukopenia is generally its first and most common manifestation. Thrombocytopenia and anemia occur less often, and are seldom seen without a preceding leukopenia.



 Some patients, treated at the recommended initial dose of 20 mg/kg/day, have experienced severe or life-threatening myelosuppression. Due to the change in body weight requiring modification of daily dose, pediatric patients have an increased risk of myelosuppression at the time of dose adjustment.



 Evaluate hematologic status prior to and during treatment with SIKLOS. Provide supportive care and modify dose or discontinue SIKLOS as needed. Recovery from myelosuppression is usually observed within 15 days when therapy is interrupted. Resume therapy after interruption at a lower dose [see  Dosage and Administration (2.1)  ]  .



    5.2 Malignancies



  Hydroxyurea is a human carcinogen. In patients receiving long-term hydroxyurea for myeloproliferative disorders (a condition for which Siklos is not approved), secondary leukemia has been reported. Skin cancer has also been reported in patients receiving long-term hydroxyurea. Advise protection from sun exposure and monitor for the development of secondary malignancies.



    5.3 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, SIKLOS can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Hydroxyurea was embryotoxic and teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses 0.8 times and 0.3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily dose on a mg/m2 basis. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ]  .



 Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and after treatment with SIKLOS for at least 6 months after therapy. Advise males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and after treatment with SIKLOS for at least 6 months after therapy [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1  ,  8.3)  ]  .



    5.4 Vasculitic Toxicities (including Leg Ulcers)



  Cutaneous vasculitic toxicities, including vasculitic ulcerations and gangrene, have occurred in patients with myeloproliferative disorders during therapy with hydroxyurea. These vasculitic toxicities were reported most often in patients with a history of, or currently receiving, interferon therapy. Due to potentially severe clinical outcomes for the cutaneous vasculitic ulcers reported in patients with myeloproliferative disease (a condition for which SIKLOS is not approved), treatment with SIKLOS should be discontinued and/or its dose reduced if cutaneous vasculitic ulcerations develop. Rarely, ulcers are caused by leukocytoclastic vasculitis.



 Avoid use of SIKLOS in patients with wounds on the legs (leg ulcers).



    5.5 Risks with Concomitant Use of Antiretroviral Drugs



  Pancreatitis, hepatotoxicity, and peripheral neuropathy have occurred when hydroxyurea was administered concomitantly with antiretroviral drugs, including didanosine and stavudine [see  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ]  .



    5.6 Risks with Concomitant Use of Live Virus Vaccine



  Avoid use of live virus vaccine in patients taking SIKLOS. Concomitant use of hydroxyurea with a live virus vaccine may potentiate the replication of the vaccine virus and/or may increase the adverse reactions of the vaccine virus and result in severe infections [see  Drug Interactions (7.2)  ].  Patient's antibody response to vaccines may be decreased. Consider consultation with a specialist.



    5.7 Macrocytosis



  SIKLOS may cause macrocytosis, which is self-limiting, and is often seen early in the course of treatment. The morphologic change resembles pernicious anemia, but is not related to vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency. This may mask the diagnosis of pernicious anemia. Prophylactic administration of folic acid is recommended.



    5.8 Test Interference



  Interference with Uric Acid, Urea, or Lactic Acid Assays is possible, rendering falsely elevated results of these in patients treated with hydroxyurea [see  Drug Interactions (7.3)  ].
