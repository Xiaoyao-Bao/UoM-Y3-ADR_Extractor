  The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in the labeling:



 *  Serious cardiovascular events and stroke  [see    Boxed Warning    and    Warnings and Precautions (5.1)    ]  
 *  Vascular events [see    Warnings and Precautions (5.1)    ]  
 *  Liver disease [see    Warnings and Precautions (5.2)    ]  
    The following adverse reactions are commonly reported by COC users. Because these reactions are voluntarily reported by from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure:
 

 *  Irregular uterine bleeding 
 *  Nausea 
 *  Breast tenderness 
 *  Headache 
      EXCERPT:   The most common adverse reactions were: irregular uterine bleeding, nausea, breast tenderness, and headache. (  6  )

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: CIGARETTE SMOKING AND SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS

    WARNING: CIGARETTE SMOKING AND SERIOU    S     CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS  

    Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from combination oral contraceptive (COC) use. This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked. For this reason, COCs     are contraindicated in         women who are over 35 years of age and smoke     [see       Contraindications (4)      ].  



   EXCERPT:     WARNING: CIGARETTE SMOKING AND SERIOUS    CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS  



   See Full Prescribing Information for complete boxed warning.  



 *  FEMCON Fe is contraindicated in women over 35 years old who smoke. (4) 
 *  Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from combination oral contraceptives (COC) use. (4)

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings and precautions">     5        WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  



   EXCERPT:    *   Thrombotic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems: Stop FEMCON Fe if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding (  5.1  ) 
 *   Liver disease: Discontinue FEMCON Fe if jaundice occurs (  5.2  ) 
 *   High blood pressure:  If used in women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop FEMCON Fe if blood pressure rises significantly.(  5.4  ) 
 *   Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking FEMCON Fe. Consider an alternative contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia (  5.6  ) 
 *   Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue FEMCON Fe if indicated (  5.7  ) 
 *   Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea (  5.8  ) 
    
 

    5.1        Thrombotic   Disorders   and Other Vascular   Problems  



    *  Stop FEMCON Fe if an arterial thrombotic event or venous thromboembolic (VTE) event occurs. 
 *  Stop FEMCON Fe if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. 
 *  If feasible, stop FEMCON Fe at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of VTE as well as during the following prolonged immobilization. 
 *  Start FEMCON Fe no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum VTE decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. 
 *  The use of COCs increases the risk of VTE. However, pregnancy increases the risk of VTE as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of VTE in women using COCs is 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of COCs and when restarting hormonal contraception after a break of 4 weeks or longer. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after use is discontinued.  Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes). The risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age who smoke. 
 *  Use COCs with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. 
        5.2        Liver Disease  
 

   Impaired Liver Function  



 Do not use FEMCON Fe in women with liver disease, such as acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of liver [see  Contraindications (4)  ]. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Discontinue FEMCON Fe if jaundice develops.



  Liver Tumors  



 FEMCON Fe is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [see  Contraindications (4)  ]. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage.



 Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (&gt;8 years) COC users. However, the risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users.



     5.3        Risk of Liver Enzyme Elevations with Concomitant Hepatitis C Treatment  



   During clinical trials with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen that contains ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, ALT elevations greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN),including some cases greater than 20 times the ULN, were significantly more frequent in women using ethinyl estradiol-containing medications, such as COCs. Discontinue FEMCON Fe prior to starting therapy with the combination drug regimen ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir [ see     Contraindications (4)    ]. FEMCON Fe can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen.  



     5.   4        High Blood Pres   sure  



  FEMCON Fe is contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [see  Contraindications (4)  ]. For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop FEMCON Fe if blood pressure rises significantly.



 An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestin.



     5.   5        Gallbladder Disease  



  Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. Use of COCs may worsen existing gallbladder disease. A past history of COC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use. Women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC related cholestasis.



     5.   6        Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects  



  Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who take FEMCON Fe. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance.



 Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs.



 Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs.



     5.   7        Headache  



  If a woman taking FEMCON Fe develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue FEMCON Fe if indicated.



 Consider discontinuation of FEMCON Fe in the case of increased frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event).



     5.   8        Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea  



   Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting  



 Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different contraceptive product.



  Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea  



 Women who use FEMCON Fe may experience amenorrhea. Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuation of COCs, especially when such a condition was preexistent.



 If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.



     5.   9        COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy  



  Extensive epidemiologic studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned, when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Discontinue FEMCON Fe use if pregnancy is confirmed.



 Administration of COCs to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ].



     5.   10        Depression  



  Carefully observe women with a history of depression and discontinue FEMCON Fe if depression recurs to a serious degree.



     5.1   1        Carcinoma of the Breast and Cervix  



    *  FEMCON Fe is contraindicated in women who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [see  Contraindications (4)  ]. 
 *  There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. 
 *  Some studies suggest that COC use has been associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 
        5.1   2        Effect on Binding Globulins  
 

  The estrogen component of COCs may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, sec hormone-binding globulin, and cortisol-binding globulin. The dose of replacement thyroid hormone or cortisol therapy may need to be increased.



     5.1   3        Monitoring  



  A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare.



     5.1   4        Hereditary Angioedema  



  In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema.



     5.1   5        Chloasma  



  Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking FEMCON Fe.
