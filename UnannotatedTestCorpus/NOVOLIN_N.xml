 *   Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Symptoms of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) may include: 
  
 sweating        
                                   trouble concentrating or confusion 
                                    
 dizziness or lightheadedness 
                                   blurred vision  
                                    
 shakiness       
                                   slurred speech

                                   anxiety, irritability or mood changes 
                                    
 fast heart beat 
                                   headache        
                                    
 tingling of lips and tongue 
                                                     
        Severe low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) can cause unconsciousness (passing out), seizures, and death. Know your symptoms of low blood sugar. Follow your healthcare provider's instructions for treating low blood sugar. Talk to your healthcare provider if low blood sugar is a problem for you.
 

 *   Serious allergic reaction (whole body reaction).  Get medical help right away if you develop a rash over your whole body, have trouble breathing, a fast heartbeat, or sweating. 
   *   Reactions at the injection site (local allergic reaction). You may get redness, swelling, and itching at the injection site. If you keep having skin reactions, or they are serious, talk to your healthcare provider. You may need to stop using Novolin N and use a different insulin. Do not inject insulin into skin that is red, swollen, or itchy. 
   *   Skin thickens or pits at the injection site (lipodystrophy). Change (rotate) where you inject your insulin to help prevent these skin changes from happening. Do not inject insulin into this type of skin. 
   *   Swelling of your hands and feet  
   *   Vision changes  
   *   Low potassium in your blood (hypokalemia)  
    These are not all of the possible side effects from Novolin N. Ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist for more information.
