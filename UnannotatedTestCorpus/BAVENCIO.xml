  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The data described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS section are based on two trials, in which 1738 patients received BAVENCIO at doses of 10 mg/kg intravenously every two weeks. This included 88 patients with metastatic MCC (JAVELIN Merkel 200 trial) and 242 patients with locally advanced and metastatic UC within the JAVELIN Solid Tumor trial. In the JAVELIN Solid Tumor trial, 1650 patients were treated with BAVENCIO at doses of 10 mg/kg.



 The following criteria were used to classify an adverse reaction as immune-mediated: onset within 90 days after last dose of BAVENCIO, no spontaneous resolution within 7 days of onset, treatment with corticosteroids or other immunosuppressant or hormone replacement therapy, biopsy consistent with immune-mediated reaction, and no other clear etiology.



 The study population characteristics of the 1738 patients were median age of 64 years (range: 19 to 91 years); 52% male; 78% White, 9% Asian, 5% Black or African American, and 8% other ethnic groups; ECOG performance score of 0 (38%), 1 (62%), or &gt; 1 (0.4%); and the underlying malignancies were non-small cell lung cancer (20%), gastric and gastroesophageal cancer (15%), urothelial cancer (14%), ovarian cancer (13%), metastatic breast cancer (10%), head and neck cancer (9%), metastatic MCC (5%), mesothelioma, renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, adrenocortical carcinoma (3% each), colorectal cancer, castrate-resistant prostate cancer, and unknown (1% each). In this population, 24% of patients were exposed to BAVENCIO for &gt;= 6 months and 7% were exposed to BAVENCIO for &gt;= 12 months.



     Metastatic Merkel Cell Carcinoma  



 The data described below reflect exposure to BAVENCIO 10 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks in 88 patients with metastatic MCC enrolled in the JAVELIN Merkel 200 trial. Patients with any of the following were excluded: autoimmune disease; medical conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression; prior organ or allogeneic stem cell transplantation; prior treatment with anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-CTLA-4 antibodies; central nervous system (CNS) metastases; infection with HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C; or ECOG performance score &gt;= 2.



 The median duration of exposure to BAVENCIO was 4 months (range: 2 weeks to 21 months). Forty percent of patients received BAVENCIO for more than 6 months and 14% were treated for more than one year  [see  Clinical Studies (14.1)  ]  . The study population characteristics were: median age of 73 years (range: 33 to 88), 74% male, 92% White, ECOG performance score of 0 (56%) or 1 (44%), and 65% of patients had one prior anti-cancer therapy for metastatic MCC and 35% had two or more prior therapies.



 BAVENCIO was permanently discontinued for adverse reactions in six (7%) patients; adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation were ileus, Grade 3 transaminitis, Grade 3 creatine kinase elevation, tubulointerstitial nephritis, and Grade 3 pericardial effusion. BAVENCIO was temporarily discontinued in 21 (24%) patients for adverse events, excluding temporary dose interruption for infusion-related reactions where infusion was restarted the same day. The most common adverse reaction requiring dose interruption was anemia. Serious adverse reactions that occurred in more than one patient were acute kidney injury, anemia, abdominal pain, ileus, asthenia, and cellulitis. The most common adverse reactions (&gt;= 20%) were fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea, nausea, infusion-related reaction, rash, decreased appetite, and peripheral edema.



 Table 2 and Table 3 summarize the incidence of adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, respectively, that occurred in patients receiving BAVENCIO.

 Table 4 describes adverse reactions reported in 242 patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC receiving BAVENCIO at 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks in the UC cohorts of the JAVELIN Solid Tumor trial. Patients received pre-medication with an anti-histamine and acetaminophen prior to each infusion. The median duration of exposure to BAVENCIO was 12 weeks (range: 2 weeks to 92 weeks)  [see  Clinical Studies (14.2)  ]  .



 Fourteen patients (6%) who were treated with BAVENCIO experienced either pneumonitis, respiratory failure, sepsis/urosepsis, cerebrovascular accident, or gastrointestinal adverse events, which led to death.



 BAVENCIO was permanently discontinued for Grade 1-4 adverse reactions in 30 (12%) patients. The adverse reaction that resulted in permanent discontinuation in &gt; 1% of patients was fatigue. BAVENCIO was temporarily discontinued in 29% of patients for adverse reactions, excluding temporary dose interruption for infusion-related reactions where infusion was restarted the same day. The adverse reactions that resulted in temporary discontinuation in &gt; 1% of patients were diarrhea, fatigue, dyspnea, urinary tract infection, and rash.



 Grade 1-4 serious adverse reactions were reported in 41% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in &gt;= 2% of patients were urinary tract infection/urosepsis, abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain, creatinine increased/renal failure, dehydration, hematuria/urinary tract hemorrhage, intestinal obstruction/small intestine obstruction, and pyrexia.



 The most common Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions (&gt;= 3%) were anemia, fatigue, hyponatremia, hypertension urinary tract infection, and musculoskeletal pain.



 The most common adverse reactions (&gt;= 20%) were fatigue, infusion-related reaction, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, decreased appetite, and urinary tract infection.



 Eleven (4.5%) patients received an oral prednisone dose equivalent to &gt;= 40 mg daily for an immune-mediated adverse reaction  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5)  ]  .



 Table 4 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred in at least 10% of patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC receiving BAVENCIO while Table 5 summarizes selected Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities that occurred in &gt;= 1% of patients treated with BAVENCIO.

          6.2 Immunogenicity
   As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to avelumab in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading.



 Of the 1738 patients treated with BAVENCIO 10 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion every 2 weeks, 1558 were evaluable for treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies (ADA) and 64 (4.1%) tested positive. The development of treatment-emergent ADA against avelumab did not appear to alter the pharmacokinetic profile or risk of infusion-related reactions.

   5.1 Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis



  BAVENCIO can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis and evaluate patients with suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids (initial dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent, followed by a corticosteroid taper) for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold BAVENCIO for moderate (Grade 2) pneumonitis, and permanently discontinue for severe (Grade 3), life-threatening (Grade 4), or recurrent moderate (Grade 2) pneumonitis [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .



 Pneumonitis occurred in 1.2% (21/1738) of patients receiving BAVENCIO including one (0.1%) patient with Grade 5, one (0.1%) with Grade 4, and five (0.3%) with Grade 3 pneumonitis. Immune-mediated pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of BAVENCIO in 0.3% (6/1738) of patients. Among the 21 patients with immune-mediated pneumonitis, the median time to onset was 2.5 months (range: 3 days to 11 months) and the median duration of pneumonitis was 7 weeks (range: 4 days to 4+ months). All 21 patients were treated with systemic corticosteroids; 17 (81%) of the 21 patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median of 8 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Resolution of pneumonitis occurred in 12 (57%) of the 21 patients at the time of data cut-off.



    5.2 Immune-Mediated Hepatitis



  BAVENCIO can cause immune-mediated hepatitis including fatal cases [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Monitor patients for abnormal liver tests prior to and periodically during treatment. Administer corticosteroids (initial dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent, followed by a corticosteroid taper) for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis. Withhold BAVENCIO for moderate (Grade 2) immune-mediated hepatitis until resolution and permanently discontinue for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) immune-mediated hepatitis [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .



 Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.9% (16/1738) of patients receiving BAVENCIO including two (0.1%) patients with Grade 5 and 11 (0.6 %) patients with Grade 3 immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of BAVENCIO in 0.5% (9/1738) of patients. Among the 16 patients with immune-mediated hepatitis, the median time to onset was 3.2 months (range: 1 week to 15 months), and the median duration of hepatitis was 2.5 months (range: 1 day to 7.4+ months). All 16 patients were treated with corticosteroids; 15 (94%) of the 16 patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median of 14 days (range: 1 day to 2.5 months). Resolution of hepatitis occurred in nine (56%) of the 16 patients at the time of data cut-off.



    5.3 Immune-Mediated Colitis



  BAVENCIO can cause immune-mediated colitis [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids (initial dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent followed by a corticosteroid taper) for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold BAVENCIO for moderate or severe (Grade 2 or 3) colitis until resolution. Permanently discontinue BAVENCIO for life-threatening (Grade 4) or for recurrent (Grade 3) colitis upon re-initiation of BAVENCIO [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .



 Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.5% (26/1738) of patients receiving BAVENCIO including seven (0.4%) patients with Grade 3 colitis. Immune-mediated colitis led to permanent discontinuation of BAVENCIO in 0.5% (9/1738) of patients. Among the 26 patients with immune-mediated colitis, the median time to onset was 2.1 months (range: 2 days to 11 months) and the median duration of colitis was 6 weeks (range: 1 day to 14+ months). All 26 patients were treated with corticosteroids; 15 (58%) of the 26 patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median of 19 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Resolution of colitis occurred in 18 (70%) of the patients at the time of data cut-off.



    5.4 Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies



  BAVENCIO can cause immune-mediated endocrinopathies [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



    Adrenal Insufficiency  



 Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency during and after treatment. Administer corticosteroids as appropriate for adrenal insufficiency. Withhold BAVENCIO for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) adrenal insufficiency [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .



 Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.5% (8/1738) of patients receiving BAVENCIO including one patient (0.1%) with Grade 3 adrenal insufficiency. Immune-mediated adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of BAVENCIO in 0.1% (2/1738) of patients. Among the 8 patients with immune-mediated adrenal insufficiency, the median time to onset was 2.5 months (range: 1 day to 8 months). All eight patients were treated with corticosteroids; four (50%) of the eight patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median of 1 day (range: 1 day to 24 days).



    Thyroid Disorders (Hypothyroidism/Hyperthyroidism)  



 BAVENCIO can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment. Monitor patients for changes in thyroid function at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation. Manage hypothyroidism with hormone-replacement therapy. Initiate medical management for control of hyperthyroidism. Withhold BAVENCIO for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) thyroid disorders [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .



 Immune-mediated thyroid disorders occurred in 6% (98/1738) of patients receiving BAVENCIO including 3 (0.2%) Grade 3 immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Immune-mediated thyroid disorders led to discontinuation of BAVENCIO in 0.1% (2/1738) of patients. Hypothyroidism occurred in 90 (5%) patients; hyperthyroidism in seven (0.4%) patients; and thyroiditis in four (0.2%) patients treated with BAVENCIO. Among the 98 patients with immune-mediated thyroid disorders, the median time to onset was 2.8 months (range: 2 weeks to 13 months) and the median duration was not estimable (range: 6 days to more than 26 months). Immune-mediated thyroid disorders resolved in seven (7%) of the 98 patients.



    Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus  



 BAVENCIO can cause type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis. Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Withhold BAVENCIO and administer anti-hyperglycemics or insulin in patients with severe or life-threatening (Grade &gt;= 3) hyperglycemia. Resume treatment with BAVENCIO when metabolic control is achieved on insulin replacement or anti-hyperglycemics [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .



 Type 1 diabetes mellitus without an alternative etiology occurred in 0.1% (2/1738) of patients including two cases of Grade 3 hyperglycemia that led to permanent discontinuation of BAVENCIO.



    5.5 Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction



  BAVENCIO can cause immune-mediated nephritis [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Monitor patients for elevated serum creatinine prior to and periodically during treatment. Administer corticosteroids (initial dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent followed by a corticosteroid taper) for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold BAVENCIO for moderate (Grade 2) or severe (Grade 3) nephritis until resolution to &lt;= Grade 1. Permanently discontinue BAVENCIO for life-threatening (Grade 4) nephritis [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .



 Immune-mediated nephritis occurred in 0.1% (1/1738) of patients receiving BAVENCIO; BAVENCIO was permanently discontinued in this patient.



    5.6 Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions



  BAVENCIO can result in severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . These immune-mediated reactions may involve any organ system. Most immune-mediated reactions initially manifest during treatment with BAVENCIO; however, immune-mediated adverse reactions can occur after discontinuation of BAVENCIO.



 For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, evaluate to confirm or rule out an immune-mediated adverse reaction and to exclude other causes. Depending upon the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue BAVENCIO, administer high dose corticosteroids, and if appropriate, initiate hormone replacement therapy. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper. Resume BAVENCIO when the immune-mediated adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue BAVENCIO for any severe (Grade 3) immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ].  



 The following clinically significant, immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of less than 1% of 1738 patients treated with BAVENCIO for each of the following adverse reactions: immune-mediated myocarditis including fatal cases, immune-mediated myositis, psoriasis, arthritis, exfoliative dermatitis, erythema multiforme, pemphigoid, hypopituitarism, uveitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, and systemic inflammatory response. The following clinically significant, immune-mediated adverse reactions have been reported with other products in this class: bullous dermatitis, Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), pancreatitis, rhabdomyolysis, myasthenia gravis, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis, demyelination, vasculitis, hemolytic anemia, hypophysitis, iritis, and encephalitis.



    5.7 Infusion-Related Reactions



  BAVENCIO can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Premedicate with antihistamine and acetaminophen prior to the first 4 infusions. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions including pyrexia, chills, flushing, hypotension, dyspnea, wheezing, back pain, abdominal pain, and urticaria. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for mild or moderate infusion-related reactions. Stop the infusion and permanently discontinue BAVENCIO for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) infusion-related reactions [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



 Infusion-related reactions occurred in 25% (439/1738) of patients treated with BAVENCIO including three (0.2%) Grade 4 and nine (0.5%) Grade 3 infusion-related reactions. Ninety-three percent (1615/1738) of patients received premedication with antihistamine and acetaminophen. Eleven (92%) of the 12 patients with Grade &gt;= 3 reactions were treated with intravenous corticosteroids. Fourteen percent of patients (252/1738) had infusion-related reactions that occurred after the BAVENCIO infusion was completed.



    5.8 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  Based on its mechanism of action, BAVENCIO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Animal studies have demonstrated that inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway can lead to increased risk of immune-mediated rejection of the developing fetus resulting in fetal death. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking BAVENCIO, inform the patient of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of childbearing potential to use effective contraception during treatment with BAVENCIO and for at least one month after the last dose of BAVENCIO [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1  ,  8.3)  ]  .
