    6.1         Clinical Trial Experience  

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 AVYCAZ was evaluated in six active-controlled clinical trials in patients with cIAI, cUTI, including pyelonephritis, or HABP/VABP. These trials included two Phase 2 trials, one in cIAI and one in cUTI, as well as four Phase 3 trials, one in cIAI, one in cUTI (Trial 1), one in cIAI or cUTI due to ceftazidime non-susceptible pathogens (Trial 2) and one in HABP/VABP. Data from cUTI Trial 1 served as the primary dataset for AVYCAZ safety findings in cUTI as there was a single comparator. cUTI Trial 2 had an open-label design as well as multiple comparator regimens which prevented pooling, but provided supportive information. The six clinical trials included a total of 1809 adult patients treated with AVYCAZ and 1809 patients treated with comparators.



   Complicated Intra-    a    bdominal Infections  



 The Phase 3 cIAI trial included 529 adult patients treated with AVYCAZ 2.5 grams (ceftazidime 2 grams and avibactam 0.5 grams) administered intravenously over 120 minutes every 8 hours plus 0.5 grams metronidazole administered intravenously over 60 minutes every 8 hours and 529 patients treated with meropenem. The median age of patients treated with AVYCAZ was 50 years (range 18 to 90 years) and 22.5% of patients were 65 years of age or older. Patients were predominantly male (62%) and Caucasian (76.6%).



 Treatment discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 2.6% (14/529) of patients receiving AVYCAZ plus metronidazole and 1.3% (7/529) of patients receiving meropenem. There was no specific adverse reaction leading to discontinuation.



 Adverse reactions occurring at 5% or greater in patients receiving AVYCAZ plus metronidazole were diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.



 Table 9 lists adverse reactions occurring in 1% or more of patients receiving AVYCAZ plus metronidazole and with incidences greater than the comparator in the Phase 3 cIAI clinical trial.

           Increased    Mortality  
 

 In the Phase 3 cIAI trial, death occurred in 2.5% (13/529) of patients who received AVYCAZ plus metronidazole and in 1.5% (8/529) of patients who received meropenem. Among a subgroup of patients with baseline CrCl 30 to less than or equal to 50 mL/min, death occurred in 19.5% (8/41) of patients who received AVYCAZ plus metronidazole and in 7.0% (3/43) of patients who received meropenem. Within this subgroup, patients treated with AVYCAZ received a 33% lower daily dose than is currently recommended for patients with CrCl 30 to less than or equal to 50 mL/min [  see Dosage and Administration (    2.2    )    and Warnings and Precautions (    5.1    )  ]. In patients with normal renal function or mild renal impairment (baseline CrCl greater than 50 mL/min), death occurred in 1.0% (5/485) of patients who received AVYCAZ plus metronidazole and in 1.0% (5/484) of patients who received meropenem. The causes of death varied and contributing factors included progression of underlying infection, baseline pathogens isolated that were unlikely to respond to the study drug, and delayed surgical intervention. 



   Complicated Urinary Tract Infections, Including Pyelonephritis  



 The Phase 3 cUTI Trial 1 included 511 adult patients treated with AVYCAZ 2.5 grams (ceftazidime 2 grams and avibactam 0.5 grams) administered intravenously over 120 minutes every 8 hours and 509 patients treated with doripenem; in some patients parenteral therapy was followed by a switch to an oral antimicrobial agent [  s    ee    Clinical Studies (    14.2    )  ]. Median age of patients treated with AVYCAZ was 54 years (range 18 to 89 years) and 30.7% of patients were 65 years of age or older. Patients were predominantly female (68.3%) and Caucasian (82.4%). Patients with CrCl less than 30 mL/min were excluded.



 There were no deaths in Trial 1. Treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% (7/511) of patients receiving AVYCAZ and 1.2% (6/509) of patients receiving doripenem. There was no specific adverse reaction leading to discontinuation. 



 The most common adverse reactions occurring in 3% of cUTI patients treated with AVYCAZ were nausea and diarrhea. 



 Table 10 lists adverse reactions occurring in 1% or more of patients receiving AVYCAZ and with incidences greater than the comparator in Trial 1.

 The Phase 3 HABP/VABP trial included 436 adult patients treated with AVYCAZ 2.5 grams (ceftazidime 2 grams and avibactam 0.5 grams) administered intravenously over 120 minutes and 434 patients treated with meropenem. The median age of patients treated with AVYCAZ was 66 years (range 18 to 89 years) and 54.1% of patients were 65 years of age or older. Patients were predominantly male (74.5%) and Asian (56.2%).



 Death occurred in 9.6% (42/ 436) of patients who received AVYCAZ and in 8.3% (36/434) of patients who received meropenem. Treatment discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 3.7% (16/436) of patients receiving AVYCAZ and 3% (13/434) of patients receiving meropenem. There was no specific adverse reaction leading to discontinuation.



 Adverse reactions occurring at 5% or greater in patients receiving AVYCAZ were diarrhea and vomiting.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">     5         WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  



     EXCERPT:    *  Decreased efficacy in cIAI patients with baseline CrCl of 30 to less than or equal to 50 mL/ min. Monitor CrCl at least daily in patients with changing renal function and adjust the dose of AVYCAZ accordingly. (  5.1  ) 
 *   Hypersensitivity reactions : Includes anaphylaxis and serious skin reactions. Cross-hypersensitivity may occur in patients with a history of penicillin allergy. If an allergic reaction occurs, discontinue AVYCAZ. (  5.2  ) 
 *   Clostridium difficile  -associated  diarrhea : Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with nearly all systemic antibacterial agents, including AVYCAZ. Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. (  5.3  ) 
 *   C  entral Nervous System Reactions : Seizures and other neurologic events may occur, especially in patients with renal impairment. Adjust dose in patients with renal impairment. (  5.4  ) 
    
 

    5.1        Decreased Clinical Response in   cIAI       Patients with   Baseline Creatinine Clearance of   30       to   Less Than or Equal to   50   mL/min      



  In a Phase 3 cIAI trial, clinical cure rates were lower in a subgroup of patients with baseline CrCl of 30 to less than or equal to 50 mL/min compared to those with CrCl greater than 50 mL/min (Table 8). The reduction in clinical cure rates was more marked in patients treated with AVYCAZ plus metronidazole compared to meropenem-treated patients. Within this subgroup, patients treated with AVYCAZ received a 33% lower daily dose than is currently recommended for patients with CrCl 30 to less than or equal to 50 mL/min.



 The decreased clinical response was not observed for patients with moderate renal impairment at baseline (CrCl of 30 to less than or equal to 50 mL/min) in the Phase 3 cUTI trials or the Phase 3 HABP/VABP trial. 



 Monitor CrCl at least daily in patients with changing renal function and adjust the dosage of AVYCAZ accordingly [ see   Dosage and Administration   (    2.2   )   ,       and       Adverse Reactions (    6.1   )   ]   .

         a       Microbiological modified intent-to-treat (mMITT) population included patients who had at least one bacterial pathogen at baseline and received at least one dose of study drug.    
 

     5.   2        Hypersensitivity Reactions  



  Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions and serious skin reactions have been reported in patients receiving beta-lactam antibacterial drugs. Before therapy with AVYCAZ is instituted, careful inquiry about previous hypersensitivity reactions to other cephalosporins, penicillins, or carbapenems should be made. Exercise caution if this product is to be given to a penicillin or other beta-lactam-allergic patient because cross sensitivity among beta-lactam antibacterial drugs has been established. Discontinue the drug if an allergic reaction to AVYCAZ occurs.



     5.   3        Clostridium difficile-   associated Diarrhea  



   Clostridium difficile  -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported for nearly all systemic antibacterial drugs, including AVYCAZ, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial drugs alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of C.       difficile  .



  C. difficile  produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile  cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary because CDAD has been reported to occur more than 2 months after the administration of antibacterial drugs.



 If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, antibacterial drugs not directed against C. difficile   may need to be discontinued. Manage fluid and electrolyte levels as appropriate, supplement protein intake, monitor antibacterial treatment of C. difficile  , and institute surgical evaluation as clinically indicated.



     5.   4        Central Nervous System Reactions  



  Seizures, nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE), encephalopathy, coma, asterixis, neuromuscular excitability, and myoclonia have been reported in patients treated with ceftazidime, particularly in the setting of renal impairment. Adjust dosing based on creatinine clearance [ see Dosage and   Administration (    2.2   )  ].



     5.   5        Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria  



  Prescribing AVYCAZ in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria  [see Indications and Usage (   1.4   )]   .
