  EXCERPT:   The most commonly reported adverse reactions (&gt;=3% and greater than placebo) included the following: fatigue, dizziness, and constipation. (  6.1  )



   To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Akrimax Pharmaceuticals, LLC at 1-888-383-1733 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.  



 

    6.1    Clinical Trials Experience  

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 Adverse reactions occurring at a rate of &gt;=3%, excluding those reported more commonly in placebo, encountered in the INNOPRAN XL placebo-controlled hypertension trials and plausibly related to treatment are shown in Table 1.

              6.2    Postmarketing Experience  
   In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following reactions have been identified during post-marketing use of INNOPRAN XL. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 The following adverse reactions were observed and have been reported with use of formulations of sustained- or immediate-release propranolol.      



   Allergic:  Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions; pharyngitis and agranulocytosis; erythematous rash, fever combined with aching and sore throat, laryngospasm, and respiratory distress.



   Autoimmune:  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).



   Cardiovascular:  exacerbation of peripheral arterial disease, arterial insufficiency, usually of the Raynaud type.



   Central Nervous System:  Light-headedness, mental depression, insomnia, lassitude, weakness, fatigue, visual disturbances, hallucinations, vivid dreams, short-term memory loss, emotional lability, slightly clouded sensorium, paresthesia of hands. 



   Gastrointestinal:  Nausea, vomiting, epigastric distress, abdominal cramping, diarrhea, mesenteric arterial thrombosis, ischemic colitis.



   Genitourinary:  Male impotence; Peyronie's disease.



   Hematologic:  Agranulocytosis, nonthrombocytopenic purpura, thrombocytopenic purpura.        



   Musculoskeletal:       Myopathy, myotonia. 



   Skin and mucous membranes:  Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, dry eyes, exfoliative dermatitis, erythema multiforme, urticaria, alopecia, SLE-like reactions, and psoriasisiform rashes.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: CARDIAC ISCHEMIA AFTER ABRUPT DISCONTINUATION

    WARNING: CARDIAC ISCHEMIA AFTER ABRUPT DISCONTINUATION  

    Following abrupt discontinuation of therapy with beta-blockers, exacerbations of angina pectoris and myocardial infarction have occurred.   



   When discontinuing chronically administered     INNOPRAN XL    , particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease, gradually reduce the dose over a period of 1-2 weeks and monitor the patients. If angina markedly worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, promptly resume therapy, at least temporarily and take other measures appropriate for the management of unstable angina. Warn patients against interruption or discontinuation of therapy without physician's advice.   



   Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, avoid abrupt discontinuation of     INNOPRAN     XL therapy even in patient treated only for hypertension. (      5.1      )  



   EXCERPT:     WARNING: CARDIAC ISCHEMIA AFTER ABRUPT DISCONTINUATION  



     See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.    



   Following abrupt cessation of therapy with beta-blockers, exacerbations of angina pectoris and myocardial infarction have occurred. Warn patients against interruption or discontinuation of therapy without physician advice. (      5.1      )

    5.1   Cardiac Ischemia after Abrupt Discontinuation  



  Following abrupt discontinuation of therapy with beta-blockers, exacerbations of angina pectoris and myocardial infarction have occurred.



 When discontinuing chronically administered INNOPRAN XL, particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease, gradually reduce the dose over a period of 1-2 weeks and monitor the patients. If angina markedly worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, promptly resume therapy, at least temporarily and take other measures appropriate for the management of unstable angina. Warn patients against interruption or discontinuation of therapy without physician's advice.



 Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, avoid abrupt discontinuation of INNOPRAN XL therapy even in patients treated only for hypertension.



     5.2   Cardiac Failure  



  Beta-blockers, like INNOPRAN XL, can cause depression of myocardial contractility and may precipitate heart failure and cardiogenic shock. If signs or symptoms of heart failure develop, treat the patient according to recommended guidelines. It may be necessary to lower the dose of INNOPRAN XL or to discontinue it.



     5.3   Maintain D   uring Major Surgery  



  Chronically administered beta-blocking therapy, including INNOPRAN XL, should not be routinely withdrawn prior to major surgery; however, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures.



     5.4   Masked Signs of Hypoglycemia  



  Beta-blockers, like INNOPRAN XL, may mask tachycardia occurring with hypoglycemia, but other manifestations such as dizziness and sweating may not be significantly affected.



     5.5   Thyrotoxicosis  



  INNOPRAN XL may mask clinical signs of hyperthyroidism, such as tachycardia. Avoid abrupt withdrawal of beta-blockade, which may precipitate a thyroid storm.



     5.6   Bradycardia  



  Bradycardia, including sinus pause, heart block, and cardiac arrest have occurred with the use of INNOPRAN XL. Patients with first-degree atrioventricular block, sinus node dysfunction, or conduction disorders (including Wolff-Parkinson-White) may be at increased risk. The concomitant use of beta adrenergic blockers and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (e.g., verapamil and diltiazem), digoxin or clonidine increases the risk of significant bradycardia. Monitor heart rate and rhythm in patients receiving INNOPRAN XL. If severe bradycardia develops, reduce or stop INNOPRAN XL.



     5.7   Reduced Effectiveness of Epinephrine in Treating Anaphylaxis  



  Beta adrenergic blocker- treated patients treated with epinephrine for a severe anaphylactic reaction may be less responsive to the typical doses of epinephrine. In these patients, consider other medications (e.g., intravenous fluids, glucagon).
