  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

 The adverse reactions that result from KEPPRA injection use include all of those reported for KEPPRA tablets and oral solution. Equivalent doses of intravenous (IV) levetiracetam and oral levetiracetam result in equivalent Cmax, Cmin, and total systemic exposure to levetiracetam when the IV levetiracetam is administered as a 15-minute infusion.

     Partial Onset Seizures  

     Adults  

 In controlled clinical studies using KEPPRA tablets in adults with partial onset seizures, the most common adverse reactions in adult patients receiving KEPPRA in combination with other AEDs, for events with rates greater than placebo, were somnolence, asthenia, infection, and dizziness. Of the most common adverse reactions in adults experiencing partial onset seizures, asthenia, somnolence, and dizziness occurred predominantly during the first 4 weeks of treatment with KEPPRA.

 Table 3 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 1% of adult epilepsy patients receiving KEPPRA tablets in placebo-controlled studies and were numerically more common than in patients treated with placebo. In these studies, either KEPPRA or placebo was added to concurrent AED therapy.

 The adverse reaction data presented below was obtained from a pooled analysis of two controlled pediatric clinical studies using an oral formulation in pediatric patients 4 to 16 years of age with partial onset seizures. The most common adverse reactions in pediatric patients receiving KEPPRA in combination with other AEDs, for events with rates greater than placebo, were fatigue, aggression, nasal congestion, decreased appetite, and irritability.

 Table 5 lists adverse reactions from the pooled pediatric controlled studies (4 to 16 years of age) that occurred in at least 2% of pediatric KEPPRA-treated patients and were numerically more common than in pediatric patients treated with placebo. In these studies, either KEPPRA or placebo was added to concurrent AED therapy.

     Pediatric Patients 1 Month to &lt; 4 Years  

 In the 7-day controlled pediatric clinical study using an oral formulation of KEPPRA in children 1 month to less than 4 years of age with partial onset seizures, the most common adverse reactions in patients receiving KEPPRA in combination with other AEDs, for events with rates greater than placebo, were somnolence and irritability. Because of the shorter exposure period, incidences of adverse reactions are expected to be lower than in other pediatric studies in older patients. Therefore, other controlled pediatric data, presented above, should also be considered to apply to this age group.

 Table 6 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 5% of pediatric epilepsy patients (ages 1 month to &lt; 4 years) treated with KEPPRA in the placebo-controlled study and were numerically more common than in patients treated with placebo. In this study, either KEPPRA or placebo was added to concurrent AED therapy.

         In the 7-day controlled pediatric clinical study in patients 1 month to &lt; 4 years of age, 3% of patients receiving KEPPRA and 2% receiving placebo either discontinued or had a dose reduction as a result of an adverse reaction. There was no adverse reaction that resulted in discontinuation for more than one patient.
 

     Myoclonic Seizures  

 Although the pattern of adverse reactions in this study seems somewhat different from that seen in patients with partial seizures, this is likely due to the much smaller number of patients in this study compared to partial seizure studies. The adverse reaction pattern for patients with JME is expected to be essentially the same as for patients with partial seizures.

 In the controlled clinical study using KEPPRA tablets in patients with myoclonic seizures, the most common adverse reactions in patients receiving KEPPRA in combination with other AEDs, for events with rates greater than placebo, were somnolence, neck pain, and pharyngitis.

 Table 7 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 5% of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy patients experiencing myoclonic seizures treated with KEPPRA tablets and were numerically more common than in patients treated with placebo. In this study, either KEPPRA or placebo was added to concurrent AED therapy.

         In the placebo-controlled study using KEPPRA tablets in patients with JME, 8% of patients receiving KEPPRA and 2% receiving placebo either discontinued or had a dose reduction as a result of an adverse reaction. The adverse reactions that led to discontinuation or dose reduction and that occurred more frequently in KEPPRA-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients are presented in Table 8.

             Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures  
 

 Although the pattern of adverse reactions in this study seems somewhat different from that seen in patients with partial seizures, this is likely due to the much smaller number of patients in this study compared to partial seizure studies. The adverse reaction pattern for patients with primary generalized tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures is expected to be essentially the same as for patients with partial seizures.

 In the controlled clinical study that included patients 4 years of age and older with PGTC seizures, the most common adverse reaction in patients receiving KEPPRA oral formulation in combination with other AEDs, for events with rates greater than placebo was nasopharyngitis.

 Table 9 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 5% of idiopathic generalized epilepsy patients experiencing PGTC seizures treated with KEPPRA and were numerically more common than in patients treated with placebo. In this study, either KEPPRA or placebo was added to concurrent AED therapy.

         In the placebo-controlled study, 5% of patients receiving KEPPRA and 8% receiving placebo either discontinued or had a dose reduction during the treatment period as a result of an adverse reaction.
 

 This study was too small to adequately characterize the adverse reactions that could be expected to result in discontinuation of treatment in this population. It is expected that the adverse reactions that would lead to discontinuation in this population would be similar to those resulting in discontinuation in other epilepsy trials (see  tables 4  and  8  ).

 In addition, the following adverse reactions were seen in other controlled adult studies of KEPPRA: balance disorder, disturbance in attention, eczema, memory impairment, myalgia, and blurred vision.

     Comparison of Gender, Age and Race  

 The overall adverse reaction profile of KEPPRA was similar between females and males. There are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse reactions by age and race.

   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of KEPPRA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

 The following adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving KEPPRA worldwide. The listing is alphabetized: abnormal liver function test, acute kidney injury, anaphylaxis, angioedema, agranulocytosis, choreoathetosis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), dyskinesia, erythema multiforme, hepatic failure, hepatitis, hyponatremia, muscular weakness, pancreatitis, pancytopenia (with bone marrow suppression identified in some of these cases), panic attack, thrombocytopenia, and weight loss. Alopecia has been reported with KEPPRA use; recovery was observed in majority of cases where KEPPRA was discontinued.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">   5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

   EXCERPT:    *  Behavioral abnormalities including psychotic symptoms, suicidal ideation, irritability, and aggressive behavior have been observed; monitor patients for psychiatric signs and symptoms (  5.1  ) 
 *  Monitor for somnolence and fatigue and advise patients not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on KEPPRA (  5.2  ) 
 *  Withdrawal Seizures: KEPPRA must be gradually withdrawn. (  5.6  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Behavioral Abnormalities and Psychotic Symptoms

  KEPPRA may cause behavioral abnormalities and psychotic symptoms. Patients treated with KEPPRA should be monitored for psychiatric signs and symptoms.

    Behavioral abnormalities  

 In clinical studies using an oral formulation of KEPPRA, 13% of adult KEPPRA-treated patients and 38% of pediatric KEPPRA-treated patients (4 to 16 years of age), compared to 6% and 19% of adult and pediatric placebo-treated patients, experienced non-psychotic behavioral symptoms (reported as aggression, agitation, anger, anxiety, apathy, depersonalization, depression, emotional lability, hostility, hyperkinesias, irritability, nervousness, neurosis, and personality disorder).

 A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed to assess the neurocognitive and behavioral effects of an oral formulation of KEPPRA as adjunctive therapy in pediatric patients (4 to 16 years of age). The results from an exploratory analysis indicated a worsening in KEPPRA-treated patients on aggressive behavior (one of eight behavior dimensions), as measured in a standardized and systematic way using a validated instrument, the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL/6-18).

 In clinical studies in pediatric patients 1 month to &lt; 4 years of age, irritability was reported in 12% of the KEPPRA-treated patients compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients.

 In clinical studies, 1.7% of adult KEPPRA-treated patients discontinued treatment due to behavioral adverse reactions, compared to 0.2% of placebo-treated patients. The treatment dose was reduced in 0.8% of adult KEPPRA-treated patients and in 0.5% of placebo-treated patients. Overall, 11% of KEPPRA-treated pediatric patients experienced behavioral symptoms associated with discontinuation or dose reduction, compared to 6% of placebo-treated patients.

    Psychotic symptoms  

 In clinical studies using an oral formulation of KEPPRA, 1% of KEPPRA-treated adult patients, 2% of KEPPRA-treated pediatric patients 4 to 16 years of age, and 17% of KEPPRA-treated pediatric patients 1 month to &lt;4 years of age experienced psychotic symptoms, compared to 0.2%, 2%, and 5% in the corresponding age groups treated with placebo. In a controlled study that assessed the neurocognitive and behavioral effects of an oral formulation of KEPPRA in pediatric patients 4 to 16 years of age, 1.6% of KEPPRA-treated patients experienced paranoia, compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients. In the same study, 3.1% of KEPPRA-treated patients experienced confusional state, compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients [ see  Use in Specific Populations (8.4)    ].

 In clinical studies, two (0.3%) KEPPRA-treated adult patients were hospitalized, and their treatment was discontinued due to psychosis. Both events, reported as psychosis, developed within the first week of treatment and resolved within 1 to 2 weeks following treatment discontinuation. There was no difference between drug- and placebo-treated patients in the incidence of the pediatric patients who discontinued treatment due to psychotic and non-psychotic adverse reactions.

    5.2 Somnolence and Fatigue

  KEPPRA may cause somnolence and fatigue. Patients should be monitored for somnolence and fatigue, and be advised not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on KEPPRA to gauge whether it adversely affects their ability to drive or operate machinery.

    Somnolence  

 In controlled clinical studies using an oral formulation of KEPPRA in adult patients with partial onset seizures, 15% of KEPPRA-treated patients reported somnolence, compared to 8% of placebo-treated patients. There was no clear dose response up to 3000 mg/day. In a study in which there was no titration, about 45% of patients receiving KEPPRA 4000 mg/day reported somnolence. The somnolence was considered serious in 0.3% of KEPPRA-treated patients, compared to 0% in the placebo group. About 3% of KEPPRA-treated patients discontinued treatment due to somnolence, compared to 0.7% of placebo-treated patients. In 1.4% of KEPPRA-treated patients and 0.9% of placebo-treated patients, the dose was reduced, while 0.3% of the KEPPRA-treated patients were hospitalized due to somnolence.

    Asthenia  

 In controlled clinical studies using an oral formulation of KEPPRA in adult patients with partial onset seizures, 15% of KEPPRA-treated patients reported asthenia, compared to 9% of placebo-treated patients. Treatment was discontinued due to asthenia in 0.8% of KEPPRA-treated patients as compared to 0.5% of placebo-treated patients. In 0.5% of KEPPRA-treated patients and in 0.2% of placebo-treated patients, the dose was reduced due to asthenia.

 Somnolence and asthenia occurred most frequently within the first 4 weeks of treatment. In general, the incidences of somnolence and fatigue in the pediatric partial onset seizure studies, and in pediatric and adult myoclonic and primary generalized tonic-clonic studies were comparable to those of the adult partial onset seizure studies.

    5.3 Anaphylaxis and Angioedema

   KEPPRA can cause anaphylaxis or angioedema after the first dose or at any time during treatment. Signs and symptoms in cases reported in the postmarketing setting have included hypotension, hives, rash, respiratory distress, and swelling of the face, lip, mouth, eye, tongue, throat, and feet. In some reported cases, reactions were life-threatening and required emergency treatment. If a patient develops signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis or angioedema, KEPPRA should be discontinued and the patient should seek immediate medical attention. KEPPRA should be discontinued permanently if a clear alternative etiology for the reaction cannot be established [ see  Contraindications (4)    ].  

    5.4 Serious Dermatological Reactions

  Serious dermatological reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), have been reported in both pediatric and adult patients treated with KEPPRA. The median time of onset is reported to be 14 to 17 days, but cases have been reported at least four months after initiation of treatment. Recurrence of the serious skin reactions following rechallenge with KEPPRA has also been reported. KEPPRA should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered.

    5.5 Coordination Difficulties

  KEPPRA may cause coordination difficulties.

 In controlled clinical studies using an oral formulation of KEPPRA in adult patients with partial onset seizures, 3.4% of KEPPRA-treated patients experienced coordination difficulties, (reported as ataxia, abnormal gait, or incoordination) compared to 1.6% of placebo-treated patients. A total of 0.4% of patients in controlled clinical studies discontinued KEPPRA treatment due to ataxia, compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients. In 0.7% of KEPPRA-treated patients and in 0.2% of placebo-treated patients, the dose was reduced due to coordination difficulties, while one of the treated patients was hospitalized due to worsening of pre-existing ataxia. These events occurred most frequently within the first 4 weeks of treatment.

 Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of coordination difficulties and advised not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on KEPPRA to gauge whether it could adversely affect their ability to drive or operate machinery.

    5.6 Withdrawal Seizures

  Antiepileptic drugs, including KEPPRA, should be withdrawn gradually to minimize the potential of increased seizure frequency.

    5.7 Hematologic Abnormalities

   KEPPRA can cause hematologic abnormalities. Hematologic abnormalities occurred in clinical trials and included decreases in white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil, and red blood cells counts (RBC); decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit; and increases in eosinophil counts. Cases of agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, and thrombocytopenia have been reported in the postmarketing setting. A complete blood count is recommended in patients experiencing significant weakness, pyrexia, recurrent infections, or coagulation disorders.  

    Partial Onset Seizures  

    Adults  

 In controlled clinical studies using an oral formulation of KEPPRA in adult patients with partial onset seizures, minor but statistically significant decreases compared to placebo in total mean RBC (0.03 * 10  6  /mm  3  ), mean hemoglobin (0.09 g/dL), and mean hematocrit (0.38%), were seen in KEPPRA-treated patients.

 A total of 3.2% of KEPPRA-treated and 1.8% of placebo-treated patients had at least one possibly significant (&lt;=2.8 * 10  9  /L) decreased WBC, and 2.4% of KEPPRA-treated and 1.4% of placebo-treated patients had at least one possibly significant (&lt;=1.0 * 10  9  /L) decreased neutrophil count. Of the KEPPRA-treated patients with a low neutrophil count, all but one rose towards or to baseline with continued treatment. No patient was discontinued secondary to low neutrophil counts.

    Pediatric Patients 4 Years to &lt; 16 Years  

 In a controlled study in pediatric patients age 4 years to &lt;16 years, statistically significant decreases in WBC and neutrophil counts were seen in KEPPRA-treated patients, as compared to placebo. The mean decreases from baseline in the KEPPRA-treated group were -0.4 * 10  9  /L and -0.3 * 10  9  /L, respectively, whereas there were small increases in the placebo group. Mean relative lymphocyte counts increased by 1.7% in KEPPRA-treated patients, compared to a decrease of 4% in placebo-treated patients (statistically significant).

 More KEPPRA-treated patients had a possibly clinically significant abnormally low WBC value (3% of KEPPRA-treated patients versus 0% of placebo-treated patients); however, there was no apparent difference between treatment groups with respect to neutrophil count (5% on KEPPRA versus 4.2% on placebo). No patient was discontinued because of low WBC or neutrophil count.

 In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the neurocognitive and behavioral effects of an oral formulation of KEPPRA as adjunctive therapy in pediatric patients (4 to 16 years of age), 5 patients (8.6%) in the KEPPRA-treated group and two patients (6.1%) in the placebo-treated group had high eosinophil count values that were possibly clinically significant (&gt;=10% or &gt;=0.7*10  9  /L).

    5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure

  In a randomized, placebo-controlled study in patients 1 month to &lt;4 years of age using an oral formulation of KEPPRA, a significantly higher risk of increased diastolic blood pressure was observed in the KEPPRA-treated patients (17%), compared to placebo-treated patients (2%). There was no overall difference in mean diastolic blood pressure between the treatment groups. This disparity between the KEPPRA and placebo treatment groups was not observed in the studies of older children or in adults.

 Monitor patients 1 month to &lt;4 years of age for increases in diastolic blood pressure.

    5.9 Seizure Control During Pregnancy

  Physiological changes may gradually decrease plasma levels of levetiracetam throughout pregnancy. This decrease is more pronounced during the third trimester. It is recommended that patients be monitored carefully during pregnancy. Close monitoring should continue through the postpartum period especially if the dose was changed during pregnancy.
