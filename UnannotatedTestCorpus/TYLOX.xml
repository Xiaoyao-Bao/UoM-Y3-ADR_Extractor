  The most frequently observed adverse reactions include lightheadedness, dizziness, sedation, nausea, and vomiting. These effects seem to be more prominent in ambulatory than in non-ambulatory patients, and some of these adverse reactions may be alleviated if the patient lies down.



 Other adverse reactions include allergic reactions, euphoria, dysphoria, constipation, skin rash, and pruritus. At higher doses, oxycodone has most of the disadvantages of morphine including respiratory depression.

    BOXED WARNING: HEPATOTOXICITY

    HEPATOTOXICITY  

    Acetaminophen has been associated with cases of acute liver failure, at times resulting in liver transplant and death. Most of the cases of liver injury are associated with the use of acetaminophen at doses that exceed 4,000 milligrams per day, and often involve more than one acetaminophen-containing product (see   WARNINGS  ).

   General



   Head Injury and Increased Intracranial Pressure



  The respiratory depressant effects of narcotics and their capacity to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of head injury, other intracranial lesions or a preexisting increase in intracranial pressure. Furthermore, narcotics produce adverse reactions which may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injuries.



    Acute Abdominal Conditions



  The administration of TYLOX  (r)  (oxycodone and acetaminophen capsules) or other narcotics may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal conditions.



    Special Risk Patients



  TYLOX  (r)  should be given with caution to certain patients such as the elderly or debilitated, and those with severe impairment of hepatic or renal function, hypothyroidism, Addison's disease, and prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture.



    Information for Patients



    *  Do not take TYLOX  (r)  if you are allergic to any of its ingredients. 
 *  If you develop signs of allergy such as a rash or difficulty breathing, stop taking TYLOX  (r)  and contact your healthcare provider immediately. 
 *  Do not take more than 4,000 milligrams of acetaminophen per day. Call your healthcare provider if you took more than the recommended dose. 
 *  Oxycodone may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery. Exercise caution until you are reasonably certain that TYLOX  (r)  does not adversely affect your ability to engage in such activities. 
       Drug Interactions
 

  Patients receiving other narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other tranquilizers, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) concomitantly with TYLOX  (r)  may exhibit an additive CNS depression. When such combined therapy is contemplated, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced.



 The concurrent use of anticholinergics with narcotics may produce paralytic ileus.



    Usage in Pregnancy



   Pregnancy Category C



  Animal reproductive studies have not been conducted with TYLOX  (r)  . It is also not known whether TYLOX  (r)  can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity. TYLOX  (r)  should not be given to a pregnant woman, unless in the judgment of the physician, the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards.



    Nonteratogenic Effects



  Use of narcotics during pregnancy may produce physical dependence in the neonate.



    Labor and Delivery



  As with all narcotics, administration of TYLOX  (r)  to the mother shortly before delivery may result in some degree of respiratory depression in the newborn and the mother, especially if higher doses are used.



    Nursing Mothers



  It is not known whether the components of TYLOX  (r)  are excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when TYLOX  (r)  is administered to a nursing woman.



    Pediatric Use



  Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.

   Hepatotoxicity



   Acetaminophen has been associated with cases of acute liver failure, at times resulting in liver transplant and death. Most of the cases of liver injury are associated with the use of acetaminophen at doses that exceed 4,000 milligrams per day, and often involve more than one acetaminophen-containing product. The excessive intake of acetaminophen may be intentional to cause self-harm or unintentional as patients attempt to obtain more pain relief or unknowingly take other acetaminophen-containing products (see  Boxed Warning  ).  



  The risk of acute liver failure is higher in individuals with underlying liver disease and in individuals who ingest alcohol while taking acetaminophen.  



  Instruct patients to look for acetaminophen or APAP on package labels and not to use more than one product that contains acetaminophen. Instruct patients to seek medical attention immediately upon ingestion of more than 4,000 milligrams of acetaminophen per day, even if they feel well.  



    Hypersensitivity/Anaphylaxis



  There have been post-marketing reports of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis associated with the use of acetaminophen. Clinical signs included swelling of the face, mouth, and throat, respiratory distress, urticaria, rash, pruritus, and vomiting. There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergency medical attention. Instruct patients to discontinue TYLOX  (r)  immediately and seek medical care if they experience these symptoms. Do not prescribe TYLOX  (r)  for patients with acetaminophen allergy.



 TYLOX  (r)  contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people.



    Drug Dependence



  Oxycodone can produce drug dependence of the morphine type and, therefore, has the potential for being abused. Psychic dependence, physical dependence, and tolerance may develop upon repeated administration of TYLOX  (r)  (oxycodone and acetaminophen capsules), and it should be prescribed and administered with the same degree of caution appropriate to the use of other oral narcotic-containing medications. Like other narcotic-containing medications, TYLOX  (r)  is subject to the Federal Control Substances Act (Schedule II).
