         The following adverse events also reported in more than 1% of PROPULSID  (r)  patients were more frequently reported on placebo: dizziness, vomiting, pharyngitis, chest pain, fatigue, back pain, depression, dehydration and myalgia.
 

 Diarrhea, abdominal pain, constipation, flatulence and rhinitis all occurred more frequently in patients using 20 mg of PROPULSID  (r)  than in patients using 10 mg.



 Additional adverse experiences reported to occur in 1% or less of patients in the U.S. clinical studies are: dry mouth, somnolence, palpitation, migraine, tremor and edema.



 In other U.S. and international trials and in postmarketing experience, there have been rare reports of seizures and extrapyramidal effects. Also reported have been tachycardia, elevated liver enzymes, hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, aplastic anemia, pancytopenia and granulocytopenia. The relationship of PROPULSID  (r)  to the event was not clear in these cases.



 Cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, torsades de pointes, and QT prolongation, in some cases resulting in death, have been reported. (See    CONTRAINDICATIONS    ,    WARNINGS    ,    PRECAUTIONS and Drug Interactions.    )



   Ongoing Postmarketing Surveillance: Serious cardiac arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, torsades de pointes, and QT prolongation have been reported in patients taking PROPULSID    (r)    . From July 1993 through May 1999, more than 270 such cases have been spontaneously reported, including 70 fatalities. In approximately 85% of these cases the events occurred when PROPULSID    (r)    was used in patients with known risk factors. These risk factors included the administration of other drugs which caused QT prolongation, inhibited the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzymes that metabolize cisapride, or depleted serum electrolytes; or the presence of disorders that may have predisposed patients to arrhythmias. In approximately 0.7% of these cases, the events occurred in the absence of identified risk factors; in the remaining cases, risk factor status was unknown. Because the cases were reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of adverse event frequency cannot be made.  (See    Boxed Warning    ,    CONTRAINDICATIONS    ,    WARNINGS    ,    PRECAUTIONS and Drug Interactions.    ) PROPULSID  (r)  -induced serious ventricular arrhythmias and death may not correlate with the degree of drug-induced prolongation of the QT interval detected by 12-lead ECG.



 In addition to the cardiovascular adverse events, the following events have been identified during post-approval use of PROPULSID  (r)  in clinical practice. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion in this insert due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to PROPULSID  (r)  : allergic reactions, including bronchospasm, urticaria, and angioedema; possible exacerbation of asthma; psychiatric events, including confusion, depression, suicide attempt, and hallucinations; extrapyramidal effects including akathisia, Parkinson-like symptoms, dyskinetic and dystonic reactions; gynecomastia, female breast enlargement, urinary incontinence, hyperprolactinemia and galactorrhea.



 The following events were specifically reported in the pediatric population: antinuclear antibody (ANA) positive, anemia, hemolytic anemia, methemoglobinemia, hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia with acidosis, unexplained apneic episodes, confusion, impaired concentration, depression, apathy, visual changes accompanied by amnesia, and severe photosensitivity reaction.



 There have been rare cases of sinus tachycardia reported. Rechallenge precipitated the tachycardia again in some of those patients.

    BOXED WARNING: Warning:

  Warning:

    Serious cardiac arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, torsades de pointes, and QT prolongation have been reported in patients taking PROPULSID    (r)  .    From July 1993 through May 1999, more than 270 such cases have been spontaneously reported, including 70 fatalities.  In approximately 85% of these cases the events occurred when PROPULSID    (r)    was used in patients with known risk factors.  These risk factors included the administration of other drugs which caused QT prolongation, inhibited the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzymes that metabolize cisapride, or depleted serum electrolytes; or the presence of disorders that may have predisposed patients to arrhythmias.  In approximately 0.7% of these cases, the events occurred in the absence of identified risk factors; in the remaining cases, risk factor status was unknown.    Because the cases were reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of adverse event frequency cannot be made. (See     CONTRAINDICATIONS    ,     WARNINGS    ,     PRECAUTIONS and Drug Interactions.    )



 Numerous drug classes and agents increase the risk of developing serious cardiac arrhythmias.  PROPULSID  (r)   is contraindicated in patients taking certain   macrolide antibiotics   (such as clarithromycin, erythromycin, and troleandomycin), certain   antifungals   (such as fluconazole, itraconazole, and ketoconazole),   protease inhibitors   (such as indinavir and ritonavir),   phenothiazines   (such as prochlorperazine and promethazine),   Class IA and Class III antiarrhythmics   (such as quinidine, procainamide, and sotalol);   tricyclic antidepressants   (such as amitriptyline); certain   antidepressants   (such as nefazodone and maprotiline); certain   antipsychotic medications   (such as sertindole), as well as   other agents   (such as bepridil, sparfloxacin, and grapefruit juice).  (See     PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions.    )    The preceding list is not comprehensive.  



   QT prolongation, torsades de pointes (sometimes with syncope), cardiac arrest and sudden death have been reported in patients taking PROPULSID    (r)    without the above-mentioned contraindicated drugs.    Most patients had disorders that may have predisposed them to arrhythmias with PROPULSID  (r)  .  These include history of prolonged electrocardiographic QT intervals or known family history of congenital long QT syndrome; history of ventricular arrhythmias, ischemic or valvular heart disease; other structural heart defects; cardiomyopathy; congestive heart failure; clinically significant bradycardia; sinus node dysfunction; second or third degree atrioventricular block; respiratory failure; or conditions that result in electrolyte disorders (hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia), such as severe dehydration, vomiting, or malnutrition; eating disorders; renal failure; or the administration of potassium-wasting diuretics or insulin in acute settings. PROPULSID  (r)   is contraindicated in patients with these conditions.



 A 12-lead ECG should be performed prior to administration of PROPULSID  (r)  .  Treatment with PROPULSID  (r)   should not be initiated if the QTc value exceeds 450 milliseconds.  Serum electrolytes (potassium, calcium, and magnesium) and creatinine should be assessed prior to administration of PROPULSID  (r)   and whenever conditions develop that may affect electrolyte balance or renal function.  (See     DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.    )



 If syncope, rapid or irregular heartbeat develop, patients should immediately stop taking PROPULSID  (r)   and seek the attention of a physician.



   Recommended doses of PROPULSID    (r)    should not be exceeded.  
</Section>
    <Section id="S3" name="precautions">    PRECAUTIONS



   General:



  Potential benefits should be weighed against risks prior to administration of PROPULSID  (r)  (cisapride) to patients who have conditions that could predispose them to the development of serious arrhythmias, such as multiple organ failure, COPD, apnea and advanced cancer. (See   CONTRAINDICATIONS.    )



    Information for Patients:



  Patients should be warned against concomitant use of promethazine (Phenergan  (r)  ), bepridil (Vascor  (r)  ), quinidine (such as Quinidex  (r)  , Cardioquin  (r)  , Quinaglute  (r)  ), procainamide (Procanbid  (r)  ), sotalol (Betapace  (r)  ), erythromycin (such as E.E.S.  (r)  , E-Mycin  (r)  , Ilotycin  (r)  , Pediazole  (r)  ), clarithromycin (Biaxin  (r)  ), troleandomycin (TAO  (r)  ), sparfloxacin (Zagam  (r)  ), amitriptyline (Elavil  (r)  ), maprotiline (Ludiomil  (r)  ), nefazodone (Serzone  (r)  ), fluconazole (Diflucan  (r)  ), itraconazole (Sporanox  (r)  ), ketoconazole (Nizoral  (r)  ), prochlorperazine (Compazine  (r)  ), sertindole, indinavir (Crixivan  (r)  ), ritonavir (Norvir  (r)  ) and warfarin (Coumadin  (r)  ). (See   Drug Interactions.    ) The preceding list is not comprehensive.  



 Recommended doses should not be exceeded.



 Patients should be advised to stop PROPULSID  (r)  and seek medical attention if they faint or become faint, dizzy, experience an irregular heartbeat or pulse, or any other unusual symptoms while using PROPULSID  (r)  .



 Patients should be questioned about concomitant medication use. Patients taking PROPULSID  (r)  should also be advised to inform their physician when new medications are prescribed.



 Patients should be advised to refrain from consuming grapefruit juice for the duration of their PROPULSID  (r)  therapy.



 Although PROPULSID  (r)  does not affect psychomotor function nor does it induce sedation or drowsiness when used alone, patients should be advised that the sedative effects of benzodiazepines and of alcohol may be enhanced by PROPULSID  (r)  .



 Patients should be advised that generally the following lifestyle changes should be tried before using any drug for nighttime heartburn, including PROPULSID  (r)  : avoiding alcohol, quitting/decreasing cigarette smoking, elevating the head of the bed, avoiding large meals/meals just before bedtime, losing weight, avoiding fatty foods, chocolate, caffeine, or citrus.



 Patients should be given the Medication Guide for additional information.



    Drug Interactions:



  Cisapride is metabolized mainly via the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme. In some cases where serious ventricular arrhythmias, QT prolongation, and torsades de pointes have occurred when PROPULSID  (r)  was taken in conjunction with one of the cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors, elevated blood cisapride levels were noted at the time of the QT prolongation.



    Antibiotics:



   In vitro  and/or in vivo  data show that clarithromycin, erythromycin  and troleandomycin  markedly inhibit the metabolism of PROPULSID  (r)  , which can result in an increase in plasma cisapride levels and prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG.



    Anticholinergics:



  Concurrent administration of certain anticholinergic compounds, such as belladonna alkaloids and dicyclomine, would be expected to compromise the beneficial effects of PROPULSID  (r)  .



    Anticoagulants (oral):



  In patients receiving oral anticoagulants, the coagulation times were increased in some cases. It is advisable to check coagulation time within the first few days after the start and discontinuation of PROPULSID  (r)  therapy, with an appropriate adjustment of the anticoagulant dose, if necessary.



    Antidepressants:



   In vitro  data indicate that nefazodone  inhibits the metabolism of PROPULSID  (r)  , which can result in an increase in plasma cisapride levels and prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG.



    Antifungals:



   In vitro  and/or in vivo  data indicate that fluconazole  , itraconazole  and oral ketoconazole  markedly inhibit the metabolism of PROPULSID  (r)  , which can result in an increase in plasma cisapride levels and prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG. Human pharmacokinetic data indicate that oral ketoconazole markedly inhibits the metabolism of cisapride, resulting in a mean eight-fold increase in AUC of cisapride. A study in 14 normal male and female volunteers suggests that coadministration of PROPULSID  (r)  and ketoconazole can result in prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG.



    Diuretics:



  Drugs such as furosemide and the thiazides are associated with depletion of electrolytes which may result in PROPULSID  (r)  -induced cardiac arrhythmias. Serum electrolytes should be assessed in diuretic-treated patients before initiating PROPULSID  (r)  therapy and periodically thereafter. PROPULSID  (r)  -treated patients to whom diuretic therapy is added should undergo careful electrolyte monitoring after diuretic initiation.



    H2receptor antagonists:



   Cimetidine  coadministration leads to an increased peak plasma concentration and AUC of PROPULSID  (r)  ; there is no effect on PROPULSID  (r)  absorption when it is coadministered with ranitidine  . The gastrointestinal absorption of cimetidine and ranitidine is accelerated when they are coadministered with PROPULSID  (r)  .



    Protease inhibitors:



   In vitro  data indicate that indinavir  and ritonavir  markedly inhibit the metabolism of PROPULSID  (r)  which can result in an increase in plasma cisapride levels and prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG.



    Other:



  Co-administration of grapefruit juice with PROPULSID  (r)  increases the bioavailability of cisapride by an average of 50%. Patients on PROPULSID  (r)  should refrain from consuming grapefruit juice for the duration of their PROPULSID  (r)  therapy.



 PROPULSID  (r)  should not be used concomitantly with other drugs known to prolong the QT interval: certain antiarrhythmics, including those of Class IA (such as quinidine and procainamide) and Class III (such as sotalol); tricyclic antidepressants (such as amitriptyline); certain tetracyclic antidepressants (such as maprotiline); certain antipsychotic medications (such as sertindole); bepridil, and sparfloxacin. The preceding lists are not comprehensive.  



 The acceleration of gastric emptying by PROPULSID  (r)  could affect the rate of absorption of other drugs. Patients receiving narrow therapeutic ratio drugs or other drugs that require careful titration should be followed closely; if plasma levels are being monitored, they should be reassessed.



    Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility:



  In a twenty-five month oral carcinogenicity study in rats, cisapride at daily doses up to 80 mg/kg was not tumorigenic. For a 50 kg person of average height (1.46 m  2  body surface area), this dose represents 50 times the maximum recommended human dose (1.6 mg/kg/day) on a mg/kg basis and 7 times the maximum recommended human dose (54.4 mg/m  2  ) on a body surface area basis. In a nineteen month oral carcinogenicity study in mice, cisapride at daily doses up to 80 mg/kg was not tumorigenic. This dose represents 50 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/kg basis and about 4 times the maximum recommended human dose on a body surface area basis.



 Cisapride was not mutagenic in the in vitro  Ames test, human lymphocyte chromosomal aberration test, mouse lymphoma cell forward mutation test, and rat hepatocyte UDS test and in vivo  rat micronucleus test, male and female mouse dominant lethal mutations tests, and sex linked recessive lethal test in male Drosophila melanogaster  .



 Fertility and reproductive performance studies were conducted in male and female rats. Cisapride was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male rats at oral doses up to 160 mg/kg/day (100 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/kg basis and 14 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m  2  basis). In the female rats, cisapride at oral doses of 40 mg/kg/day and higher prolonged the breeding interval required for impregnation. Similar effects were also observed at maturity in the female offspring (F1) of the female rats (F0) treated with oral doses of cisapride at 10 mg/kg/day or higher. Cisapride at an oral dose of 160 mg/kg/day also exerted contragestational/pregnancy disrupting effects in female rats (F0).



    Pregnancy: Teratogenic effects: Pregnancy category C:



  Oral teratology studies have been conducted in rats (doses up to 160 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (doses up to 40 mg/kg/day). There was no evidence of a teratogenic potential of cisapride in rats or rabbits. Cisapride was embryotoxic and fetotoxic in rats at a dose of 160 mg/kg/day (100 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/kg basis and 14 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m  2  basis) and in rabbits at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day (approximately 12 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/kg basis) or higher. It also produced reduced birth weights of pups in rats at 40 and 160 mg/kg/day and adversely affected the pup survival. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Cisapride should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the mother and the fetus.



    Nursing Mothers:



  Cisapride is excreted in human milk at concentrations approximately one twentieth of those observed in plasma. Caution should be exercised when PROPULSID  (r)  is administered to a nursing woman, and particular care must be taken if the nursing infant or the mother is taking a drug that might alter PROPULSID  (r)  's metabolism in the infant. (See   CONTRAINDICATIONS    ,   WARNINGS    ,   PRECAUTIONS and Drug Interactions.    )



    Pediatric Use:



  Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients under the age of 16 years have not been established for any indication. Although causality has not been established, serious adverse events, including death, have been reported in infants and children treated with PROPULSID  (r)  . Several pediatric deaths were due to cardiovascular events (third degree heart block and ventricular tachycardia). Pediatric deaths have been associated with seizures and there has been at least one case of "sudden unexplained death" in a 3-month-old infant. Other unlabeled potentially serious events which have been reported in pediatric patients include: antinuclear antibody (ANA) positive, anemia, hemolytic anemia, methemoglobinemia, hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia with acidosis, unexplained apneic episodes, confusion, impaired concentration, depression, apathy, visual changes accompanied by amnesia, and severe photosensitivity reaction. (See   OVERDOSAGE.    )



    Geriatric Use:



  Steady-state plasma levels are generally higher in older than in younger patients, due to a moderate prolongation of the elimination half-life. Therapeutic doses, however, are similar to those used in younger adults.



 The rate of common adverse experiences in patients greater than 65 years of age in clinical trials was similar to that in younger adults.

  PROPULSID  (r)  (cisapride) undergoes metabolism mainly by the hepatic cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme. Drugs which inhibit this enzyme can lead to elevated cisapride blood levels. (See   PRECAUTIONS and Drug Interactions.    )



 Numerous cases of serious cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular arrhythmias and torsades de pointes associated with QT prolongation, have been reported in patients taking PROPULSID  (r)  alone or with the drugs listed above, or with disorders that may have predisposed them to arrhythmias. Some of these patients did not have cardiac disease; however, most had been receiving multiple other medications and had pre-existing cardiac disease or risk factors for arrhythmias. Some of these cases have been fatal. (See   Boxed Warning.    )
