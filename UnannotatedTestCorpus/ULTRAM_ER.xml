  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 ULTRAM ER was administered to a total of 3108 patients during studies conducted in the U.S. These included four double-blind studies in patients with osteoarthritis and/or chronic low back pain and one open-label study in patients with chronic non-malignant pain. A total of 901 patients were 65 years or older. The frequency of adverse reactions generally increased with doses from 100 mg to 400 mg in the two pooled, twelve-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in patients with chronic non-malignant pain (see Table 1). The most common adverse reactions from Table 1 occurring in &gt;=10% and &gt;=2 x placebo rate of the patients treated with ULTRAM ER are dizziness (not vertigo), nausea, constipation, headache, somnolence, flushing, pruritus, vomiting, insomnia, and dry mouth.

   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of tramadol. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Serotonin syndrome  : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs.



   Adrenal insufficiency  : Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use.



   Anaphylaxis  : Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in ULTRAM ER.



   Androgen deficiency  : Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with chronic use of opioids  [see Clinical Pharmacology (  12.2  )]  .



   QT prolongation/torsade de pointes:  Cases of QT prolongation and/or torsade de pointes have been reported with tramadol use. Many of these cases were reported in patients taking another drug labeled for QT prolongation, in patients with a risk factor for QT prolongation (e.g., hypokalemia), or in overdose setting.

      Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse     



   ULTRAM ER exposes patients and other users to the risks of opioid addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess each patient's risk prior to prescribing ULTRAM ER, and monitor all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors and conditions   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )]  .   



     Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression     



   Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of ULTRAM ER.  Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of ULTRAM ER or following a dose increase. Instruct patients to swallow ULTRAM ER tablets intact, and not to cut, break, chew, crush, or dissolve the tablets to avoid exposure to a potentially fatal dose of tramadol     [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )].     



     Accidental Ingestion     



   Accidental ingestion of even one dose of ULTRAM ER, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of tramadol   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )]  .  



     Ultra-Rapid Metabolism Of Tramadol And Other Risk Factors For Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression In Children     



   Life-threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received tramadol. Some of the reported cases followed tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy; in at least one case, the child had evidence of being an ultra-rapid metabolizer of tramadol due to a CYP2D6 polymorphism   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  )]  . ULTRAM ER is contraindicated in children younger than 12 years of age and in children younger than 18 years of age following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy   [see Contraindications (  4  )].   Avoid the use of ULTRAM ER in adolescents 12 to 18 years of age who have other risk factors that may increase their sensitivity to the respiratory depressant effects of tramadol.   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  )]    



     Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome     



   Prolonged use of ULTRAM ER during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts.  If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.4  )]  .   



     Interactions with Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes    



   The effects of concomitant use or discontinuation of cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, 3A4 inhibitors, or 2D6 inhibitors with tramadol are complex.  Use of cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, 3A4 inhibitors, or 2D6 inhibitors with   ULTRAM ER   requires careful consideration of the effects on the parent drug, tramadol, and the active metabolite, M1   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.5  ), Drug Interactions (  7  )]  .  



     Risks From Concomitant Use With Benzodiazepines Or Other CNS Depressants    



   Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death   [  see   Warnings and Precautions (  5.6  ), Drug Interactions (  7  )]  .   



 *  Reserve concomitant prescribing of ULTRAM ER Injection and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. 
 *  Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. 
 *  Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.

   5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse



   ULTRAM ER contains tramadol, a Schedule IV controlled substance. As an opioid, ULTRAM ER exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Because extended-release products such as ULTRAM ER deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of tramadol present [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (       9   )].    



  Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed ULTRAM ER. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused.  



  Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing ULTRAM ER, and monitor all patients receiving ULTRAM ER for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as ULTRAM ER, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of ULTRAM ER along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse.  



  Abuse or misuse of ULTRAM ER by cutting, breaking, chewing, crushing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product will result in the uncontrolled delivery of tramadol and can result in overdose and death [see Overdosage (       10   )].    



  Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing ULTRAM ER. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [ see Patient Counseling Information (       17   )].     Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.  



    5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression



   Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see Overdosage (       10   )].     Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.  



  While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of ULTRAM ER, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24-72 hours of initiating therapy with and following dosage increases of ULTRAM ER.  



  To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of ULTRAM ER are essential [see Dosage and Administration (       2   )].     Overestimating the ULTRAM ER dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose.  



  Accidental ingestion of even one dose of ULTRAM ER, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of tramadol.  



    5.3 Ultra-Rapid Metabolism of Tramadol and Other Risk Factors for Life-threatening Respiratory Depression in Children



   Life-threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received tramadol. Tramadol and codeine are subject to variability in metabolism based upon CYP2D6 genotype (described below), which can lead to increased exposure to an active metabolite. Based upon postmarketing reports with tramadol or with codeine, children younger than 12 years of age may be more susceptible to the respiratory depressant effects of tramadol. Furthermore, children with obstructive sleep apnea who are treated with opioids for post-tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy pain may be particularly sensitive to their respiratory depressant effect. Because of the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression and death:  



   ULTRAM ER is contraindicated for all children younger than 12 years of age [see Contraindications (       4   )].    



   ULTRAM ER is contraindicated for post-operative management in pediatric patients younger than 18 years of age following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy [see Contraindications (       4   )].    



   Avoid the use of ULTRAM ER in adolescents 12 to 18 years of age who have other risk factors that may increase their sensitivity to the respiratory depressant effects of tramadol unless the benefits outweigh the risks. Risk factors include conditions associated with hypoventilation, such as postoperative status, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, severe pulmonary disease, neuromuscular disease, and concomitant use of other medications that cause respiratory depression.  



   As with adults, when prescribing opioids for adolescents, healthcare providers should choose the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time and inform patients and caregivers about these risks and the signs of opioid overdose [see Use in Specific Populations (       8.4   ), Overdosage (    10   )].    



  Nursing Mothers  



  Tramadol is subject to the same polymorphic metabolism as codeine, with ultra-rapid metabolizers of CYP2D6 substrates being potentially exposed to life-threatening levels of O-desmethyltramadol(M1). At least one death was reported in a nursing infant who was exposed to high levels of morphine in breast milk because the mother was an ultra-rapid metabolizer of codeine.  



  A baby nursing from an ultra-rapid metabolizer mother taking ULTRAM ER could potentially be exposed to high levels of M1, and experience life-threatening respiratory depression. For this reason, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ULTRAM ER [see Use in Specific Populations (       8.2   )].    



  CYP2D6 Genetic Variability: Ultra-rapid metabolizer  



  Some individuals may be ultra-rapid metabolizers because of a specific CYP2D6 genotype (e.g., gene duplications denoted as *1/*1xN or *1/*2xN). The prevalence of this CYP2D6 phenotype varies widely and has been estimated at 1 to 10% for Whites (European, North American), 3 to 4% for Blacks (African Americans), 1 to 2% for East Asians (Chinese, Japanese, Korean), and may be greater than 10% in certain racial/ethnic groups (i.e., Oceanian, Northern African, Middle Eastern, Ashkenazi Jews, Puerto Rican). These individuals convert tramadol into its active metabolite, O-desmethyltramadol (M1), more rapidly and completely than other people. This rapid conversion results in higher than expected serum M1 levels. Even at labeled dosage regimens, individuals who are ultra-rapid metabolizers may have life-threatening or fatal respiratory depression or experience signs of overdose (such as extreme sleepiness, confusion, or shallow breathing) [see Overdosage (       10   )].     Therefore, individuals who are ultra-rapid metabolizers should not use ULTRAM ER.  



    5.4 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome



   Prolonged use of ULTRAM ER during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Use in Specific Populations (       8.1   ), Patient Counseling Information (    17   )].    



    5.5 Risks of Interactions with Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes



   The effects of concomitant use or discontinuation of cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, 3A4 inhibitors, or 2D6 inhibitors on levels of tramadol and M1 from ULTRAM ER are complex. Use of cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, 3A4 inhibitors, or 2D6 inhibitors with ULTRAM ER requires careful consideration of the effects on the parent drug, tramadol which is a weak serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor and u-opioid agonist, and the active metabolite, M1, which is more potent than tramadol in u-opioid receptor binding [see Drug Interactions (       7   )].    



   Risks of Concomitant Use or Discontinuation of Cytochrome P450 2D6 Inhibitors    



  The concomitant use of ULTRAM ER with all cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibitors (e.g., amiodarone, quinidine) may result in an increase in tramadol plasma levels and a decrease in the levels of the active metabolite, M1. A decrease in M1 exposure in patients who have developed physical dependence to tramadol, may result in signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal and reduced efficacy. The effect of increased tramadol levels may be an increased risk for serious adverse events including seizures and serotonin syndrome.  



  Discontinuation of a concomitantly used cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibitor may result in a decrease in tramadol plasma levels and an increase in active metabolite M1 levels, which could increase or prolong adverse reactions related to opioid toxicity and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.  



  Follow patients receiving ULTRAM ER and any CYP2D6 inhibitor for the risk of serious adverse events including seizures and serotonin syndrome, signs and symptoms that may reflect opioid toxicity, and opioid withdrawal when ULTRAM ER are used in conjunction with inhibitors of CYP2D6 [see Drug Interactions (       7   )].    



   Cytochrome P450 3A4 Interaction    



  The concomitant use of ULTRAM ER with cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir) or discontinuation of a cytochrome P450 3A4 inducer such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may result in an increase in tramadol plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse reactions, increase the risk for serious adverse events including seizures and serotonin syndrome, and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.  



  The concomitant use of ULTRAM ER with all cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers or discontinuation of a cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitor may result in lower tramadol levels. This may be associated with a decrease in efficacy, and in some patients, may result in signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal.  



  Follow patients receiving ULTRAM ER and any CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer for the risk for serious adverse events including seizures and serotonin syndrome, signs and symptoms that may reflect opioid toxicity and opioid withdrawal when ULTRAM ER are used in conjunction with inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 [see Drug Interactions (       7   )].    



    5.6 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants



   Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of ULTRAM ER with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.  



  Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions (       7   )].    



  If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.  



  Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when ULTRAM ER is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [see Drug Interactions (       7   ), Patient Counseling Information (    17   )].    



    5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Risk



   Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported with the use of tramadol, including ULTRAM ER, particularly during concomitant use with serotonergic drugs. Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including MAO inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue) [see Drug Interactions (       7   )].     This may occur within the recommended dosage range.  



  Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days of concomitant use, but may occur later than that. Discontinue ULTRAM ER if serotonin syndrome is suspected  . 



    5.8 Increased Risk of Seizures



   Seizures have been reported in patients receiving tramadol within the recommended dosage range. Spontaneous post-marketing reports indicate that seizure risk is increased with doses of tramadol above the recommended range.  



  Concomitant use of tramadol increases the seizure risk in patients taking: [see Drug Interactions (       7   )]     .  



 *     Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and Serotonin-norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors (SNRIs) antidepressants or anorectics,  
 *     Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and other tricyclic compounds (e.g., cyclobenzaprine, promethazine, etc.),  
 *     Other opioids,  
 *     MAO inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (     5.7   ), Drug Interactions (   7   )]   
 *     Neuroleptics, or  
 *     Other drugs that reduce the seizure threshold.  
     Risk of seizures may also increase in patients with epilepsy, those with a history of seizures, or in patients with a recognized risk for seizure (such as head trauma, metabolic disorders, alcohol and drug withdrawal, CNS infections).  
 

  In tramadol overdose, naloxone administration may increase the risk of seizure.  



    5.9 Suicide Risk



    *    Do not prescribe ULTRAM ER for patients who are suicidal or addiction-prone. Consideration should be given to the use of non-narcotic analgesics in patients who are suicidal or depressed. [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (  9.2  )]  
 *    Prescribe ULTRAM ER with caution for patients with a history of misuse and/or are currently taking CNS-active drugs including tranquilizers, or antidepressant drugs, or alcohol in excess, and patients who suffer from emotional disturbance or depression [see Drug Interactions (  7  )].  
 *    Inform patients not to exceed the recommended dose and to limit their intake of alcohol [see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  ), Warnings and Precautions (  5.6  ,  5.7  ,  5.13  )].  
       5.10 Adrenal Insufficiency
 

   Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure.  If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids.  Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers.  Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency  .



    5.11 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients



   The use of ULTRAM ER in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated.  



   Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease  : ULTRAM ER -treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of ULTRAM ER [see Warnings and Precautions (       5.2   )].    



   Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients  : Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions (       5.2   )].    



  Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating ULTRAM ER and when ULTRAM ER is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (       5.2   ,    5.5   )].     Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients.  



    5.12 Severe Hypotension



   ULTRAM ER may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (       7   )].     Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of ULTRAM ER. In patients with circulatory shock, ULTRAM ER may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of ULTRAM ER in patients with circulatory shock.  



    5.13 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness



   In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), ULTRAM ER may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with ULTRAM ER.  



  Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of ULTRAM ER in patients with impaired consciousness or coma.  



    5.14 Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions



   ULTRAM ER is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus.  



  The tramadol in ULTRAM ER may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms.  



    5.15 Anaphylaxis and Other Hypersensitivity Reactions



   Serious and rarely fatal hypersensitive reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with tramadol. When these events do occur it is often following the first dose. Other reported hypersensitivity reactions include pruritus, hives, bronchospasm, angioedema, toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions to tramadol and other opioids may be at increased risk and therefore should not receive ULTRAM ER. If anaphylaxis or other hypersensitivity occurs, stop administration of ULTRAM ER immediately, discontinue ULTRAM ER permanently, and do not rechallenge with any formulation of tramadol. Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if they experience any symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction [see Patient Counseling Information (       17   )].    



    5.16 Withdrawal



   Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including ULTRAM ER. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms [see Drug Interactions (       7   )].    



  When discontinuing ULTRAM ER, gradually taper the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (       2.4   )].     Do not abruptly discontinue ULTRAM ER [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (       9.3  )].  



    5.17 Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery



   ULTRAM ER may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of ULTRAM ER and know how they will react to the medication [see Patient Counseling Information (       17   )].
