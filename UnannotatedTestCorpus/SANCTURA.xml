  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 The safety of SANCTURA  (r)  was evaluated in controlled clinical trials in a total of 2975 patients, who were treated with SANCTURA  (r)  (N=1673), placebo (N=1056) or active control medications (N=246). Of this total, 1181 patients participated in two, 12-week, U.S., efficacy and safety studies and a 9-month open-label extension. Of this total, 591 patients received SANCTURA  (r)  20 mg twice daily. In all controlled trials combined, 232 and 208 patients received treatment with SANCTURA  (r)  for at least 24 and 52 weeks, respectively.



 In all placebo-controlled trials combined, the incidence of serious adverse events was 2.9% among patients receiving SANCTURA  (r)  20 mg twice daily and 1.5% among patients receiving placebo.  Table 1  lists adverse reactions from the combined 12-week U.S. safety and efficacy trials were reported by at least 1% of patients, and were reported more frequently in the SANCTURA  (r)  group than in the placebo group.



 The two most common adverse reactions reported by patients receiving SANCTURA  (r)  20 mg twice daily were dry mouth and constipation. The single most frequently reported adverse reaction for SANCTURA  (r)  , dry mouth, occurred in 20.1% of SANCTURA  (r)  treated patients and 5.8% of patients receiving placebo. In the two U.S. studies, dry mouth led to discontinuation in 1.9% of patients treated with SANCTURA  (r)  20 mg twice daily. For the patients who reported dry mouth, most had their first occurrence of the event within the first month of treatment.

         Other adverse reactions from the U.S., placebo-controlled trials , occurring in greater than or equal to 0.5% and less than 1.0% of SANCTURA  (r)  treated patients, and more common with SANCTURA  (r)  than placebo are: tachycardia, vision blurred, abdominal distension, vomiting, dysgeusia, dry throat, and dry skin.
 

 During controlled clinical studies, one adverse reaction of angioneurotic edema was reported.



   6.2 Post-marketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of trospium chloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 Gastrointestinal - gastritis; Cardiovascular - palpitations, supraventricular tachycardia, chest pain, syncope, "hypertensive crisis"; Immunological - Stevens-Johnson syndrome, anaphylactic reaction, angioedema; Nervous System - dizziness, confusion, vision abnormal, hallucinations, somnolence and delirium; Musculoskeletal - rhabdomyolysis; General - rash.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  SANCTURA  (r)  should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction or gastrointestinal obstructive disorders due to risk of urinary or gastric retention. (  5.1  ,  5.3  ) 
 *  Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with trospium chloride. (  5.2  ) 
 *  In patients with controlled narrow angle glaucoma SANCTURA  (r)  should be used only with careful monitoring. (  5.4  ) 
 *  Central Nervous System Effects: Somnolence has been reported with SANCTURA  (r)  . Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how SANCTURA  (r)  affects them. (  5.5  ) 
    Trospium is substantially excreted by the kidney. The effects of moderate renal impairment on systemic exposure are not known but systemic exposure is likely increased. Therefore, the risk of anticholinergic adverse reactions is expected to be greater in patients with moderate renal impairment. (  5.6  )
 

 



   5.1 Risk of Urinary Retention



  SANCTURA  (r)  should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [ see Contraindications (  4  )  ].



    5.2 Angioedema



  Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx has been reported with trospium chloride, the active ingredient in SANCTURA  (r)  . In one case, angioedema occurred after the first dose of trospium chloride. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, SANCTURA  (r)  should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided.



    5.3 Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility



  SANCTURA  (r)  should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [ see Contraindications (  4  )  ]. SANCTURA  (r)  , like other antimuscarinic agents, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, intestinal atony and myasthenia gravis.



    5.4 Controlled Narrow-angle Glaucoma



  In patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma, SANCTURA  (r)  should only be used if the potential benefits outweigh the risks and in that circumstance only with careful monitoring [ see Contraindications (  4  )  ].



       5.5 Central Nervous System Effects



     SANCTURA  (r)  is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [ see Adverse Reactions (  6.2  )  ]. A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including dizziness, confusion, hallucinations and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how SANCTURA  (r)  affects them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered.



    5.6 Anticholinergic Adverse Reactions in Patients with Moderate Renal Impairment



  Trospium is substantially excreted by the kidney. The effects of moderate renal impairment on systemic exposure are not known, but systemic exposure is likely increased. Therefore, anticholinergic adverse reactions (including dry mouth, constipation, dyspepsia, urinary tract infection, and urinary retention) are expected to be greater in patients with moderate renal impairment [ see Dosage and Administration (  2  ), and Use in Specific Populations (  8.6  )  ].
