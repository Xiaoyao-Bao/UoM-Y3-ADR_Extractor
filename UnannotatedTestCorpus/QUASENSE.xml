   To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Actavis at 1-800-272-5525 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or        www.fda.gov/medwatch          .    



 

  6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 The clinical trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of QUASENSE was a 12-month, randomized, multicenter, open-label study, which enrolled women aged 18-40, of whom 456 took at least one dose of QUASENSE (345.14 woman-years of exposure) [  see Clinical Studies (  14  )  ].



   Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation:  14.9% of the women discontinued from the clinical trial due to an adverse reaction; the most common adverse reactions (&gt;= 1% of women) leading to discontinuation in the QUASENSE group were menorrhagia (5.7%), mood swings (1.9%), weight/appetite increase (1.5%), and acne (1.3%).



   Common Adverse Reactions (&gt;= 2% of women):  headache (20.6%), menorrhagia (11.6%), nausea (7.5%), dysmenorrhea (5.7%), acne (4.6%), migraine (4.4%), breast tenderness (3.5%), weight increased (3.1%), and depression (2.1%).



   Serious Adverse Reactions:  pulmonary embolus, cholecystitis.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of QUASENSE. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Gastrointestinal disorders:  abdominal distension, vomiting



   General disorders and administration site conditions:  chest pain, fatigue, malaise, edema peripheral, pain



   Immune system disorder:  hypersensitivity reactions, including itching, rash, and angioedema



   Investigations:   blood pressure increased



   Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders:  muscle spasms, pain in extremity



   Nervous system disorders:  dizziness, loss of consciousness



   Psychiatric disorders:  insomnia



   Reproductive and breast disorders:  dysmenorrhea



   Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:  alopecia



   Vascular disorders:  thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary thrombosis

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING:  CIGARETTE SMOKING AND SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS

    WARNING:  CIGARETTE SMOKING AND SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS  

    Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from combination oral contraceptive (COC) use. This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked. For this reason, COCs are contraindicated in women who are over 35 years of age and smoke [see Contraindications (  4  )].  



      



   EXCERPT:     WARNING:  CIGARETTE SMOKING AND SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS  



   See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.  



   QUASENSE is contraindicated in women over 35 years old who smoke. (  4  )  



   Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from combination oral contraceptive (COC) use. (  4  )

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Thrombotic disorders and other vascular problems: Stop QUASENSE if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (  5.1  ) 
 *  Liver disease: Discontinue QUASENSE if jaundice occurs. (  5.2  ) 
 *  High blood pressure: If used in women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop QUASENSE if blood pressure rises significantly. (  5.3  ) 
 *  Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking QUASENSE. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (  5.5  ) 
 *  Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue QUASENSE if indicated. (  5.6  ) 
 *  Bleeding irregularities and amenorrhea: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (  5.7  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Thrombotic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems



    *  Stop QUASENSE if an arterial thrombotic event or venous thromboembolic (VTE) event occurs. 
 *  Stop QUASENSE if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. 
 *  If feasible, stop QUASENSE at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of VTE as well as during and following prolonged immobilization. 
 *  Start QUASENSE no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum VTE decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. 
 *  The use of COCs increases the risk of VTE. However, pregnancy increases the risk of VTE as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of VTE in women using COCs is 3 to 9 cases per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of COCs and when restarting hormonal contraception after a break of 4 weeks or longer. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after use is discontinued. 
 *  Use of QUASENSE provides women with more hormonal exposure on a yearly basis than conventional monthly COCs containing the same strength synthetic estrogens and progestins (an additional 9 weeks of exposure per year). In the clinical trial, one case of pulmonary embolism was reported. Postmarketing adverse reactions of VTE have been reported in women who used QUASENSE. 
 *  Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. Stroke has been reported in women associated with the use of QUASENSE. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes). This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age who smoke. 
 *  Use COCs with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. 
       5.2 Liver Disease
 

   Impaired Liver Function  



 Do not use QUASENSE in women with liver disease, such as acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of the liver [ see Contraindications (  4  )  ]. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Discontinue QUASENSE if jaundice develops.



  Liver Tumors  



 QUASENSE is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [ see Contraindications (  4  )  ]. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage.



 Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (&gt; 8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users.



    5.3 Risk of Liver Enzyme Elevations with Concomitant Hepatitis C Treatment



   During clinical trials with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen that contains obmitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, ALT elevations greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), including some cases greater than 20 times the ULN, were significantly more frequent in women using ethinyl estradiol-containing medications, such as COCs. Discontinue QUASENSE prior to starting therapy with the combination drug regimen ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir [see Contraindications (  4  )]  . QUASENSE can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen.  



    5.4 High Blood Pressure



  QUASENSE is contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [ see Contraindications (  4  )  ]. For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop QUASENSE if blood pressure rises significantly.



 An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin.



    5.5 Gallbladder Disease



  Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. Use of COCs may worsen existing gallbladder disease.



 A past history of COC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use. Women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC-related cholestasis.



    5.6 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects



  Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking QUASENSE. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance.



 Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs.



 Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs.



    5.7 Headache



  If a woman taking QUASENSE develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue QUASENSE if indicated.



 Consider discontinuation of QUASENSE in the case of increased frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) [ see Contraindications (  4  )  ].



    5.8 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea



  Bleeding and/or spotting that occurs at any time while taking the first 84 tablets of each extended-cycle regimen is considered "unscheduled" bleeding/spotting. Bleeding that occurs during the time a woman takes the seven peach inert tablets is considered "scheduled" bleeding.



  Unscheduled and Scheduled Bleeding and Spotting  



 Unscheduled (breakthrough) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first 3 months of use. If unscheduled bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles on QUASENSE, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC.



 Before prescribing QUASENSE, advise the woman to weigh the convenience of fewer scheduled menses (4 per year instead of 13 per year) against the inconvenience of increased unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting.



 The clinical trial of the efficacy of QUASENSE (91-day cycles) in preventing pregnancy also assessed scheduled and unscheduled bleeding. The participants in the study were composed primarily of women who had used oral contraceptives previously as opposed to new users. Women with a history of breakthrough bleeding/spotting &gt;= 10 consecutive days on oral contraceptives were excluded from the study. More QUASENSE subjects, compared to subjects on the comparator 28-day cycle regimen, discontinued prematurely for unacceptable bleeding (7.7% [QUASENSE] vs. 1.8% [28-day cycle regimen]).



 Unscheduled bleeding and unscheduled spotting decreased over successive 91-day cycles. Table 3 below presents the number of days with unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting for each respective 91-day cycle.



  Table 3: Number of Unscheduled Bleeding and/or Spotting Days per 91-day Cycle

           a  Based on spotting and/or bleeding on days 1-84 of a 91 day cycle in the QUASENSE subjects and days 1-21 of a 28 day cycle over 4 cycles in the 28-day dosing regimen.
 

 Total days of bleeding and/or spotting (scheduled plus unscheduled) were similar over one year of treatment for QUASENSE subjects and subjects on the 28-day cycle regimen.



  Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea  



 Women who are not pregnant and use QUASENSE may experience amenorrhea. Based on data from the clinical trial, amenorrhea occurred in approximately 0.8% of women during Cycle 1, 1.2% of women during Cycle 2, 3.7% of women during Cycle 3, and 3.4% of women during Cycle 4. Because women using QUASENSE will likely have scheduled bleeding only 4 times per year, rule out pregnancy at the time of any missed menstrual period.



 Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after stopping COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.



    5.9 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy



  Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned, when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Discontinue QUASENSE use if pregnancy is confirmed.



 Administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [ see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  )  ].



    5.10 Depression



  Depression associated with the use of QUASENSE has been reported. Carefully observe women with a history of depression and discontinue QUASENSE if severe depression recurs.



    5.11 Carcinoma of the Breast and Cervix



    *  QUASENSE is contraindicated in women who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [ see Contraindications (  4  ) ].There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. 
 *  Some studies suggest that COC use has been associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 
       5.12 Effect on Binding Globulins
 

  The estrogen component of COCs may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, sex hormone-binding globulin and cortisol-binding globulin. The dose of replacement thyroid hormone or cortisol therapy may need to be increased.



    5.13 Monitoring



  A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated health care.



    5.14 Hereditary Angioedema



  In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema.



    5.15 Chloasma



  Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to develop chloasma should avoid prolonged exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking QUASENSE.
