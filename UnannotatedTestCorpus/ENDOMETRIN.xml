   This leaflet summarizes the most important information about ENDOMETRIN. To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Ferring Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-888-FERRING (1-888-337-7464) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.  



  



 

  6.1 Clinical Studies Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The safety data reflect exposure to ENDOMETRIN in 808 infertile women (74.9% White, 10.3% Hispanic, 5.4% Black, 5% Asian, and 4.6% Other) in a single Assisted Reproductive Technology 10 week clinical study conducted in the U.S. ENDOMETRIN was studied at doses of 100 mg twice daily and 100 mg three times daily. The adverse reactions that occurred at a rate greater than or equal to 2% in either ENDOMETRIN group are summarized in Table 1.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Life-threatening arterial or venous thromboembolic disorders may occur during hormone treatment, including treatment with ENDOMETRIN. Discontinue ENDOMETRIN if any of these are suspected. (  5.1  ) 
 *  Observe patients with a history of depression closely. Consider discontinuation if symptoms worsen. (  5.2  ) 
 *  ENDOMETRIN is not recommended for use with other vaginal products (such as antifungal products) as this may alter progesterone release and absorption from the vaginal insert. (  5.3  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Cardiovascular or Cerebrovascular Disorders



  The physician should be alert to earliest signs of myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disorders, arterial or venous thromboembolism (venous thromboembolism or pulmonary embolism), thrombophlebitis, or retinal thrombosis. ENDOMETRIN should be discontinued if any of these are suspected.



    5.2 Depression



  Patients with a history of depression need to be closely observed. Consider discontinuation if symptoms worsen.



    5.3 Use of Other Vaginal Products



  ENDOMETRIN should not be recommended for use with other vaginal products (such as antifungal products) as this may alter progesterone release and absorption from the vaginal insert [ see  Drug Interactions (7)    ].
