  6.1       Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 The data in Table 2 are derived from two placebo-controlled clinical studies in patients with chronic kidney disease and secondary hyperparathyroidism on hemodialysis. The data reflect exposure of 503 patients to PARSABIV with a mean duration of exposure to PARSABIV of 23.6 weeks. The mean age of patients was approximately 58 years, and 60% of the patients were male. Of the total patients, 67% were Caucasian, 28% were Black or African American, 2.6% were Asian, 1.2% were Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and 1.6% were categorized as Other. 



 Table 2 shows common adverse reactions associated with the use of PARSABIV in the pool of placebo-controlled studies. These adverse reactions occurred more commonly on PARSABIV than on placebo and were reported in at least 5% of patients treated with PARSABIV.

      Description of Selected Adverse Reactions  
 

   Hypocalcemia  



 In the combined placebo-controlled studies, a higher proportion of patients on PARSABIV developed at least one corrected serum calcium value below 7.0 mg/dL (7.6% PARSABIV, 3.1% placebo), below 7.5 mg/dL (27% PARSABIV, 5.5% placebo), and below 8.3 mg/dL (79% PARSABIV, 19% placebo). In the combined placebo-controlled studies, 1% of patients in the PARSABIV group and 0% of patients in the placebo group discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction attributed to a low corrected serum calcium.



   Hypophosphatemia  



 In the combined placebo-controlled studies, 18% of patients treated with PARSABIV and 8.2% of patients treated with placebo had at least one measured phosphorus level below the lower normal limit (i.e., 2.2 mg/dL).



   QTc    Interval    Prolongation    Secondary to Hypocalcemia       



 In the combined placebo-controlled studies, more patients treated with PARSABIV experienced a maximum increase from baseline of greater than 60 msec in the QTcF interval (0% placebo versus 1.2% PARSABIV). The patient incidence of maximum post-baseline predialysis QTcF &gt; 500 msec in the placebo and PARSABIV groups was 1.9% and 4.8%, respectively.



   Hypersensitivity  



 In the combined placebo-controlled studies, the subject incidence of adverse reactions potentially related to hypersensitivity was 4.4% in the PARSABIV group and 3.7% in the placebo group. Hypersensitivity reactions in the PARSABIV group were pruritic rash, urticaria, and face edema.



   6.2       Immunogenicity

  As with all peptide therapeutics, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of anti-drug binding antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to etelcalcetide with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.



 In clinical studies, 7.1% (71 out of 995) of patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism treated with PARSABIV for up to 6 months tested positive for binding anti-etelcalcetide antibodies. Fifty-seven out of 71 had pre-existing anti-etelcalcetide antibodies.



 No evidence of altered pharmacokinetic profile, clinical response, or safety profile was associated with pre-existing or developing anti-etelcalcetide antibodies. If formation of anti-etelcalcetide     binding antibodies with a clinically significant effect is suspected, contact Amgen at 1-800-77-AMGEN (1-800-772-6436) to discuss antibody testing.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">     5         WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  



     EXCERPT:    *   Hypocalcemia  :  Sometimes severe. Severe hypocalcemia can cause paresthesias, myalgias, muscle spasms, seizures, QT prolongation, and ventricular arrhythmias. Patients predisposed to QT interval prolongation, ventricular arrhythmias, and seizures may be at increased risk and require close monitoring. Educate patients on the symptoms of hypocalcemia and advise them to contact a healthcare provider if they occur. (  5.1  )  
 *   Worsening Heart Failure:  Reductions in corrected serum calcium may be associated with congestive heart failure, however, a causal relationship to PARSABIV could not be completely excluded. Closely monitor patients for worsening signs and symptoms of heart failure. (  5.2  ) 
 *   Upper Gastrointestinal (GI) Bleeding:  Patients with risk factors for upper GI bleeding may be at increased risk. Monitor patients and promptly evaluate and treat any suspected GI bleeding. (  5.3  ) 
 *   Adynamic Bone: May develop if PTH levels are chronically suppressed. If PTH levels decrease below the recommended target range, the dose of PARSABIV should be reduced or discontinued. (  5.4  ) 
    
 

   5.1       Hypocalcemia



  PARSABIV lowers serum calcium [   see Adverse Reactions (     6.1     )   ]   and can lead to hypocalcemia, sometimes severe. Significant lowering of serum calcium can cause paresthesias, myalgias, muscle spasms, seizures, QT interval prolongation, and ventricular arrhythmia.



  QT   I   nterval   P   rolongation and   V   entricular   A   rrhythmia  



 In the combined placebo-controlled studies, more patients treated with PARSABIV experienced a maximum increase from baseline of greater than 60 msec in the QTcF interval (0% placebo versus 1.2% PARSABIV). In these studies, the incidence of a maximum post-baseline predialysis QTcF &gt; 500 msec in the placebo and PARSABIV groups was 1.9% and 4.8%, respectively  [see Adverse Reactions (     6.1     )]  . Patients with congenital long QT syndrome, history of QT interval prolongation, family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac death, and other conditions that predispose to QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia may be at increased risk for QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias if they develop hypocalcemia due to PARSABIV. Closely monitor corrected serum calcium and QT interval in patients at risk receiving PARSABIV.



  Seizures  



 Significant reductions in corrected serum calcium may lower the threshold for seizures. Patients with a history of seizure disorder may be at increased risk for seizures if they develop hypocalcemia due to PARSABIV. Monitor corrected serum calcium in patients with seizure disorders receiving PARSABIV.



 Concurrent administration of PARSABIV with another oral calcium-sensing receptor agonist could result in severe, life-threatening hypocalcemia. Patients switching from cinacalcet to PARSABIV should discontinue cinacalcet for at least 7 days prior to initiating PARSABIV  [   see       Dosage and Administration (     2.4     )   ]  . Closely monitor corrected serum calcium in patients receiving PARSABIV and concomitant therapies known to lower serum calcium.



 Measure corrected serum calcium prior to initiation of PARSABIV. Do not initiate in patients if the corrected serum calcium is less than the lower limit of normal. Monitor corrected serum calcium within 1 week after initiation or dose adjustment and every 4 weeks during treatment with PARSABIV  [   see    Dosage and Administration (     2.2     )   ]  . Educate patients on the symptoms of hypocalcemia, and advise them to contact a healthcare provider if they occur. 



 If corrected serum calcium falls below the lower limit of normal or symptoms of hypocalcemia develop, start or increase calcium supplementation (including calcium, calcium-containing phosphate binders, and/or vitamin D sterols or increases in dialysate calcium concentration). PARSABIV dose reduction or discontinuation of PARSABIV may be necessary  [   see Dosage and Administration (     2.2     )   ]  .



    5.2       Worsening Heart Failure



  In clinical studies with PARSABIV, cases of hypotension, congestive heart failure, and decreased myocardial performance have been reported. In clinical studies, heart failure requiring hospitalization occurred in 2% of PARSABIV-treated patients and 1% of placebo-treated patients. Reductions in corrected serum calcium may be associated with congestive heart failure, however, a causal relationship to PARSABIV could not be completely excluded. Closely monitor patients treated with PARSABIV for worsening signs and symptoms of heart failure.



    5.3       Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding



  In clinical studies, two patients treated with PARSABIV in 1253 patient-years of exposure had upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding noted at the time of death while no patient in the control groups in 384 patient-years of exposure had upper GI bleeding noted at the time of death. The exact cause of GI bleeding in these patients is unknown, and there were too few cases to determine whether these cases were related to PARSABIV.



 Patients with risk factors for upper GI bleeding (such as known gastritis, esophagitis, ulcers, or severe vomiting) may be at increased risk for GI bleeding while receiving PARSABIV treatment. Monitor patients for worsening of common GI adverse reactions of nausea and vomiting associated with PARSABIV [   see Adverse Reactions (     6.1     )   ]  and for signs and symptoms of GI bleeding and ulcerations during PARSABIV therapy. Promptly evaluate and treat any suspected GI bleeding.



    5.4       Adynamic Bone



  Adynamic bone may develop if PTH levels are chronically suppressed. If PTH levels decrease below the recommended target range, the dose of vitamin D sterols and/or PARSABIV should be reduced or therapy discontinued. After discontinuation, resume therapy at a lower dose to maintain PTH levels in the target range [   see Dosage and Administration (     2.1     )   ]  .
