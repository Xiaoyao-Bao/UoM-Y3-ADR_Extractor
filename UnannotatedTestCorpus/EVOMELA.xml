      6.1 Clinical Trials Experience
   Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of Evomela may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The most common adverse reactions observed in at least 50% of patients with multiple myeloma treated with Evomela were neutrophil count decreased, white blood cell count decreased, lymphocyte count decreased, platelet count decreased, diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, hypokalemia, anemia, and vomiting.



   Myeloablative Conditioning in Multiple Myeloma Patients Undergoing ASCT  



 The safety of Evomela was evaluated in 61 patients with multiple myeloma in a single arm clinical trial in which patients were administered Evomela at a dosage of 100 mg/m  2  /day administered over ~30 minutes (range: 24-48 minutes) by intravenous (IV) infusion for 2 consecutive days (Day -3 and Day -2) prior to autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT, Day 0).



 Table 1 summarizes the adverse reactions from the single-arm trial in patients with multiple myeloma. Severe myelosuppression is expected and these adverse reactions are not listed below.

             Serious Adverse Reactions    
 

 Twelve (20%) patients experienced a treatment emergent serious adverse reaction while on study. The most common serious adverse reactions (&gt;1 patient, 1.6%) were pyrexia, hematochezia, febrile neutropenia, and renal failure. Treatment-related serious adverse reactions reported in &gt;1 patient were pyrexia (n=2, 3%), febrile neutropenia (n=2, 3%), and hematochezia (n=2, 3%).



     Palliative Treatment of Patients with Multiple Myeloma    



 The safety of melphalan was evaluated in 295 patients with multiple myeloma in the randomized clinical trial. One hundred and ninety-five patients were administered IV melphalan at a dosage of 16 mg/m  2  q 2 weeks x 4 (over 6 weeks) followed by the same dose every 4 weeks. One hundred patients were administered oral melphalan at a dosage of 0.15 mg/kg/day x 7 followed by 0.05 mg/kg/day when WBC counts began to rise.



 Severe myelotoxicity (WBC &lt;=1,000 and/or platelets &lt;=25,000) was more common in the IV melphalan arm (28%) than in the oral melphalan arm (11%).



 An association was noted between poor renal function and myelosuppression; consequently, an amendment to the protocol required a 50% reduction in IV melphalan dose if the BUN was &gt;=30 mg/dL. The rate of severe leukopenia in the IV arm in the patients with BUN over 30 mg/dL decreased from 50% (8/16) before protocol amendment to 11% (3/28) after the amendment.



 Before the dosing amendment, there was a 10% (8/77) incidence of drug-related death in the IV arm. After the dosing amendment, this incidence was 3% (3/108). This compares to an overall 1% (1/100) incidence of drug-related death in the oral melphalan arm.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: SEVERE BONE MARROW SUPPRESSION, HYPERSENSITIVITY, and LEUKEMOGENICITY

  WARNING: SEVERE BONE MARROW SUPPRESSION, HYPERSENSITIVITY, and LEUKEMOGENICITY

    *  Severe bone marrow suppression with resulting infection or bleeding may occur. Controlled trials comparing intravenous (IV) melphalan to oral melphalan have shown more myelosuppression with the IV formulation. Monitor hematologic laboratory parameters. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] 
 *  Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have occurred in approximately 2% of patients who received the IV formulation of melphalan. Discontinue treatment with Evomela for serious hypersensitivity reactions. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] 
 *  Melphalan produces chromosomal aberrations in vitro and in vivo. Evomela should be considered potentially leukemogenic in humans. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *    Gastrointestinal toxicity: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or oral mucositis may occur; provide supportive care using antiemetic and antidiarrheal medications as needed. (  2.1  ,  5.2  ) 
 *    Embryo-fetal toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise of potential risk to fetus and to avoid pregnancy. (  5.6  ,  8.1  ,  8.3  ) 
 *    Infertility: Melphalan may cause ovarian function suppression or testicular suppression. (  5.7  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Bone Marrow Suppression



  For patients receiving Evomela as part of a conditioning regimen, myeloablation occurs in all patients. Do not begin the conditioning regimen if a stem cell product is not available for rescue. Monitor complete blood counts, provide supportive care for infections, anemia and thrombocytopenia until there is adequate hematopoietic recovery.



 For patients receiving Evomela as palliative treatment, if the bone marrow has been compromised by prior irradiation, prior chemotherapy or is recovering from chemotherapy, the risk of severe myelosuppression with Evomela is increased. Perform periodic complete blood counts during the course of treatment with Evomela. Provide supportive care for infections, bleeding, and symptomatic anemia [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )].  



    5.2 Gastrointestinal Toxicity



  For patients receiving Evomela as part of a conditioning regimen, nausea, vomiting, mucositis, and diarrhea may occur in over 50% of patients. Use prophylactic antiemetic medication. Provide supportive care for nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and mucositis. The frequency of grade 3/4 mucositis in clinical studies was 13%. Provide nutritional support and analgesics for patients with severe mucositis. [see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  ) and Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  .



 For patients receiving Evomela as palliative treatment, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, and oral ulceration may occur. Use prophylactic antiemetics. Provide supportive care for nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and mucositis.



    5.3 Hepatotoxicity



  Hepatic disorders ranging from abnormal liver function tests to clinical manifestations such as hepatitis and jaundice have been reported after treatment with melphalan. Hepatic veno-occlusive disease has also been reported. Monitor liver chemistries.



    5.4 Hypersensitivity



  Acute hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have occurred in approximately 2% of patients who received an intravenous formulation of melphalan. Symptoms may include urticaria, pruritus, edema, and skin rashes and, in some patients, tachycardia, bronchospasm, dyspnea, and hypotension. Discontinue treatment with Evomela for serious hypersensitivity reactions.



    5.5 Secondary Malignancies



  Melphalan has been shown to cause chromatid or chromosome damage in humans. Secondary malignancies such as myeloproliferative syndrome or acute leukemia have been reported in multiple myeloma patients treated with melphalan-containing chemotherapy regimens. The potential benefit of Evomela therapy must be considered against the possible risk of the induction of a secondary malignancy.



    5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  Based on its mechanism of action, Evomela can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Melphalan is genotoxic, targets actively dividing cells, and was embryolethal and teratogenic in rats. Advise females of reproductive potential to avoid pregnancy during and after treatment with Evomela. If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, advise the patient of potential risk to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  ,  8.3  )]  .



    5.7 Infertility



  Melphalan-based chemotherapy regimens have been reported to cause suppression of ovarian function in premenopausal women, resulting in persistent amenorrhea in approximately 9% of patients. Reversible or irreversible testicular suppression has also been reported [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.3  )].
