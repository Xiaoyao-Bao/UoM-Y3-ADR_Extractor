  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     Combination Therapy in Newly-Diagnosed De Novo CD33-positive AML  



 The safety evaluation of MYLOTARG (3 mg/m  2  Day 1, 4 and 7 in combination with daunorubicin and cytarabine [DA]) in adults is based on data from ALFA-0701 for 131 patients treated with MYLOTARG plus DA and in 137 patients treated with DA alone  [see  Clinical Studies (14.1)  ].  In this study, 123 patients received all 3 fractionated doses of MYLOTARG and 7 patients missed at least 1 dose, with a mean total dose administered during induction of 14.51 mg (range: 4.6-18.0). MYLOTARG was received by 91 (70%) patients in the MYLOTARG arm during Consolidation 1 and 64 (49%) patients in the MYLOTARG arm during Consolidation 2.



 Safety data consisting of selected TEAEs considered most important for understanding the safety profile of MYLOTARG as well as all adverse events (AEs) that led to the permanent discontinuation of treatment were retrospectively collected. The selected TEAEs consisted of all grades hemorrhages, all grades VOD, and severe infections.



 Discontinuation due to any adverse reaction occurred in 31% of patients in the MYLOTARG arm versus 7% in the DA arm. The most frequent (greater than or equal to 1%) adverse reactions for patients treated with MYLOTARG that led to permanent discontinuation were thrombocytopenia (15%), VOD (3%), and septic shock (2%).



 Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 8 patients (6%) in the MYLOTARG arm versus 3 patients (2%) in the DA arm. In the MYLOTARG arm, 3 patients died of VOD, 4 patients died of hemorrhage-related events (CNS hemorrhage, hemorrhagic shock), and 1 patient died of suspected cardiac cause. In the DA arm, 3 patients died of sepsis.

               Monotherapy for Newly-Diagnosed CD33-positive AML  
 

 The safety evaluation of MYLOTARG (6 mg/m  2  then 3 mg/m  2  , with 7 days between the doses) as monotherapy is based on a randomized, open-label, Phase 3 trial of MYLOTARG (N=118) versus best supportive care (BSC) (N=119) in patients with previously untreated AML who were considered ineligible for intensive chemotherapy in Study AML-19  [see  Clinical Studies (14.1)  ].  



 The overall incidence of any Grade adverse reactions reported in AML-19 was 87% in the MYLOTARG arm and 90% in the BSC arm. The incidence of Grade greater than or equal to 3 adverse reactions was 61% in the MYLOTARG arm and 68% in the BSC arm. Death due to any Adverse Event was reported in the MYLOTARG arm of 19 (17%) compared to the BSC arm of 23 (20%).

 The adverse reactions described in this section reflect exposure to MYLOTARG 3 mg/m  2  on Days 1, 4 and 7 as monotherapy in 57 patients with relapsed AML treated on MyloFrance-1  [see  Clinical Studies (14.1)  ]  . All 57 (100%) patients received the 3 planned doses of MYLOTARG.



 During the treatment period, Grade 3 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) that occurred in greater than 1% patients included sepsis (32%), fever (16%), rash (11%), pneumonia (7%), bleeding (7%), mucositis (4%), pain (4%), diarrhea (2%), headaches (2%), tachycardia (2%), and lung edema (2%). No Grade 4 toxicity was observed. All grade TEAEs that occurred in greater than 15% of patients included fever (79%), infection (42%), increased AST (40%), bleeding (23%), nausea and vomiting (21%), constipation (21%), mucositis (21%), headache (19%), increased ALT (16%), and rash (16%). No infectious deaths occurred. Grade 1 or 2 hyperbilirubinemia developed in 4 (7%) patients. No episodes of VOD occurred. Seven patients received HSCT after MYLOTARG treatment. Three patients received an allogeneic BMT and 4 patients were treated with autologous BMT. No patients developed VOD following HSCT.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse drug reactions have been identified during post-approval use of MYLOTARG. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



    Gastrointestinal Disorders:  Neutropenic colitis (including fatal events) 
 

   Infections and Infestations:  fungal lung infections including Pulmonary mycosis and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia; and bacterial infections including Stenotrophomonas infection



   Renal and Urinary Disorders:  Hemorrhagic cystitis  1  



   Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders:  Interstitial pneumonia  1  



   6.3 Immunogenicity

  As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. Immunogenicity of MYLOTARG was not studied in clinical trials using the recommended dose regimens.

</Section>
    <Section id="S3" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Infusion related reactions (including anaphylaxis): Premedicate with a corticosteroid, acetaminophen, and diphenhydramine. Monitor patients during and for at least 1 hour after the end of the infusion. Interrupt the infusion, administer steroids or antihistamines, or permanently discontinue treatment as necessary (  2.1  ,  5.2  , and  6  ). 
 *  Hemorrhage: Severe, including fatal, hemorrhage may occur when MYLOTARG is used at recommended doses. Monitor platelet counts frequently (  5.3  and  6.1  ). 
 *  Embryo-fetal toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and use of effective contraception (  5.6  ,  8.1  , and  8.3  ). 
    
 

   5.1 Hepatotoxicity, Including Veno-occlusive Liver Disease (VOD)



  Hepatotoxicity, including life-threatening and sometimes fatal hepatic VOD events, have been reported in patients receiving MYLOTARG as a single agent or as part of a combination chemotherapy regimen [see  Adverse Reactions (6)  ].  



 In ALFA-0701, VOD events were reported in 6/131 (5%) patients during or following treatment with MYLOTARG, or following later hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The median time from the MYLOTARG dose to onset of VOD was 9 days (range: 2-298 days), with 5 events occurring within 28 days of any dose of MYLOTARG and 1 event occurring greater than 28 days after the last dose of MYLOTARG. Three of the 6 VOD events were fatal. VOD was also reported in 2 patients in the control arm of ALFA-0701 after receiving MYLOTARG as a therapy for relapsed AML.



 In MyloFrance-1 (MYLOTARG 3 mg/m  2  on Days 1, 4 and 7), VOD events were reported in none of the 57 patients during or following treatment, or following HSCT after completion of MYLOTARG treatment.



 Based on an analysis across trials, the risk of VOD was higher in adult patients who received higher doses of MYLOTARG as monotherapy, in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment prior to receiving MYLOTARG, in patients treated with MYLOTARG after HSCT, and in patients who underwent HSCT after treatment with MYLOTARG. Patients who had moderate/severe hepatic impairment prior to treatment with MYLOTARG were 8.7 times more likely to develop VOD compared to patients without moderate/severe hepatic impairment at baseline. Patients treated with MYLOTARG for relapse after HSCT were 2.6 times more likely to develop VOD compared to patients without prior HSCT. Patients who underwent HSCT following MYLOTARG treatment were 2.9 times more likely to develop VOD after HSCT compared to patients without HSCT following MYLOTARG treatment. Although no relationship was found between VOD and time of HSCT relative to higher MYLOTARG monotherapy doses, the ALFA-0701 study recommended an interval of 2 months between the last dose of MYLOTARG and HSCT. In MyloFrance-1, no patients underwent HSCT within 3.5 months of MYLOTARG therapy.



 Assess ALT, AST, total bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase prior to each dose of MYLOTARG. After treatment with MYLOTARG, monitor frequently for signs and symptoms of VOD; these may include elevations in ALT, AST, total bilirubin, hepatomegaly (which may be painful), rapid weight gain, and ascites. Monitoring only total bilirubin may not identify all patients at risk of VOD. For patients who develop abnormal liver tests, more frequent monitoring of liver tests and clinical signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity is recommended. For patients who proceed to HSCT, monitor liver tests frequently during the post-HSCT period, as appropriate.



 Manage signs or symptoms of hepatic toxicity by dose interruption or discontinuation of MYLOTARG [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  . In patients who experience VOD, discontinue MYLOTARG and treat according to standard medical practice.



    5.2 Infusion-Related Reactions (Including Anaphylaxis)



  Life-threatening or fatal infusion related-reactions can occur during or within 24 hours following infusion of MYLOTARG [see  Adverse Reactions (6)  ]  . Signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions may include fever, chills, hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxia and respiratory failure.



 Premedicate prior to MYLOTARG infusion [see  Dosage and Administration (2.1)  ]  . Monitor vital signs frequently during infusion. Interrupt infusion immediately for patients who develop evidence of infusion reaction, especially dyspnea, bronchospasm, or hypotension. Monitor patients during and for at least 1 hour after the end of the infusion or until signs and symptoms completely resolve. Discontinue use of MYLOTARG in patients who develop signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis, including severe respiratory symptoms or clinically significant hypotension [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  .



    5.3 Hemorrhage



  MYLOTARG is myelosuppressive and can cause fatal or life-threatening hemorrhage due to prolonged thrombocytopenia. In ALFA-0701, (MYLOTARG in combination with chemotherapy), all grades and Grade 3-4 bleeding events were reported in 118/131 (90%) and 27/131 (21%) patients, respectively. Fatal bleeding events (including cerebral hematoma, intracranial hematoma, and subdural hematoma) occurred in 4/131 (3%) patients. Thrombocytopenia with platelet counts less than 50 Gi/L persisting more than 42 days occurred in 19 (19%) patients in the induction phase [see  Adverse Reactions (6)  ]  . The proportion of patients with persistent thrombocytopenia increased with progressive treatment phases and was higher in patients treated with MYLOTARG plus chemotherapy than with chemotherapy alone [see  Adverse Reactions (6)  ]  .



 In AML-19 (MYLOTARG monotherapy at 6 mg/m  2  Day 1 and 3 mg/m  2  Day 8), all grades and Grade 3 or higher bleeding were reported in 28/111 (25%) and 14/111 (13%) patients, respectively. Fatal bleeding occurred in 1/111 (1%). In MyloFrance-1 (MYLOTARG 3 mg/m  2  as monotherapy), Grade 3 bleeding was reported in 4/57 (7%) patients, but no patient experienced Grade 4 hemorrhage.



 Assess blood counts prior to each dose of MYLOTARG and monitor blood counts frequently after treatment with MYLOTARG until resolution of cytopenias. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of bleeding during treatment with MYLOTARG. Manage severe bleeding, hemorrhage or persistent thrombocytopenia using dose delay or permanent discontinuation of MYLOTARG [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  , and provide supportive care per standard practice.



    5.4 QT Interval Prolongation



  QT interval prolongation has been observed in patients treated with other drugs containing calicheamicin. When administering MYLOTARG to patients who have a history of or predisposition for QTc prolongation, who are taking medicinal products that are known to prolong QT interval, and in patients with electrolyte disturbances, obtain electrocardiograms (ECGs) and electrolytes prior to the start of treatment and as needed during administration.



    5.5 Use in AML with Adverse-Risk Cytogenetics



  In subgroup analyses in ALFA-0701, the addition of MYLOTARG to standard combination chemotherapy did not improve event-free survival in the subgroup of patients having adverse-risk cytogenetics (HR 1.11; 95% CI: 0.63, 1.95). For patients being treated with MYLOTARG in combination with daunorubicin and cytarabine for newly-diagnosed de novo AML, when cytogenetics testing results become available consider whether the potential benefit of continuing treatment with MYLOTARG outweighs the risks for the individual patient.



    5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies, MYLOTARG can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal studies, gemtuzumab ozogamicin caused embryo-fetal toxicity, starting at a dose that was approximately 0.4 times the exposure in patients at the maximum recommended dose, based on the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC). Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with MYLOTARG and for at least 6 months after the final dose of MYLOTARG. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with MYLOTARG and for at least 3 months after the last dose of MYLOTARG. Apprise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise women to contact their healthcare provider if they become pregnant or if pregnancy is suspected during treatment with MYLOTARG [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1  ,  8.3)  ,  Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)  ,  and   Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)  ].
