  6.1  Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



   Bleeding  



 In 6010 patients undergoing PCI treated in the REPLACE-2 trial, Angiomax patients exhibited statistically significantly lower rates of bleeding, transfusions, and thrombocytopenia as noted in  Table 2  .

         In 4312 patients undergoing PTCA for treatment of unstable angina in 2 randomized, double-blind studies comparing Angiomax to heparin, Angiomax patients exhibited lower rates of major bleeding and lower requirements for blood transfusions. The incidence of major bleeding is presented in  Table 3  . The incidence of major bleeding was lower in the Angiomax group than in the heparin group.
 

 Table 3: Major Bleeding and Transfusions in BAT Trial (all patients)* 
   *  No monitoring of ACT (or PTT) was done after a target ACT was achieved.  1  Major hemorrhage was defined as the occurrence of any of the following, intracranial bleeding, retroperitoneal bleeding, clinically overt bleeding with a decrease in hemoglobin &gt;=3 g/dL or leading to a transfusion of &gt;=2 units of blood. This table includes data from the entire hospitalization period.

         In the AT-BAT study, of the 51 patients with HIT/HITTS, 1 patient who did not undergo PCI had major bleeding during CABG on the day following angiography. Nine patients had minor bleeding (mostly due to access site bleeding), and 2 patients developed thrombocytopenia.
 

   Other Adverse Reactions  



 Adverse reactions, other than bleeding, observed in clinical trials were similar between the Angiomax treated patients and the control groups.



 Adverse reactions (related adverse events) seen in clinical studies in patients undergoing PCI and PTCA are shown in  Tables 4  and  5  .

         Serious, non-bleeding adverse events were experienced in 2% of 2161 Angiomax-treated patients and 2% of 2151 heparin-treated patients.

These events are listed by body system:  Body as a Whole  : fever, infection, sepsis;  Cardiovascular  : hypotension, syncope, vascular anomaly, ventricular fibrillation;  Nervous  : cerebral ischemia, confusion, facial paralysis;  Respiratory  : lung edema;  Urogenital  : kidney failure, oliguria. In the BAT trial, there was no causality assessment for adverse events.
 

   6.2  Immunogenicity/Re-Exposure

  In  in vitro  studies, Angiomax exhibited no platelet aggregation response against sera from patients with a history of HIT/HITTS.



 Among 494 subjects who received Angiomax in clinical trials and were tested for antibodies, 2 subjects had treatment-emergent positive bivalirudin antibody tests. Neither subject demonstrated clinical evidence of allergic or anaphylactic reactions and repeat testing was not performed. Nine additional patients who had initial positive tests were negative on repeat testing.



   6.3  Postmarketing Experience

  Because postmarketing adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Angiomax: fatal bleeding; hypersensitivity and allergic reactions including reports of anaphylaxis; lack of anticoagulant effect; thrombus formation during PCI with and without intracoronary brachytherapy, including reports of fatal outcomes; pulmonary hemorrhage; cardiac tamponade; and INR increased.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Bleeding events: Hemorrhage can occur at any site. Discontinue Angiomax for an unexplained fall in blood pressure or hematocrit. (  5.1  ) 
 *  Acute Stent Thrombosis: Increased incidence of acute stent thrombosis in STEMI patients undergoing primary PCI. (  2.1  ,  5.2  ) 
 *  Coronary artery brachytherapy: Risk of thrombus formation, including fatal outcomes, in gamma brachytherapy. (  5.3  ) 
 *  Laboratory Test Interference: Bivalirudin interferes with INR measurements. (  5.4  ) 
    
 

   5.1  Bleeding Events



  Although most bleeding associated with the use of Angiomax in PCI/PTCA occurs at the site of arterial puncture, hemorrhage can occur at any site. An unexplained fall in blood pressure or hematocrit should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event and cessation of Angiomax administration [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Angiomax should be used with caution in patients with disease states associated with an increased risk of bleeding.



    5.2  Acute Stent Thrombosis in Patients with STEMI undergoing PCI



   Acute stent thrombosis (AST) (&lt;4 hours) has been observed at a greater frequency in Angiomax treated patients (1.2%, 36/2889) compared to heparin treated patients (0.2%, 6/2911) with STEMI undergoing primary PCI. Among patients who experienced an AST, one fatality (0.03%) occurred in an Angiomax treated patient and one fatality (0.03%) in a heparin treated patient. These patients have been managed by Target Vessel Revascularization (TVR). Patients should remain for at least 24 hours in a facility capable of managing ischemic complications and should be carefully monitored following primary PCI for signs and symptoms consistent with myocardial ischemia.  



    5.3  Coronary Artery Brachytherapy



  An increased risk of thrombus formation, including fatal outcomes, has been associated with the use of Angiomax in gamma brachytherapy.



 If a decision is made to use Angiomax during brachytherapy procedures, maintain meticulous catheter technique, with frequent aspiration and flushing, paying special attention to minimizing conditions of stasis within the catheter or vessels [see Adverse Reactions (  6.3  )].  



    5.4  Laboratory Test Interference



   Angiomax affects International Normalized Ratio (INR), therefore INR measurements made in patients who have been treated with Angiomax may not be useful for determining the appropriate dose of warfarin.
