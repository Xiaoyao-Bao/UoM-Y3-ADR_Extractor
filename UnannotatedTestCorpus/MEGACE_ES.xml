  6.1 Serious and Otherwise Important Adverse Reactions

  The following serious reactions and otherwise important adverse drug reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:



 *  Hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (  4.1  )]  
 *  Pregnancy [see Contraindications (  4.2  )]  
 *  Fetal Effects [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )]  
 *  Thromboembolic Disease [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )]  
 *  Adrenal Insufficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  )]  
      6.2 Clinical Trial Experience
   Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The safety of Megace  (r)  ES (megestrol acetate oral suspension, 125 mg/mL) was based on three studies of megestrol acetate oral suspension (40 mg/mL). The adverse reaction profile of these 3 studies are presented below.



 Adverse events which occurred in at least 5% of patients in any arm of the two clinical efficacy trials and the open trial for megestrol acetate oral suspension are listed below by treatment group. All patients listed had at least one post baseline visit during the 12 study weeks.

   6.3 Postmarketing Experience

  Postmarketing reports associated with megestrol acetate oral suspension include thromboembolic phenomena including thrombophlebitis, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism; and glucose intolerance  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  ,  5.4  )].  
</Section>
    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant  (5.2)  . 
 *  Use with caution in patients with a history of thromboembolic disease  (5.1)  . 
 *  Clinical cases of overt Cushing's Syndrome have been reported in association with the chronic use of megestrol acetate. In addition, clinical cases of adrenal insufficiency have been observed in patients receiving or being withdrawn from chronic megestrol acetate in the stressed and non-stressed state  (5.3)  . 
 *  New onset and exacerbation of pre-existing diabetes have been reported  (5.4)  . 
    
 

   5.1 General



    *  Effects on HIV viral replication have not been determined. 
 *  Use with caution in patients with a history of thromboembolic disease. 
       5.2 Fetal Effects
 

  Megestrol acetate may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. For animal data on fetal effects, see NonClinical Toxicology: Impairment of Fertility (  13.1  ).  There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking (receiving) this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant.



    5.3 Adrenal Insufficiency



  The glucocorticoid activity of megestrol acetate oral suspension has not been fully evaluated. Clinical cases of overt Cushing's Syndrome have been reported in association with the chronic use of megestrol acetate. In addition, clinical cases of adrenal insufficiency have been observed in patients receiving or being withdrawn from chronic megestrol acetate therapy in the stressed and non-stressed state. Furthermore, adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) stimulation testing has revealed the frequent occurrence of asymptomatic pituitary-adrenal suppression in patients treated with chronic megestrol acetate therapy. Therefore, the possibility of adrenal insufficiency should be considered in any patient receiving or being withdrawn from chronic Megace  (r)  ES therapy who presents with symptoms and/or signs suggestive of hypoadrenalism (e.g., hypotension, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, or weakness) in either the stressed or non-stressed state. Laboratory evaluation for adrenal insufficiency and consideration of replacement or stress doses of a rapidly acting glucocorticoid are strongly recommended in such patients. Failure to recognize inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis may result in death. Finally, in patients who are receiving or being withdrawn from chronic Megace  (r)  ES therapy, consideration should be given to the use of empiric therapy with stress doses of a rapidly acting glucocorticoid during stress or serious intercurrent illness (e.g., surgery, infection).



    5.4 Diabetes



  Clinical cases of new onset diabetes mellitus and exacerbation of pre-existing diabetes mellitus have been reported in association with the chronic use of megestrol acetate.
