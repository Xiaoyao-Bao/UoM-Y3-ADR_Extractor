    6.1 Clinical Trials Experience  

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 A total of 591 patients were treated with OPANA in controlled clinical trials.  The clinical trials consisted of patients with acute post-operative pain (n=557) and cancer pain (n=34) trials. 



 The following table lists adverse reactions that were reported in at least 2% of patients receiving OPANA in placebo-controlled trials (acute post-operative pain (N=557)).

         The  common  (&gt;=1% - &lt;10%) adverse drug reactions reported at least once by patients treated with OPANA in the clinical trials organized by MedDRA's (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities) System Organ Class were and not represented in Table 1:
 

   Cardiac disorders:  tachycardia



   Gastrointestinal disorders:    dry mouth, abdominal distention, and flatulence



   General disorders and administration site conditions:  sweating increased



   Nervous system disorders:  anxiety and sedation



   Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders:  hypoxia

     6.2  Post-marketing Experience  

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of opioids. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Nervous system disorder:   amnesia, convulsion, memory impairment



 Serotonin syndrome: Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs.



 Adrenal insufficiency: Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use.



 Anaphylaxis: Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in OPANA



 Immune System Disorders: Angioedema, and other hypersensitivity reactions



 Androgen deficiency: Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with chronic use of opioids  [see Clinical Pharmacology (  12.2  )]  .

      Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse    



   OPANA exposes patients and other users to the risks of opioid addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death.  Assess each patient's risk prior to prescribing OPANA, and monitor all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors and conditions   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )]  .  



     Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS):    



     To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a REMS for these products   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )]  . Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to    



 *  complete a REMS-compliant education program, 
 *  counsel patients and/or their caregivers, with every prescription, on safe use, serious risks, storage, and disposal of these products, 
 *  emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide every time it is provided by their pharmacist, and 
 *  consider other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety. 
        Life-threatening Respiratory Depression    
 

   Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of OPANA.  Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of OPANA or following a dose increase   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  )]  .  



     Accidental Ingestion    



   Accidental ingestion of even one dose of OPANA, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of oxymorphone   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  )]  .  



     Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome    



   Prolonged use of OPANA during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized     and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.4  )]  .  



     Interaction with Alcohol    



   Instruct patients not to consume alcoholic beverages or use prescription or non-prescription products that contain alcohol while taking OPANA. The co-ingestion of alcohol with OPANA may result in increased plasma levels and a potentially fatal overdose of oxymorphone   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.5  )]  .  



     Risks From Concomitant Use With Benzodiazepines Or Other CNS Depressants    



   Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death   [  see   Warnings and Precautions (  5.5  ), Drug Interactions (  7  )]  .  



 *  Reserve concomitant prescribing of OPANA and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. 
 *  Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. 
 *  Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.

    5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse  



  OPANA contains oxymorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, OPANA exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [ see Drug Abuse and Dependence (  9  )  ].



 Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed OPANA. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused.



 Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing OPANA, and monitor all patients receiving OPANA for the development of these behaviors and conditions.  Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as OPANA, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of OPANA along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse.



 Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion.  Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing OPANA. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see Patient Counseling Information (  17  )]  .  Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.



     5.2 Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)  



   To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to do all of the following:  



 *   Complete a REMS-compliant education program offered by an accredited provider of continuing education (CE) or another education program that includes all the elements of the FDA Education Blueprint for Health Care Providers Involved in the Management or Support of Patients with Pain.  
 *   Discuss the safe use, serious risks, and proper storage and disposal of opioid analgesics with patients and/or their caregivers every time these medicines are prescribed. The Patient Counseling Guide (PCG) can be obtained at this link:  www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSPCG  .  
 *   Emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide that they will receive from their pharmacist every time an opioid analgesic is dispensed to them.  
 *   Consider using other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety, such as patient-prescriber agreements that reinforce patient-prescriber responsibilities.  
     To obtain further information on the opioid analgesic REMS and for a list of accredited REMS CME/CE, call 1-800-503-0784, or log on to  www.opioidanalgesicrems.com  . The FDA Blueprint can be found at  www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSBlueprint  .  
 

     5.3 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression  



  Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended.  Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see Overdosage (  10  )]  . Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.



 While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of OPANA, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24-72 hours of initiating therapy with and following dosage increases of OPANA.



 To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of OPANA are essential [ see Dosage and Administration (  2  )  ].  Overestimating the OPANA dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose.



 Accidental ingestion of even one dose of OPANA, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of oxymorphone.



     5.4 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome  



  Prolonged use of OPANA during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly.  Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  ), Patient Counseling Information (  17  )]  . 



     5.5 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants  



  Patients must not consume alcoholic beverages or prescription or non-prescription products containing alcohol while on OPANA therapy. The co-ingestion of alcohol with OPANA may result in increased plasma levels and a potentially fatal overdose of oxymorphone [see Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )].  



 Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of OPANA with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.



 Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone.  Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions (  7  )]  .



 If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use.  In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.



 Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when OPANA is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs).  Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined.  Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [see Drug Interactions (  7  ), Patient Counseling Information (  17  )]  .



     5.6 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients  



  The use of OPANA in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated.



  Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease:  OPANA-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of OPANA [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  )].  



  Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients:  Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions (  8.5  )]  .



 Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating OPANA and when OPANA is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  )]  . Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients.



     5.7 Anaphylaxis, Angioedema, and Other Hypersensitivity Reactions  



  Potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema, have occurred in patients treated with OPANA in the postmarket setting.  The most commonly described clinical features in these reports were swelling of the face, eyes, mouth, lips, tongue, hands, and/or throat; dyspnea; hives, pruritus, and/or rash; and nausea/vomiting.  If anaphylaxis or other hypersensitivity occurs, stop administration of OPANA immediately, discontinue OPANA permanently, and do not rechallenge with any formulation of oxymorphone.  Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if they experience any symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction [see Patient Counseling Information (  17  )]  . 



     5.8 Adrenal Insufficiency  



  Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure.  If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids.  Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers.  Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. 



     5.9 Severe Hypotension  



  OPANA may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients.  There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.5  ) and  Drug Interactions (  7  )].   Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of OPANA. In patients with circulatory shock, OPANA may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of OPANA in patients with circulatory shock.



     5.10 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness  



  In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), OPANA may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with OPANA.



 Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury.  Avoid the use of OPANA in patients with impaired consciousness or coma.



     5.11 Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions  



  OPANA is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus.



 The oxymorphone in OPANA may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi.  Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase.  Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsening symptoms.



     5.12 Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders  



  The oxymorphone in OPANA may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures.  Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during OPANA therapy.



     5.13 Withdrawal  



  Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g, pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including OPANA.  In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms [see Drug Interactions (  7  )]  .



 When discontinuing OPANA in a physically-dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (  2.8  )]  . Do not abruptly discontinue OPANA in these patients [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (  9.3  )]  .



     5.14 Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery  



  OPANA may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery.  Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of OPANA and know how they will react to the medication.



     5.15 Hepatic Impairment  



  A study of extended-release oxymorphone tablets in patients with hepatic disease indicated greater plasma concentrations than in those with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )]  . Use OPANA with caution in patients with mild impairment, starting with the lowest dose and titrating slowly while carefully monitoring for side effects [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  ,  2.3  )]  . OPANA is contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.
