          Adverse reactions which were reported in 1% to 3% of the patients were: abdominal pain, acid regurgitation, constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, nausea, irritability, mental acuity decreased, nervousness, upper respiratory infection, and pharyngitis.
 

 The following list of adverse reactions is based on the experience in 473 patients treated with FLEXERIL 10 mg in additional controlled clinical studies, 7607 patients in the postmarketing surveillance program, and reports received since the drug was marketed. The overall incidence of adverse reactions among patients in the surveillance program was less than the incidence in the controlled clinical studies.



 The adverse reactions reported most frequently with FLEXERIL were drowsiness, dry mouth and dizziness. The incidence of these common adverse reactions was lower in the surveillance program than in the controlled clinical studies:

         Among the less frequent adverse reactions, there was no appreciable difference in incidence in controlled clinical studies or in the surveillance program. Adverse reactions which were reported in 1% to 3% of the patients were: fatigue/tiredness, asthenia, nausea, constipation, dyspepsia, unpleasant taste, blurred vision, headache, nervousness, and confusion.

   General



  Because of its atropine-like action, FLEXERIL should be used with caution in patients with a history of urinary retention, angle-closure glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and in patients taking anticholinergic medication.



    Impaired Hepatic Function



  The plasma concentration of cyclobenzaprine is increased in patients with hepatic impairment (see  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics,    Hepatic Impairment  ). These patients are generally more susceptible to drugs with potentially sedating effects, including cyclobenzaprine. FLEXERIL should be used with caution in subjects with mild hepatic impairment starting with a 5 mg dose and titrating slowly upward. Due to the lack of data in subjects with more severe hepatic insufficiency, the use of FLEXERIL in subjects with moderate to severe impairment is not recommended.



    Information for Patients



  FLEXERIL, especially when used with alcohol or other CNS depressants, may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. In the elderly, the frequency and severity of adverse events associated with the use of cyclobenzaprine, with or without concomitant medications, is increased. In elderly patients, FLEXERIL should be initiated with a 5 mg dose and titrated slowly upward.



    Drug Interactions



  FLEXERIL may have life-threatening interactions with MAO inhibitors. (See  CONTRAINDICATIONS.  )



 FLEXERIL may enhance the effects of alcohol, barbiturates, and other CNS depressants.



 Tricyclic antidepressants may block the antihypertensive action of guanethidine and similarly acting compounds.

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings">    WARNINGS



  Cyclobenzaprine is closely related to the tricyclic antidepressants, e.g., amitriptyline and imipramine. In short term studies for indications other than muscle spasm associated with acute musculoskeletal conditions, and usually at doses somewhat greater than those recommended for skeletal muscle spasm, some of the more serious central nervous system reactions noted with the tricyclic antidepressants have occurred (see  WARNINGS  , below, and  ADVERSE REACTIONS  ).



 Tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to produce arrhythmias, sinus tachycardia, prolongation of the conduction time leading to myocardial infarction and stroke.



 FLEXERIL may enhance the effects of alcohol, barbiturates, and other CNS depressants.
