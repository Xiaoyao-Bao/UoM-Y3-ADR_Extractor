  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 The safety of OCREVUS has been evaluated in 1311 patients across MS clinical studies, which included 825 patients in active-controlled clinical trials in patients with relapsing forms of MS (RMS) and 486 patients in a placebo-controlled study in patients with primary progressive MS (PPMS).



     Adverse Reactions in Patients with Relapsing Forms of MS  



 In active-controlled clinical trials (Study 1 and Study 2), 825 patients with RMS received OCREVUS 600 mg intravenously every 24 weeks (initial treatment was given as two separate 300 mg infusions at Weeks 0 and 2)  [see  Clinical Studies (14.1)  ].  The overall exposure in the 96-week controlled treatment periods was 1448 patient-years.



 The most common adverse reactions in RMS trials (incidence &gt;= 10%) were upper respiratory tract infections and infusion reactions.  Table 2  summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred in RMS trials (Study 1 and Study 2).

             Adverse Reactions in Patients with Primary Progressive MS  
 

 In a placebo-controlled clinical trial (Study 3), a total of 486 patients with PPMS received one course of OCREVUS (600 mg of OCREVUS administered as two 300 mg infusions two weeks apart) given intravenously every 24 weeks and 239 patients received placebo intravenously  [see  Clinical Studies (14.2)  ].  The overall exposure in the controlled treatment period was 1416 patient-years, with median treatment duration of 3 years.



 The most common adverse reactions in the PPMS trial (incidence &gt;= 10%) were upper respiratory tract infections, infusion reactions, skin infections, and lower respiratory tract infections.  Table 3  summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred in the PPMS trial (Study 3).

             Laboratory Abnormalities  
 

     Decreased Immunoglobulins  



 OCREVUS decreased total immunoglobulins with the greatest decline seen in IgM levels. In MS clinical trials, there was no apparent association between immunoglobulin decrease and risk for serious infections.



 In the active-controlled (RMS) trials (Study 1 and Study 2), the proportion of patients at baseline reporting IgG, IgA, and IgM below the lower limit of normal (LLN) in OCREVUS-treated patients was 0.5%, 1.5%, and 0.1%, respectively. Following treatment, the proportion of OCREVUS-treated patients reporting IgG, IgA, and IgM below the LLN at 96 weeks was 1.5%, 2.4%, and 16.5%, respectively.



 In the placebo-controlled (PPMS) trial (Study 3), the proportion of patients at baseline reporting IgG, IgA, and IgM below the LLN in OCREVUS-treated patients was 0.0%, 0.2%, and 0.2%, respectively. Following treatment, the proportion of OCREVUS-treated patients reporting IgG, IgA, and IgM below the LLN at 120 weeks was 1.1%, 0.5%, and 15.5%, respectively.



     Decreased Neutrophil Levels  



 In the PPMS clinical trial (Study 3), decreased neutrophil counts occurred in 13% of OCREVUS-treated patients compared to 10% in placebo patients. The majority of the decreased neutrophil counts were only observed once for a given patient treated with OCREVUS and were between LLN - 1.5 * 10  9  /L and 1.0 * 10  9  /L. Overall, 1% of the patients in the OCREVUS group had neutrophil counts less than 1.0 * 10  9  /L and these were not associated with an infection.



   6.2 Immunogenicity

  As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. Immunogenicity data are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the test methods used. Additionally, the observed incidence of a positive result in a test method may be influenced by several factors, including sample handling, timing of sample collection, drug interference, concomitant medication, and the underlying disease. Therefore, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to OCREVUS with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.



 Patients in MS trials (Study 1, Study 2, and Study 3) were tested at multiple time points (baseline and every 6 months post-treatment for the duration of the trial) for anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). Out of 1311 patients treated with OCREVUS, 12 (~1%) tested positive for ADAs, of which 2 patients tested positive for neutralizing antibodies. These data are not adequate to assess the impact of ADAs on the safety and efficacy of OCREVUS.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Infusion reactions: Management recommendations for infusion reactions depend on the type and severity of the reaction. Permanently discontinue OCREVUS if a life-threatening or disabling infusion reaction occurs (  2.3  ,  5.1  ) 
 *  Infections: Delay OCREVUS administration in patients with an active infection until the infection is resolved. Vaccination with live-attenuated or live vaccines is not recommended during treatment with OCREVUS and after discontinuation, until B-cell repletion (  5.2  ) 
 *  Malignancies: An increased risk of malignancy, including breast cancer, may exist with OCREVUS (  5.3  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Infusion Reactions



  OCREVUS can cause infusion reactions, which can include pruritus, rash, urticaria, erythema, bronchospasm, throat irritation, oropharyngeal pain, dyspnea, pharyngeal or laryngeal edema, flushing, hypotension, pyrexia, fatigue, headache, dizziness, nausea, and tachycardia. In multiple sclerosis (MS) clinical trials, the incidence of infusion reactions in OCREVUS-treated patients [who received methylprednisolone (or an equivalent steroid) and possibly other pre-medication to reduce the risk of infusion reactions prior to each infusion] was 34 to 40%, with the highest incidence with the first infusion. There were no fatal infusion reactions, but 0.3% of OCREVUS-treated MS patients experienced infusion reactions that were serious, some requiring hospitalization.



 Observe patients treated with OCREVUS for infusion reactions during the infusion and for at least one hour after completion of the infusion. Inform patients that infusion reactions can occur up to 24 hours after the infusion.



    Reducing the Risk of Infusion Reactions and Managing Infusion Reactions  



 Administer pre-medication (e.g., methylprednisolone or an equivalent corticosteroid, and an antihistamine) to reduce the frequency and severity of infusion reactions. The addition of an antipyretic (e.g., acetaminophen) may also be considered [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ].  



 Management recommendations for infusion reactions depend on the type and severity of the reaction [see  Dosage and Administration (2.5)  ].  For life-threatening infusion reactions, immediately and permanently stop OCREVUS and administer appropriate supportive treatment. For less severe infusion reactions, management may involve temporarily stopping the infusion, reducing the infusion rate, and/or administering symptomatic treatment.



    5.2 Infections



  A higher proportion of OCREVUS-treated patients experienced infections compared to patients taking REBIF or placebo. In RMS trials, 58% of OCREVUS-treated patients experienced one or more infections compared to 52% of REBIF-treated patients. In the PPMS trial, 70% of OCREVUS-treated patients experienced one or more infections compared to 68% of patients on placebo. OCREVUS increased the risk for upper respiratory tract infections, lower respiratory tract infections, skin infections, and herpes-related infections [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  OCREVUS was not associated with an increased risk of serious infections in MS patients. Delay OCREVUS administration in patients with an active infection until the infection is resolved.



    Respiratory Tract Infections  



 A higher proportion of OCREVUS-treated patients experienced respiratory tract infections compared to patients taking REBIF or placebo. In RMS trials, 40% of OCREVUS-treated patients experienced upper respiratory tract infections compared to 33% of REBIF-treated patients, and 8% of OCREVUS-treated patients experienced lower respiratory tract infections compared to 5% of REBIF-treated patients. In the PPMS trial, 49% of OCREVUS-treated patients experienced upper respiratory tract infections compared to 43% of patients on placebo and 10% of OCREVUS-treated patients experienced lower respiratory tract infections compared to 9% of patients on placebo. The infections were predominantly mild to moderate and consisted mostly of upper respiratory tract infections and bronchitis.



    Herpes  



 In active-controlled (RMS) clinical trials, herpes infections were reported more frequently in OCREVUS-treated patients than in REBIF-treated patients, including herpes zoster (2.1% vs. 1.0%), herpes simplex (0.7% vs. 0.1%), oral herpes (3.0% vs. 2.2%), genital herpes (0.1% vs. 0%), and herpes virus infection (0.1% vs. 0%). Infections were predominantly mild to moderate in severity. There were no reports of disseminated herpes.



 In the placebo-controlled (PPMS) clinical trial, oral herpes was reported more frequently in the OCREVUS-treated patients than in the patients on placebo (2.7% vs 0.8%).



    Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)  



 PML is an opportunistic viral infection of the brain caused by the John Cunningham (JC) virus that typically only occurs in patients who are immunocompromised, and that usually leads to death or severe disability. Although no cases of PML were identified in OCREVUS clinical trials, JC virus infection resulting in PML has been observed in patients treated with other anti-CD20 antibodies and other MS therapies and has been associated with some risk factors (e.g., immunocompromised patients, polytherapy with immunosuppressants). At the first sign or symptom suggestive of PML, withhold OCREVUS and perform an appropriate diagnostic evaluation. MRI findings may be apparent before clinical signs or symptoms. Typical symptoms associated with PML are diverse, progress over days to weeks, and include progressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes.



    Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Reactivation  



 There were no reports of hepatitis B reactivation in MS patients treated with OCREVUS. Fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death caused by HBV reactivation have occurred in patients treated with other anti-CD20 antibodies. Perform HBV screening in all patients before initiation of treatment with OCREVUS. Do not administer OCREVUS to patients with active HBV confirmed by positive results for HBsAg and anti-HB tests. For patients who are negative for surface antigen [HBsAg] and positive for HB core antibody [HBcAb+] or are carriers of HBV [HBsAg+], consult liver disease experts before starting and during treatment.



    Possible Increased Risk of Immunosuppressant Effects with Other Immunosuppressants  



 When initiating OCREVUS after an immunosuppressive therapy or initiating an immunosuppressive therapy after OCREVUS, consider the potential for increased immunosuppressive effects [see  Drug Interactions (7.1)  and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.1  ,  12.2)  ].  OCREVUS has not been studied in combination with other MS therapies.



    Vaccinations  



  Administer all immunizations according to immunization guidelines at least 4 weeks prior to initiation of OCREVUS for live or live-attenuated vaccines and, whenever possible, at least 2 weeks prior to initiation of OCREVUS for non-live vaccines.  



  OCREVUS may interfere with the effectiveness of non-live vaccines [see  Drug Interactions (7.2)  ].    



  The safety of immunization with live or live-attenuated vaccines following OCREVUS therapy has not been studied, and vaccination with live-attenuated or live vaccines is not recommended during treatment and until B-cell repletion [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)  ]  .  



     Vaccination of Infants Born to Mothers Treated with OCREVUS During Pregnancy    



  In infants of mothers exposed to OCREVUS during pregnancy, do not administer live or live-attenuated vaccines before confirming the recovery of B-cell counts as measured by CD19  +  B-cells. Depletion of B-cells in these infants may increase the risks from live or live-attenuated vaccines.  



  You may administer non-live vaccines, as indicated, prior to recovery from B-cell depletion, but should consider assessing vaccine immune responses, including consultation with a qualified specialist, to assess whether a protective immune response was mounted [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ].    



    5.3 Malignancies



  An increased risk of malignancy with OCREVUS may exist. In controlled trials, malignancies, including breast cancer, occurred more frequently in OCREVUS-treated patients. Breast cancer occurred in 6 of 781 females treated with OCREVUS and none of 668 females treated with REBIF or placebo. Patients should follow standard breast cancer screening guidelines.
