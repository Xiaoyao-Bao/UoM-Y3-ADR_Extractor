  The following adverse reactions have been identified during use of  BLEPHAMIDE    (r)  ophthalmic suspension. Because reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 Adverse reactions have occurred with corticosteroid/antibacterial combination drugs which can be attributed to the corticosteroid component, the antibacterial component, or the combination.



 Reactions occurring with  BLEPHAMIDE    (r)  ophthalmic suspension include: cataract, dizziness, eye discharge, eyelid edema, eyelid erythema, eye irritation, eye pain, eye pruritus, and hypersensitivity including rash, skin pruritus, urticaria, ocular hyperemia, and visual disturbance (blurry vision).



 Reactions occurring most often from the presence of the antibacterial ingredient are allergic sensitizations. Fatalities have occurred, although rarely, due to severe reactions to sulfonamides including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, fulminant hepatic necrosis, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and other blood dyscrasias (see  WARNINGS  ).



 The reactions due to the corticosteroid component in decreasing order of frequency are: delayed wound healing, elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) with possible development of glaucoma and infrequent optic nerve damage, and posterior subcapsular cataract formation.



 Although systemic effects are extremely uncommon, there have been rare occurrences of systemic hypercorticoidism after use of topical corticosteroids.



 Corticosteroid-containing preparations can also cause acute anterior uveitis or perforation of the globe. Mydriasis, loss of accommodation and ptosis have occasionally been reported following local use of corticosteroids.



     Secondary Infection  



 The development of secondary infection has occurred after use of combinations containing corticosteroids and antibacterials. Fungal and viral infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term applications of corticosteroid. The possibility of fungal invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where corticosteroid treatment has been used.



 Secondary bacterial ocular infection following suppression of host responses also occurs.

   General



  The initial prescription and renewal of the medication order beyond 20 milliliters of the suspension should be made by a physician only after examination of the patient with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. If signs and symptoms fail to improve after two days, the patient should be re-evaluated.



 The possibility of fungal infections of the cornea should be considered after prolonged corticosteroid dosing. Fungal cultures should be taken when appropriate.



 Use with caution in patients with severe dry eye.



 The p-aminobenzoic acid present in purulent exudates competes with sulfonamides and can reduce their effectiveness.



    Information for Patients



  If inflammation or pain persists longer than 48 hours or becomes aggravated, the patient should be advised to discontinue use of the medication and consult a physician (see  WARNINGS  ).



 Contact lenses should not be worn during the use of this product.



 This product is sterile when packaged. To prevent contamination, care should be taken to avoid touching the applicator tip to eyelids or to any other surface. The use of this bottle by more than one person may spread infection. Keep bottle tightly closed when not in use. Protect from light. Sulfonamide solutions darken on prolonged standing and exposure to heat and light. Do not use if solution has darkened. Yellowing does not affect activity. Keep out of the reach of children.



    Laboratory Tests



  Eyelid cultures and tests to determine the susceptibility of organisms to sulfacetamide may be indicated if signs and symptoms persist or recur in spite of the recommended course of treatment with BLEPHAMIDE    (r)  ophthalmic suspension.



    Drug Interactions



   BLEPHAMIDE    (r)  ophthalmic suspension is incompatible with silver preparations. Local anesthetics related to p-aminobenzoic acid may antagonize the action of the sulfonamides.



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility



  Prednisolone has been reported to be noncarcinogenic. Long-term animal studies for carcinogenic potential have not been performed with sulfacetamide.



 One author detected chromosomal nondisjunction in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae  following application of sulfacetamide sodium. The significance of this finding to topical ophthalmic use of sulfacetamide sodium in the human is unknown.



 Mutagenic studies with prednisolone have been negative. Studies on reproduction and fertility have not been performed with sulfacetamide. A long-term chronic toxicity study in dogs showed that high oral doses of prednisolone prevented estrus. A decrease in fertility was seen in male and female rats that were mated following oral dosing with another glucocorticosteroid.



    Pregnancy



   Teratogenic Effects  



 Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with sulfacetamide sodium. Prednisolone has been shown to be teratogenic in rabbits, hamsters, and mice. In mice, prednisolone has been shown to be teratogenic when given in doses 1 to 10 times the human ocular dose. Dexamethasone, hydrocortisone and prednisolone were ocularly applied to both eyes of pregnant mice five times per day on days 10 through 13 of gestation. A significant increase in the incidence of cleft palate was observed in the fetuses of the treated mice. There are no adequate well-controlled studies in pregnant women dosed with corticosteroids.



 Kernicterus may be precipitated in infants by sulfonamides being given systemically during the third trimester of pregnancy. It is not known whether sulfacetamide sodium can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or whether it can affect reproductive capacity.



  BLEPHAMIDE    (r)  ophthalmic suspension should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.



    Nursing Mothers



  It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. Systemically administered sulfonamides are capable of producing kernicterus in infants of lactating women. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from sulfacetamide sodium and prednisolone acetate ophthalmic suspensions, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the medication.



    Pediatric Use



  Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 6 years have not been established.

  NOT FOR INJECTION INTO THE EYE.



 Prolonged use of corticosteroids may result in posterior subcapsular cataract formation and may increase intraocular pressure in susceptible individuals, resulting in ocular hypertension/glaucoma with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision.



 If the product is used for 10 days or longer, intraocular pressure should be routinely monitored even though it may be difficult in children and uncooperative patients. Corticosteroids should be used with caution in the presence of glaucoma. Intraocular pressure should be checked frequently.



 The use of steroids after cataract surgery may delay healing and increase the incidence of bleb formation.



 In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforation has been known to occur with the use of topical corticosteroids.



 In acute purulent conditions of the eye, corticosteroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection.



 The use of ocular corticosteroids may prolong the course and may exacerbate the severity of many viral infections of the eye (including herpes simplex). Employment of corticosteroid medication in the treatment of herpes simplex requires great caution.



 Prolonged use of BLEPHAMIDE    (r)  ophthalmic suspension may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections.



 Prolonged use of topical anti-bacterial agents may give rise to overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms including fungi.



 A significant percentage of staphylococcal isolates are completely resistant to sulfonamides.



 Acute anterior uveitis may occur in susceptible individuals, primarily Blacks.



 Fatalities have occurred, although rarely, due to severe reactions to sulfonamides including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, fulminant hepatic necrosis, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia and other blood dyscrasias. Sensitization may recur when a sulfonamide is readministered, irrespective of the route of administration.



 If signs of hypersensitivity, skin rash, or other serious reactions occur, discontinue use of this preparation. Cross-sensitivity among corticosteroids has been demonstrated (see  ADVERSE REACTIONS  ).
