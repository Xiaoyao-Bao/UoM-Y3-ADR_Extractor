      Multiple Sclerosis    

  Mitoxantrone has been administered to 149 patients with multiple sclerosis in two randomized clinical trials, including 21 patients who received mitoxantrone in combination with corticosteroids.



 In Study 1, the proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to an adverse event was 9.7% (n=6) in the 12 mg/m  2  mitoxantrone arm (leukopenia, depression, decreased LV function, bone pain and emesis, renal failure, and one discontinuation to prevent future complications from repeated urinary tract infections) compared to 3.1% (n=2) in the placebo arm (hepatitis and myocardial infarction).  The following clinical adverse experiences were significantly more frequent in the mitoxantrone groups: nausea, alopecia, urinary tract infection, and menstrual disorders, including amenorrhea.



 Table 4a summarizes clinical adverse events of all intensities occurring in &gt;= 5% of patients in either dose group of mitoxantrone and that were numerically greater on drug than on placebo in Study 1.  The majority of these events were of mild to moderate intensity, and nausea was the only adverse event that occurred with severe intensity in more than one patient (three patients [5%] in the 12 mg/m  2  group).  Of note, alopecia consisted of mild hair thinning.



 Two of the 127 patients treated with mitoxantrone in Study 1 had decreased LVEF to below 50% at some point during the 2 years of treatment.  An additional patient receiving 12 mg/m  2  did not have LVEF measured, but had another echocardiographic measure of ventricular function (fractional shortening) that led to discontinuation from the study.

 The proportion of patients experiencing any infection during Study 1 was 67% for the placebo group, 85% for the 5 mg/m  2  group, and 81% for the 12 mg/m  2  group.  However, few of these infections required hospitalization: one placebo patient (tonsillitis), three 5 mg/m  2  patients (enteritis, urinary tract infection, viral infection), and four 12 mg/m  2  patients (tonsillitis, urinary tract infection [two], endometritis).



 Table 4b summarizes laboratory abnormalities that occurred in &gt;= 5% of patients in either mitoxantrone dose group, and that were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group.

 There was no difference among treatment groups in the incidence or severity of hemorrhagic events.



 In Study 2, mitoxantrone was administered once a month.  Clinical adverse events most frequently reported in the mitoxantrone group included amenorrhea (53% of female patients), alopecia (33% of patients), nausea (29% of patients), and asthenia (24% of patients).  Tables 5a and 5b respectively summarize adverse events and laboratory abnormalities occurring in &gt;5% of patients in the mitoxantrone group and numerically more frequent than in the control group.

 Leukopenia and neutropenia were reported in the M+MP group (see Table 5b).  Neutropenia occurred within 3 weeks after mitoxantrone administration and was always reversible.  Only mild to moderate intensity infections were reported in 9 of 21 patients in the M+MP group and in 3 of 21 patients in the MP group; none of these required hospitalization.  There was no difference among treatment groups in the incidence or severity of hemorrhagic events.  There were no withdrawals from Study 2 for safety reasons.    



       Leukemia    

  Mitoxantrone has been studied in approximately 600 patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL).  Table 6 represents the adverse reaction experience in the large U.S. comparative study of mitoxantrone + cytarabine vs. daunorubicin + cytarabine.  Experience in the large international study was similar.  A much wider experience in a variety of other tumor types revealed no additional important reactions other than cardiomyopathy (see  WARNINGS  ).  It should be appreciated that the listed adverse reaction categories include overlapping clinical symptoms related to the same condition, e.g., dyspnea, cough and pneumonia.  In addition, the listed adverse reactions cannot all necessarily be attributed to chemotherapy as it is often impossible to distinguish effects of the drug and effects of the underlying disease.  It is clear, however, that the combination of mitoxantrone + cytarabine was responsible for nausea and vomiting, alopecia, mucositis/stomatitis, and myelosuppression.



 Table 6 summarizes adverse reactions occurring in patients treated with mitoxantrone + cytarabine in comparison with those who received daunorubicin + cytarabine for therapy of ANLL in a large multicenter randomized prospective U.S. trial. 



             Adverse reactions are presented as major categories and selected examples of clinically significant subcategories.

       General    

      Allergic Reaction    



 Hypotension, urticaria, dyspnea, and rashes have been reported occasionally.  Anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions have been reported rarely.



     Cutaneous    



 Extravasation at the infusion site has been reported, which may result in erythema, swelling, pain, burning, and/or blue discoloration of the skin.  Extravasation can result in tissue necrosis with resultant need for debridement and skin grafting.  Phlebitis has also been reported at the site of the infusion.



     Hematologic    



 Topoisomerase II inhibitors, including mitoxantrone, in combination with other antineoplastic agents or alone, have been associated with the development of acute leukemia (see    WARNINGS    ).



     Leukemia    



 Myelosuppression is rapid in onset and is consistent with the requirement to produce significant marrow hypoplasia in order to achieve a response in acute leukemia.  The incidences of infection and bleeding seen in the U.S. trial are consistent with those reported for other standard induction regimens.



     Hormone-Refractory Prostate Cancer    



 In a randomized study where dose escalation was required for neutrophil counts greater than 1000/mm  3  , Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC &lt; 500 /mm  3  ) was observed in 54% of patients treated with mitoxantrone + low-dose prednisone.  In a separate randomized trial where patients were treated with 14 mg/m  2  , Grade 4 neutropenia in 23% of patients treated with mitoxantrone + hydrocortisone was observed.  Neutropenic fever/infection occurred in 11% and 10% of patients receiving mitoxantrone + corticosteroids, respectively, on the two trials.  Platelets &lt; 50,000/mm  3  were noted in 4% and 3% of patients receiving mitoxantrone + corticosteroids on these trials, and there was one patient death on mitoxantrone + hydrocortisone due to intracranial hemorrhage after a fall.



     Gastrointestinal    



 Nausea and vomiting occurred acutely in most patients and may have contributed to reports of dehydration, but were generally mild to moderate and could be controlled through the use of antiemetics.  Stomatitis/mucositis occurred within 1 week of therapy.



     Cardiovascular    



 Congestive heart failure, tachycardia, EKG changes including arrhythmias, chest pain, and asymptomatic decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction have occurred (see    WARNINGS    ).



     Pulmonary    



 Interstitial pneumonitis has been reported in cancer patients receiving combination chemotherapy that included mitoxantrone.

    BOXED WARNING: 

      WARNING     Mitoxantrone Injection, USP (concentrate) should be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy agents. Mitoxantrone Injection, USP (concentrate) should be given slowly into a freely flowing intravenous infusion. It must   never   be given subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or intra-arterially. Severe local tissue damage may occur if there is extravasation during administration (see       ADVERSE REACTIONS, General,  Cutaneous       and       DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Preparation and Administration Precautions      ). NOT FOR INTRATHECAL USE. Severe injury with permanent sequelae can result from intrathecal administration (see       WARNINGS, General      ). Except for the treatment of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, mitoxantrone therapy generally should not be given to patients with baseline neutrophil counts of less than 1,500 cells/mm  3  . In order to monitor the occurrence of bone marrow suppression, primarily neutropenia, which may be severe and result in infection, it is recommended that frequent peripheral blood cell counts be performed on all patients receiving mitoxantrone. Cardiotoxicity: Congestive heart failure (CHF), potentially fatal, may occur either during therapy with mitoxantrone or months to years after termination of therapy. Cardiotoxicity risk increases with cumulative mitoxantrone dose and may occur whether or not cardiac risk factors are present. Presence or history of cardiovascular disease, radiotherapy to the mediastinal/pericardial area, previous therapy with other anthracyclines or anthracenediones, or use of other cardiotoxic drugs may increase this risk. In cancer patients, the risk of symptomatic CHF was estimated to be 2.6% for patients receiving up to a cumulative dose of 140 mg/m  2  . To mitigate the cardiotoxicity risk with mitoxantrone, prescribers should consider the following: All Patients: 



 *  All patients should be assessed for cardiac signs and symptoms by history, physical examination, and ECG prior to start of mitoxantrone therapy. 
 *  All patients should have baseline quantitative evaluation of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) using appropriate methodology (ex. Echocardiogram, multi-gated radionuclide angiography (MUGA), MRI, etc.). 
    Multiple Sclerosis Patients: 
 

 *  MS patients with a baseline LVEF below the lower limit of normal should not be treated with mitoxantrone.  
 *  MS patients should be assessed for cardiac signs and symptoms by history, physical examination and ECG prior to each dose.  
 *  MS patients should undergo quantitative re-evaluation of LVEF prior to each dose using the same methodology that was used to assess baseline LVEF. Additional doses of mitoxantrone should not be administered to multiple sclerosis patients who have experienced either a drop in LVEF to below the lower limit of normal or a clinically significant reduction in LVEF during mitoxantrone therapy. 
 *  MS patients should not receive a cumulative mitoxantrone dose greater than 140 mg/m2. 
 *  MS patients should undergo yearly quantitative LVEF evaluation after stopping mitoxantrone to monitor for late occurring cardiotoxicity. 
    Secondary Leukemia: Mitoxantrone therapy in patients with MS and in patients with cancer increases the risk of developing secondary acute myeloid leukemia. For additional information, see       WARNINGS       and       DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION      . 
</Section>
    <Section id="S3" name="precautions">     PRECAUTIONS:  



     General    



  Therapy with mitoxantrone should be accompanied by close and frequent monitoring of hematologic and chemical laboratory parameters, as well as frequent patient observation.



 Systemic infections should be treated concomitantly with or just prior to commencing therapy with mitoxantrone.



      Information for Patients    



  See FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).



 Inform patients of the availability of a Medication Guide and instruct them to read the Medication Guide prior to initiating treatment with mitoxantrone and prior to each infusion.  Review the Mitoxantrone Medication Guide with every patient prior to initiation of treatment and periodically during treatment.  Instruct patients that mitoxantrone should be taken only as prescribed.



 Advise patients that mitoxantrone can cause myelosuppression and inform patients of the signs and symptoms of myelosuppression.  Advise patients that mitoxantrone can cause congestive heart failure that may lead to death even in people who have never had heart problems before, and inform patients of the signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure.  Advise patients receiving mitoxantrone to treat multiple sclerosis that they should receive cardiac monitoring prior to each mitoxantrone dose and yearly after stopping mitoxantrone.



 Mitoxantrone may impart a blue-green color to the urine for 24 hours after administration, and patients should be advised to expect this during therapy.  Bluish discoloration of the sclera may also occur. 



      Laboratory Tests    



  A complete blood count, including platelets, should be obtained prior to each course of mitoxantrone and in the event that signs and symptoms of infection develop.  Liver function tests should also be performed prior to each course of therapy.  Mitoxantrone therapy in multiple sclerosis patients with abnormal liver function tests is not recommended because mitoxantrone clearance is reduced by hepatic impairment and no laboratory measurement can predict drug clearance and dose adjustments.



 In leukemia treatment, hyperuricemia may occur as a result of rapid lysis of tumor cells by mitoxantrone.  Serum uric acid levels should be monitored and hypouricemic therapy instituted prior to the initiation of antileukemic therapy.



 Women with multiple sclerosis who are biologically capable of becoming pregnant, even if they are using birth control, should have a pregnancy test, and the results should be known, before receiving each dose of mitoxantrone (see   WARNINGS   ,     Pregnancy      ).



      Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility    



    Carcinogenesis    



 Intravenous treatment of rats and mice, once every 21 days for 24 months, with mitoxantrone resulted in an increased incidence of fibroma and external auditory canal tumors in rats at a dose of 0.03 mg/kg (0.02 fold the recommended human dose, on a mg/m  2  basis), and hepatocellular adenoma in male mice at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg (0.03 fold the recommended human dose, on a mg/m  2  basis).  Intravenous treatment of rats, once every 21 days for 12 months with mitoxantrone resulted in an increased incidence of external auditory canal tumors in rats at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg (0.15 fold the recommended human dose, on a mg/m  2  basis).



   Mutagenesis    



 Mitoxantrone was clastogenic in the  in vivo    rat bone marrow assay.  Mitoxantrone was also clastogenic in two  in vitro    assays; it induced DNA damage in primary rat hepatocytes and sister chromatid exchanges in Chinese hamster ovary cells.  Mitoxantrone was mutagenic in bacterial and mammalian test systems (Ames/Salmonella and  E. coli    and L5178Y TK+/-mouse lymphoma).



      Drug Interactions    



  Mitoxantrone and its metabolites are excreted in bile and urine, but it is not known whether the metabolic or excretory pathways are saturable, may be inhibited or induced, or if mitoxantrone and its metabolites undergo enterohepatic circulation.  To date, post-marketing experience has not revealed any significant drug interactions in patients who have received mitoxantrone for treatment of cancer.  Information on drug interactions in patients with multiple sclerosis is limited.



 Following concurrent administration of mitoxantrone with corticosteroids, no evidence of drug interactions has been observed.



      Special Populations    



    Hepatic Impairment    



 Patients with multiple sclerosis who have hepatic impairment should ordinarily not be treated with mitoxantrone.  Mitoxantrone should be administered with caution to other patients with hepatic impairment.  In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the AUC is more than three times greater than the value observed in patients with normal hepatic function.



      Pregnancy    



    Pregnancy Category D    



 (see   WARNINGS    ).



      Nursing Mothers    



  Mitoxantrone is excreted in human milk and significant concentrations (18 ng/mL) have been reported for 28 days after the last administration.  Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in infants from mitoxantrone, breastfeeding should be discontinued before starting treatment.



      Pediatric Use    



  Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.



      Geriatric Use    



    Multiple Sclerosis    



 Clinical studies of mitoxantrone did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients.  Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. 



   Hormone-Refractory Prostate Cancer    



 One hundred forty-six patients aged 65 and over and 52 younger patients (&lt;65 years) have been treated with mitoxantrone in controlled clinical studies.  These studies did not include sufficient numbers of younger patients to determine whether they respond differently from older patients.  However, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.



   Acute Nonlymphocytic Leukemia    



 Although definitive studies with mitoxantrone have not been performed in geriatric patients with ANLL, toxicity may be more frequent in the elderly.  Elderly patients are more likely to have age-related comorbidities due to disease or disease therapy.
</Section>
    <Section id="S4" name="warnings">     WARNINGS:  



  WHEN MITOXANTRONE IS USED IN HIGH DOSES (&gt; 14 mg/m  2  /d x 3 days) SUCH AS INDICATED FOR THE TREATMENT OF LEUKEMIA, SEVERE MYELOSUPPRESSION WILL OCCUR.  THEREFORE, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT MITOXANTRONE BE ADMINISTERED ONLY BY PHYSICIANS EXPERIENCED IN THE CHEMOTHERAPY OF THIS DISEASE.  LABORATORY AND SUPPORTIVE SERVICES MUST BE AVAILABLE FOR HEMATOLOGIC AND CHEMISTRY MONITORING AND ADJUNCTIVE THERAPIES, INCLUDING ANTIBIOTICS.  BLOOD AND BLOOD PRODUCTS MUST BE AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT PATIENTS DURING THE EXPECTED PERIOD OF MEDULLARY HYPOPLASIA AND SEVERE MYELOSUPPRESSION.  PARTICULAR CARE SHOULD BE GIVEN TO ASSURING FULL HEMATOLOGIC RECOVERY BEFORE UNDERTAKING CONSOLIDATION THERAPY (IF THIS TREATMENT IS USED) AND PATIENTS SHOULD BE MONITORED CLOSELY DURING THIS PHASE.  MITOXANTRONE ADMINISTERED AT ANY DOSE CAN CAUSE MYELOSUPPRESSION.



      General    



  Patients with pre-existing myelosuppression as the result of prior drug therapy should not receive mitoxantrone unless it is felt that the possible benefit from such treatment warrants the risk of further medullary suppression.



 The safety of Mitoxantrone Injection, USP (concentrate) in patients with hepatic insufficiency is not established (see   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY    ).



 Safety for use by routes other than intravenous administration has not been established.



 Mitoxantrone is not indicated for subcutaneous, intramuscular, or intra-arterial injection.  There have been reports of local/regional neuropathy, some irreversible, following intra-arterial injection.



 Mitoxantrone must not be given by intrathecal injection.  There have been reports of neuropathy and neurotoxicity, both central and peripheral, following intrathecal injection.  These reports have included seizures leading to coma and severe neurologic sequelae, and paralysis with bowel and bladder dysfunction.



 Topoisomerase II inhibitors, including mitoxantrone, have been associated with the development of secondary acute myeloid leukemia and myelosuppression.



      Cardiac Effects    



  Because of the possible danger of cardiac effects in patients previously treated with daunorubicin or doxorubicin, the benefit-to-risk ratio of mitoxantrone therapy in such patients should be determined before starting therapy.



 Functional cardiac changes including decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and irreversible congestive heart failure can occur with mitoxantrone.  Cardiac toxicity may be more common in patients with prior treatment with anthracyclines, prior mediastinal radiotherapy, or with pre-existing cardiovascular disease.  Such patients should have regular cardiac monitoring of LVEF from the initiation of therapy.  Cancer patients who received cumulative doses of 140 mg/m  2  either alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents had a cumulative 2.6% probability of clinical congestive heart failure.  In comparative oncology trials, the overall cumulative probability rate of moderate or severe decreases in LVEF at this dose was 13%.



   Multiple Sclerosis    



 Changes in cardiac function may occur in patients with multiple sclerosis treated with mitoxantrone. In one controlled trial (Study 1, see   CLINICAL TRIALS   ,     Multiple Sclerosis      ), two patients (2%) of 127 receiving mitoxantrone, one receiving a 5 mg/m  2  dose and the other receiving the 12 mg/m  2  dose, had LVEF values that decreased to below 50%. An additional patient receiving 12 mg/m  2  , who did not have LVEF measured, had a decrease in another echocardiographic measurement of ventricular function (fractional shortening) that led to discontinuation from the trial (see    ADVERSE REACTIONS       ,      Multiple Sclerosis      ). There were no reports of congestive heart failure in either controlled trial.



 MS patients should be assessed for cardiac signs and symptoms by history, physical examination, ECG, and quantitative LVEF evaluation using appropriate methodology (ex. Echocardiogram, MUGA, MRI, etc.) prior to the start of mitoxantrone therapy. MS patients with a baseline LVEF below the lower limit of normal should not be treated with mitoxantrone. Subsequent LVEF and ECG evaluations are recommended if signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure develop and prior to every dose administered to MS patients.  Mitoxantrone should not be administered to MS patients who experience a reduction in LVEF to below the lower limit of normal, to those who experience a clinically significant reduction in LVEF, or to those who have received a cumulative lifetime dose of 140 mg/m  2  .  MS patients should have yearly quantitative LVEF evaluation after stopping mitoxantrone to monitor for late-occurring cardiotoxicity. 



   Leukemia    



 Acute congestive heart failure may occasionally occur in patients treated with mitoxantrone for ANLL.  In first-line comparative trials of mitoxantrone + cytarabine vs. daunorubicin + cytarabine in adult patients with previously untreated ANLL, therapy was associated with congestive heart failure in 6.5% of patients on each arm.  A causal relationship between drug therapy and cardiac effects is difficult to establish in this setting since myocardial function is frequently depressed by the anemia, fever and infection, and hemorrhage that often accompany the underlying disease.



   Hormone-Refractory Prostate Cancer    



 Functional cardiac changes such as decreases in LVEF and congestive heart failure may occur in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer treated with mitoxantrone.  In a randomized comparative trial of mitoxantrone plus low-dose prednisone vs. low-dose prednisone, 7 of 128 patients (5.5 %) treated with mitoxantrone had a cardiac event defined as any decrease in LVEF below the normal range, congestive heart failure (n = 3), or myocardial ischemia.  Two patients had a prior history of cardiac disease.  The total mitoxantrone dose administered to patients with cardiac effects ranged from &gt; 48 to 212 mg/m  2  .



 Among 112 patients evaluable for safety on the mitoxantrone + hydrocortisone arm of the CALGB trial, 18 patients (19%) had a reduction in cardiac function, 5 patients (5%) had cardiac ischemia, and 2 patients (2%) experienced pulmonary edema.  The range of total mitoxantrone doses administered to these patients is not available.



      Pregnancy    



  Mitoxantrone may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.  Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant.  Mitoxantrone is considered a potential human teratogen because of its mechanism of action and the developmental effects demonstrated by related agents.  Treatment of pregnant rats during the organogenesis period of gestation was associated with fetal growth retardation at doses &gt;= 0.1 mg/kg/day (0.01 times the recommended human dose on a mg/m  2  basis). When pregnant rabbits were treated during organogenesis, an increased incidence of premature delivery was observed at doses &gt;= 0.1 mg/kg/day (0.01 times the recommended human dose on a mg/m  2  basis).  No teratogenic effects were observed in these studies, but the maximum doses tested were well below the recommended human dose (0.02 and 0.05 times in rats and rabbits, respectively, on a mg/m  2  basis).  There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.  Women with multiple sclerosis who are biologically capable of becoming pregnant should have a pregnancy test prior to each dose, and the results should be known prior to administration of the drug.  If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential risk to the fetus.



      Secondary Leukemia    



  Mitoxantrone therapy increases the risk of developing secondary leukemia in patients with cancer and in patients with multiple sclerosis.



 In a study of patients with prostate cancer, acute myeloid leukemia occurred in 1% (5/487) of mitoxantrone-treated patients versus no cases in the control group (0/496) not receiving mitoxantrone at 4.7 years follow-up.



 In a prospective, open-label, tolerability and safety monitoring study of mitoxantrone treated MS patients followed for up to five years (median of 2.8 years), leukemia occurred in 0.6% (3/509) of patients.  Publications describe leukemia risks of 0.25% to 2.8% in cohorts of patients with MS treated with mitoxantrone and followed for varying periods of time.  This leukemia risk exceeds the risk of leukemia in the general population.  The most commonly reported types were acute promyelocytic leukemia and acute myelocytic leukemia.



 In 1774 patients with breast cancer who received mitoxantrone concomitantly with other cytotoxic agents and radiotherapy, the cumulative risk of developing treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia was estimated as 1.1% and 1.6% at 5 and 10 years, respectively.  The second largest report involved 449 patients with breast cancer treated with mitoxantrone, usually in combination with radiotherapy and/or other cytotoxic agents.  In this study, the cumulative probability of developing secondary leukemia was estimated to be 2.2% at 4 years.



 Secondary acute myeloid leukemia has also been reported in cancer patients treated with anthracyclines.  Mitoxantrone is an anthracenedione, a related drug.  The occurrence of secondary leukemia is more common when anthracyclines are given in combination with DNA-damaging antineoplastic agents, when patients have been heavily pretreated with cytotoxic drugs, or when doses of anthracyclines have been escalated.



 Symptoms of acute leukemia may include excessive bruising, bleeding, and recurrent infections.
