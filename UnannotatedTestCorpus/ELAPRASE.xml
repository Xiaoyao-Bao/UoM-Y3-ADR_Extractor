  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling:



 *  Hypersensitivity Reactions Including Anaphylaxis [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  
    In clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions (&gt;10%) following ELAPRASE treatment were hypersensitivity reactions, and included rash, urticaria, pruritus, flushing, pyrexia, and headache. Most hypersensitivity reactions requiring intervention were ameliorated with slowing of the infusion rate, temporarily stopping the infusion, with or without administering additional treatments including antihistamines, corticosteroids, or both prior to or during infusions.
 

 In clinical trials, the most frequent serious adverse reactions following ELAPRASE treatment were hypoxic episodes. Other notable serious adverse reactions that occurred in the ELAPRASE-treated patients but not in the placebo-treated patients included one case each of: cardiac arrhythmia, pulmonary embolism, cyanosis, respiratory failure, infection, and arthralgia.



       Clinical Trials in Patients 5 Years and Older    



 A 53-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of ELAPRASE was conducted in 96 male patients with Hunter syndrome, ages 5-31 years old. Of the 96 patients, 83% were White, non-Hispanic. Patients were randomized to three treatment groups, each with 32 patients: ELAPRASE 0.5 mg/kg once weekly, ELAPRASE 0.5 mg/kg every other week, or placebo. Hypersensitivity reactions were reported in 69% (22 of 32) of patients who received once-weekly treatment of ELAPRASE.



 Table 1 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred in at least 9% of patients (&gt;=3 patients) in the ELAPRASE 0.5 mg/kg once weekly group and with a higher incidence than in the placebo group.

         Additional adverse reactions that occurred in at least 9% of patients (&gt;=3 patients) in the ELAPRASE 0.5 mg/kg every other week group and with a higher incidence than in the placebo group included: rash (19%), flushing (16%), fatigue (13%), tachycardia (9%), and chills (9%).
 

     Extension Trial  



 An open-label extension trial was conducted in patients who completed the placebo-controlled trial. Ninety-four of the 96 patients who were enrolled in the placebo-controlled trial consented to participate in the extension trial. All 94 patients received ELAPRASE 0.5 mg/kg once weekly for 24 months. No new serious adverse reactions were reported. Approximately half (53%) of patients experienced hypersensitivity reactions during the 24-month extension trial. In addition to the adverse reactions listed in Table 1, common hypersensitivity reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients (&gt;=5 patients) in the extension trial included: rash (23%), pyrexia (9%), flushing (7%), erythema (7%), nausea (5%), dizziness (5%), vomiting (5%), and hypotension (5%).



       Clinical Trial in Patients 7 Years and Younger    



 A 53-week, open-label, single-arm, safety trial of once weekly ELAPRASE 0.5 mg/kg treatment was conducted in patients with Hunter syndrome, ages 16 months to 4 years old (n=20) and ages 5 to 7.5 years old (n=8) at enrollment. Patients experienced similar adverse reactions as those observed in clinical trials in patients 5 years and older, with the most common adverse reactions following ELAPRASE treatment being hypersensitivity reactions (57%). A higher incidence of the following common hypersensitivity reactions were reported in this younger age group: pyrexia (36%), rash (32%), and vomiting (14%). The most common serious adverse reactions occurring in at least 10% of patients (&gt;=3 patients) included: bronchopneumonia/pneumonia (18%), ear infection (11%), and pyrexia (11%).



 Twenty-seven patients had results of genotype analysis: 15 patients had complete gene deletion, large gene rearrangement, nonsense, frameshift, or splice site mutations and 12 patients had missense mutations.



 Safety results demonstrated that patients with complete gene deletion, large gene rearrangement, nonsense, frameshift, or splice site mutations are more likely to experience hypersensitivity reactions and have serious adverse reactions following ELAPRASE administration, compared to patients with missense mutations. Table 2 summarizes these findings.

                6.2 Immunogenicity
       Clinical Trials in Patients 5 Years and Older    



 As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. In clinical trials in patients 5 years and older, 63 of the 64 patients treated with ELAPRASE 0.5 mg/kg once weekly or placebo for 53 weeks, followed by ELAPRASE 0.5 mg/kg once weekly in the extension trial, had immunogenicity data available for analysis. Of the 63 patients, 32 (51%) patients tested positive for anti-idursulfase IgG antibodies (Ab) at least one time (Table 2). Of the 32 Ab-positive patients, 23 (72%) tested positive for Ab at three or more different time points (persistent Ab). The incidence of hypersensitivity reactions was higher in patients who tested positive for Ab than those who tested negative.



 Thirteen of 32 (41%) Ab-positive patients also tested positive for antibodies that neutralize idursulfase uptake into cells (uptake neutralizing antibodies, uptake NAb) or enzymatic activity (activity NAb) at least one time, and 8 (25%) of Ab-positive patients had persistent NAb. There was no clear relationship between the presence of either Ab or NAb and therapeutic response.



       Clinical Trial in Patients 7 Years and Younger    



 In the clinical trial in patients 7 years and younger, 19 of 28 (68%) patients treated with ELAPRASE 0.5 mg/kg once weekly tested Ab-positive. Of the 19 Ab-positive patients, 16 (84%) tested positive for Ab at three or more different time points (persistent Ab). In addition, 15 of 19 (79%) Ab-positive patients tested positive for NAb, with 14 of 15 (93%) NAb-positive patients having persistent NAb.



 All 15 patients with complete gene deletion, large gene rearrangement, nonsense, frameshift, or splice site mutations tested positive for Ab (Table 2). Of these 15 patients, neutralizing antibodies were observed in 13 (87%) patients. The NAbs in these patients developed earlier (most reported to be positive at Week 9 rather than at Week 27, as reported in clinical trials in patients older than 5 years of age) and were associated with higher titers and greater  in vitro  neutralizing activity than in patients older than 5 years of age. The presence of Ab was associated with reduced systemic idursulfase exposure  [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  .



 The immunogenicity data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were positive for antibodies to idursulfase in specific assays, and are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of these assays. The observed incidence of positive antibody in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medication, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to idursulfase with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.



   6.3 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ELAPRASE. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 In post-marketing experience, late-emergent symptoms and signs of anaphylactic reactions have occurred up to 24 hours after initial treatment and recovery from an initial anaphylactic reaction. In addition, patients experienced repeated anaphylaxis over a two- to four-month period, up to several years after initiating ELAPRASE treatment  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  .



 A seven year-old male patient with Hunter syndrome, who received ELAPRASE at twice the recommended dosage (1 mg/kg weekly) for 1.5 years, experienced two anaphylactic events after 4.5 years of treatment. Treatment has been withdrawn  [see  Overdosage (10)  ]  .



 Serious adverse reactions that resulted in death included cardiorespiratory arrest, respiratory failure, respiratory distress, cardiac failure, and pneumonia.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: RISK OF ANAPHYLAXIS

    WARNING: RISK OF ANAPHYLAXIS  

    Life-threatening anaphylactic reactions have occurred in some patients during and up to 24 hours after ELAPRASE infusions. Anaphylaxis, presenting as respiratory distress, hypoxia, hypotension, urticaria and/or angioedema of throat or tongue have been reported to occur during and after ELAPRASE infusions, regardless of duration of the course of treatment. Closely observe patients during and after ELAPRASE administration and be prepared to manage anaphylaxis. Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis and have them seek immediate medical care should symptoms occur. Patients with compromised respiratory function or acute respiratory disease may be at risk of serious acute exacerbation of their respiratory compromise due to hypersensitivity reactions, and require additional monitoring   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1  ,   5.3)   and   Adverse Reactions (6)  ]  .

   EXCERPT:    *   Hypersensitivity Reactions Including Anaphylaxis : Ensure that personnel administering product are adequately trained in cardio-pulmonary resuscitative measures, and have ready access to emergency medical services (EMS) (  5.1  ). 
 *   Risk of Hypersensitivity, Serious Adverse Reactions, and Antibody Development in Hunter Syndrome Patients with Severe Genetic Mutations : Hunter syndrome patients aged 7 years and younger with complete gene deletion, large gene rearrangement, nonsense, frameshift, or splice site mutations experienced a higher incidence of hypersensitivity reactions, serious adverse reactions, and anti-idursulfase antibody development (  5.2  ). 
 *   Risk of Acute Respiratory Complications : Patients with compromised respiratory function or acute febrile or respiratory illness may be at higher risk of life-threatening complications from hypersensitivity reactions. Careful consideration should be given to the patient's clinical status prior to administration of ELAPRASE and consider delaying the ELAPRASE infusion (  5.3  ). 
    
 

   5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Including Anaphylaxis



  Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have occurred during and up to 24 hours after infusion. Some of these reactions were life-threatening and included respiratory distress, hypoxia, hypotension, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat or tongue, regardless of duration of the course of treatment.



 If anaphylactic or other acute reactions occur, immediately discontinue the infusion of ELAPRASE and initiate appropriate medical treatment. When severe reactions have occurred during clinical trials, subsequent infusions were managed with antihistamine and/or corticosteroids prior to or during infusions, a slower rate of ELAPRASE infusion, and/or early discontinuation of the ELAPRASE infusion [see  Adverse Reactions (6)  ]  .



 In clinical trials with ELAPRASE, 16 of 108 (15%) patients experienced hypersensitivity reactions during 26 of 8,274 infusions (0.3%) that involved adverse events in at least two of the following three body systems: cutaneous, respiratory, or cardiovascular. Of these 16 patients, 11 experienced anaphylactic reactions during 19 of 8,274 infusions (0.2%) with symptoms of bronchospasm, cyanosis, dyspnea, erythema, edema (facial and peripheral), flushing, rash, respiratory distress, urticaria, vomiting, and wheezing.



 In postmarketing reports, patients receiving ELAPRASE experienced anaphylactic reactions up to several years after initiating treatment. Some patients were reported to have repeated anaphylactic events over a two- to four-month time period. Medical management included treatment with antihistamines, inhaled beta-adrenergic agonists, corticosteroids, oxygen, and vasopressors. Treatment was discontinued for some patients, while others continued treatment with premedication and a slower infusion rate.



 Due to the potential for severe reactions, appropriate medical support should be readily available when ELAPRASE is administered. Observe patients closely for an appropriate period of time after administration of ELAPRASE, taking into account the time to onset of anaphylaxis seen in premarketing clinical trials and postmarketing reports. Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis, and instruct them to seek immediate medical care should signs and symptoms occur.



    5.2 Risk of Hypersensitivity, Serious Adverse Reactions, and Antibody Development in Hunter Syndrome Patients with Severe Genetic Mutations



  In the clinical trial of Hunter syndrome patients aged 7 years and younger, patients with complete gene deletion, large gene rearrangement, nonsense, frameshift, or splice site mutations experienced a higher incidence of hypersensitivity reactions, serious adverse reactions, and anti-idursulfase antibody development than Hunter syndrome patients with missense mutations. Eleven of 15 (73%) patients with complete gene deletion, large gene rearrangement, nonsense, frameshift, or splice site mutations and five of 12 (42%) patients with missense mutations experienced hypersensitivity reactions. Nine of 15 (60%) patients with complete gene deletion, large gene rearrangement, nonsense, frameshift, or splice site mutations and two of 12 (17%) patients with missense mutations had serious adverse reactions. All 15 patients with complete gene deletion, large gene rearrangement, nonsense, frameshift, or splice site mutations developed anti-idursulfase (ELAPRASE) antibodies, compared to only 3 patients with missense mutations (Table 2). Thirteen patients with these mutations developed neutralizing antibodies, which interfere with ELAPRASE uptake into the cell or ELAPRASE enzyme activity, compared to only one patient with missense mutation [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ,  Adverse Reactions (6.1  ,  6.2)  , and  Use in Specific Populations (8.4)  ]  .



    5.3 Risk of Acute Respiratory Complications



  Patients with compromised respiratory function or acute febrile or respiratory illness at the time of ELAPRASE infusion may be at higher risk of life-threatening complications from hypersensitivity reactions. Careful consideration should be given to the patient's clinical status prior to administration of ELAPRASE and consider delaying the ELAPRASE infusion. One patient with a tracheostomy, severe airway disease, and acute febrile illness experienced respiratory distress, hypoxia, cyanosis, and seizure with a loss of consciousness during ELAPRASE infusion.



    5.4 Risk of Acute Cardiorespiratory Failure



  Caution should be exercised when administering ELAPRASE to patients susceptible to fluid overload, or patients with acute underlying respiratory illness or compromised cardiac and/or respiratory function for whom fluid restriction is indicated. These patients may be at risk of serious exacerbation of their cardiac or respiratory status during infusions. Appropriate medical support and monitoring measures should be readily available during ELAPRASE infusion, and some patients may require prolonged observation times that should be based on the individual needs of the patient [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1  ,  6.3)  ]  .
