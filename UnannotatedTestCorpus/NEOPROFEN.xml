           6.2 Renal Function
   Compared to placebo, there was a small decrease in urinary output in the ibuprofen group on days 2-6 of life, with a compensatory increase in urine output on day 9. In other studies, adverse events classified as renal insufficiency including oliguria, elevated BUN, elevated creatinine, or renal failure were reported in ibuprofen treated infants.



   6.3 Additional Adverse Events

  The adverse events reported in the multicenter study and of unknown association include tachycardia, cardiac failure, abdominal distension, gastroesophageal reflux, gastritis, ileus, inguinal hernia, injection site reactions, cholestasis, various infections, feeding problems, convulsions, jaundice, hypotension, and various laboratory abnormalities including neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and hyperglycemia.



   6.4 Post-marketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified from spontaneous post-marketing reports or published literature: gastrointestinal perforation and necrotizing enterocolitis. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency, or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  NeoProfen has not been assessed for neurodevelopmental outcome and growth 
 *  NeoProfen may alter the usual signs of infection. 
 *  NeoProfen can inhibit platelet aggregation, and has been shown to prolong bleeding time in normal adult subjects 
 *  Ibuprofen has been shown to displace bilirubin from albumin binding-sites 
 *  NeoProfen should be administered carefully to avoid extravascular injection or leakage 
    
 

   5.1 General



  There are no long-term evaluations of the infants treated with ibuprofen at durations greater than the 36 weeks post-conceptual age observation period. Ibuprofen's effects on neurodevelopmental outcome and growth as well as disease processes associated with prematurity (such as retinopathy of prematurity and chronic lung disease) have not been assessed.



    5.2 Infection



  NeoProfen may alter the usual signs of infection. The physician must be continually on the alert and should use the drug with extra care in the presence of controlled infection and in infants at risk of infection.



    5.3 Platelet Aggregation



  NeoProfen, like other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, can inhibit platelet aggregation. Preterm infants should be observed for signs of bleeding. Ibuprofen has been shown to prolong bleeding time (but within the normal range) in normal adult subjects. This effect may be exaggerated in patients with underlying hemostatic defects (see  CONTRAINDICATIONS  ).



    5.4 Bilirubin Displacement



  Ibuprofen has been shown to displace bilirubin from albumin binding-sites; therefore, it should be used with caution in patients with elevated total bilirubin.



    5.5 Administration



  NeoProfen should be administered carefully to avoid extravascular injection or leakage, as solution may be irritating to tissue.
