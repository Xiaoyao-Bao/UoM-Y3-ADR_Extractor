  Benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide has been evaluated for safety in over 2500 patients with hypertension; over 500 of these patients were treated for at least 6 months, and over 200 were treated for more than 1 year.



 The reported side effects were generally mild and transient, and there was no relationship between side effects and age, sex, race, or duration of therapy. Discontinuation of therapy due to side effects was required in approximately 7% of U.S. patients treated with benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide and in 4% of patients treated with placebo.



 The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide in U.S. studies were cough (1.0%; see    PRECAUTIONS    ), "dizziness" (1.0%), headache (0.6%), and fatigue (0.6%).



 The side effects considered possibly or probably related to study drug that occurred in U.S. placebo-controlled trials in more than 1% of patients treated with benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide are shown in the table below.

           Other side effects considered possibly or probably related to study drug that occurred in U.S. placebo-controlled trials in 0.3% to 1.0% of patients treated with benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide were the following:
 

     Angioedema:    Edema of the lips or face without other manifestations of angioedema (0.3%). See    WARNINGS, Head and Neck Angioedema.    



     Cardiovascular:    Hypotension (seen in 0.6% of patients), postural hypotension (0.3%), palpitations, and flushing.



     Gastrointestinal:    Vomiting, diarrhea, dyspepsia, anorexia, and constipation.



     Neurologic and Psychiatric:    Insomnia, nervousness, paresthesia, libido decrease, dry mouth, taste perversion, and tinnitus.



     Dermatologic:    Rash and sweating.



     Other:    Gout, urinary frequency, arthralgia, myalgia, asthenia, and pain (including chest pain and abdominal pain).



 Other adverse experiences reported in 0.3% or more of benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide patients in U.S. controlled clinical trials, and rarer events seen in postmarketing experience, were the following; asterisked entries occurred in more than 1% of patients (in some, a causal relationship to benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide is uncertain):



     Angioedema:    Edema of the lips or face without other manifestations of angioedema. See    WARNINGS, Head and Neck Angioedema.    



     Cardiovascular:    Syncope, peripheral vascular disorder, and tachycardia.



     Body as a Whole:    Infection, back pain,* flu syndrome,* fever, chills, and neck pain.



     Dermatologic:    Photosensitivity and pruritus.



     Gastrointestinal:    Gastroenteritis, flatulence, and tooth disorder.



     Neurologic and Psychiatric:    Hypesthesia, abnormal vision, abnormal dreams, and retinal disorder.



     Respiratory:    Upper respiratory infection,* epistaxis, bronchitis, rhinitis,* sinusitis,* and voice alteration.



     Other:    Conjunctivitis, arthritis, urinary tract infection, alopecia, and urinary frequency.*



   Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality:  See    WARNINGS, Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality    



 Monotherapy with  benazepril  has been evaluated for safety in over 6000 patients. In clinical trials, the observed adverse reactions to benazepril were similar to those seen in trials of benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide. In postmarketing experience with benazepril, there have been rare reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, pemphigus, and thrombocytopenia. Another potentially important adverse experience, eosinophilic pneumonitis, has been attributed to other ACE inhibitors.



   Hydrochlorothiazide  has been extensively prescribed for many years, but there has not been enough systematic collection of data to support an estimate of the frequency of the observed adverse reactions. Within organ-system groups, the reported reactions are listed here in decreasing order of severity, without regard to frequency.



     Cardiovascular:    Orthostatic hypotension (may be potentiated by alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics).



     Digestive:    Pancreatitis, jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic) (see    WARNINGS    ), sialadenitis, vomiting, diarrhea, cramping, nausea, gastric irritation, constipation, and anorexia.



     Neurologic:    Vertigo, lightheadedness, transient blurred vision, headache, paresthesia, xanthopsia, weakness, and restlessness.



     Musculoskeletal:    Muscle spasm.



     Hematologic:    Aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia.



     Metabolic:    Hyperglycemia, glycosuria, and hyperuricemia.



     Hypersensitivity:    Necrotizing angiitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, respiratory distress (including pneumonitis and pulmonary edema), purpura, urticaria, rash, and photosensitivity.



   Clinical Laboratory Test Findings  



     Serum Electrolytes:    See    PRECAUTIONS  .  



     Creatinine:    Minor reversible increases in serum creatinine were observed in patients with essential hypertension treated with benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide. Such increases occurred most frequently in patients with renal artery stenosis (see    PRECAUTIONS    ).



     PBI and Tests of Parathyroid Function:    See    PRECAUTIONS  .  



     Other (Causal Relationships Unknown):    Other clinically important changes in standard laboratory tests were rarely associated with benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide administration. Elevations in blood urea nitrogen, uric acid, glucose, SGOT, and SGPT (see    WARNINGS    ) have been reported. In the somewhat larger patient population exposed to benazepril monotherapy in U.S. trials, the same abnormalities were reported, together with scattered accounts of hyponatremia, melena, electrocardiographic changes, leukopenia, eosinophilia, and proteinuria.

    BOXED WARNING: USE IN PREGNANCY

  USE IN PREGNANCY

    When used in pregnancy during the second and third trimesters, ACE inhibitors can cause injury and even death to the developing fetus.   When pregnancy is detected, benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be discontinued as soon as possible. See     WARNINGS, Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality  .

    <Section id="S3" name="precautions">    PRECAUTIONS



   General



    Derangements of Serum Electrolytes:    In clinical trials of benazepril monotherapy, hyperkalemia (serum potassium at least 0.5 mEq/L greater than the upper limit of normal) occurred in approximately 1% of hypertensive patients receiving benazepril. In most cases, these were isolated values, which resolved despite continued therapy. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia included renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, and/or potassium-containing salt substitutes.



 Conversely, treatment with thiazide diuretics has been associated with hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and hypochloremic alkalosis. These disturbances have sometimes been manifest as one or more of dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, nausea, and vomiting. Hypokalemia can also sensitize or exaggerate the response of the heart to the toxic effects of digitalis. The risk of hypokalemia is greatest in patients with cirrhosis of the liver, in patients experiencing a brisk diuresis, in patients who are receiving inadequate oral intake of electrolytes, and in patients receiving concomitant therapy with corticosteroids or ACTH.



 The opposite effects of benazepril and hydrochlorothiazide on serum potassium will approximately balance each other in many patients, so that no net effect upon serum potassium will be seen. In other patients, one or the other effect may be dominant. Initial and periodic determinations of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals.



 Chloride deficits are generally mild and require specific treatment only under extraordinary circumstances (e.g., in liver disease or renal disease). Dilutional hyponatremia may occur in edematous patients; appropriate therapy is water restriction rather than administration of salt, except in rare instances when the hyponatremia is life-threatening. In actual salt depletion, appropriate replacement is the therapy of choice.



 Calcium excretion is decreased by thiazides. In a few patients on prolonged thiazide therapy, pathological changes in the parathyroid gland have been observed, with hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia. More serious complications of hyperparathyroidism (renal lithiasis, bone resorption, and peptic ulceration) have not been seen.



 Thiazides increase the urinary excretion of magnesium, and hypomagnesemia may result.



     Other Metabolic Disturbances:    Thiazide diuretics tend to reduce glucose tolerance and to raise serum levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and uric acid. These effects are usually minor, but frank gout or overt diabetes may be precipitated in susceptible patients.



     Cough:    Presumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, always resolving after discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough.



     Surgery/Anesthesia:    In patients undergoing surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, benazepril will block the angiotensin II formation that could otherwise occur secondary to compensatory renin release. Hypotension that occurs as a result of this mechanism can be corrected by volume expansion.



    Information for Patients



    Angioedema:    Angioedema, including laryngeal edema, can occur at any time with treatment with ACE inhibitors. A patient receiving benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide should be told to report immediately any signs or symptoms suggesting angioedema (swelling of face, eyes, lips, or tongue, or difficulty in breathing) and to take no more drug until after consulting with the prescribing physician.



     Pregnancy:    Female patients of childbearing age should be told about the consequences of second- and third-trimester exposure to ACE inhibitors, and they should also be told that these consequences do not appear to have resulted from intrauterine ACE-inhibitor exposure that has been limited to the first trimester. These patients should be asked to report pregnancies to their physicians as soon as possible.



     Symptomatic Hypotension:    A patient receiving benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide should be cautioned that lightheadedness can occur, especially during the first days of therapy, and that it should be reported to the prescribing physician. The patient should be told that if syncope occurs, benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide should be discontinued until the physician has been consulted.



 All patients should be cautioned that inadequate fluid intake, excessive perspiration, diarrhea, or vomiting can lead to an excessive fall in blood pressure, with the same consequences of lightheadedness and possible syncope.



     Hyperkalemia:    A patient receiving benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide should be told not to use potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium without consulting the prescribing physician.



     Neutropenia:    Patients should be told to promptly report any indication of infection (e.g., sore throat, fever), which could be a sign of neutropenia.



    Laboratory Tests



  The hydrochlorothiazide component of benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide may decrease serum PBI levels without signs of thyroid disturbance.



 Therapy with benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide should be interrupted for a few days before carrying out tests of parathyroid function.



    Drug Interactions



    Potassium Supplements and Potassium-Sparing Diuretics:    As noted above (Derangements of Serum Electrolytes), the net effect of benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide may be to elevate a patient's serum potassium, to reduce it, or to leave it unchanged. Potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene, and others) or potassium supplements can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. If concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be given with caution, and the patient's serum potassium should be monitored frequently.



     Lithium:    Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. Because renal clearance of lithium is reduced by thiazides, the risk of lithium toxicity is presumably raised further when, as in therapy with benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic is coadministered with the ACE inhibitor. Benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide and lithium should be coadministered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended.



     Other:    Benazepril has been used concomitantly with beta-adrenergic-blocking agents, calcium-blocking agents, cimetidine, diuretics, digoxin, hydralazine, and naproxen without evidence of clinically important adverse interactions. Other ACE inhibitors have had less than additive effects with beta-adrenergic blockers, presumably because drugs of both classes lower blood pressure by inhibiting parts of the renin-angiotensin system.



 Interaction studies with warfarin and acenocoumarol have failed to identify any clinically important effects of benazepril on the serum concentrations or clinical effects of these anticoagulants.



 Insulin requirements in diabetic patients may be increased, decreased, or unchanged.



 Thiazides may decrease arterial responsiveness to norepinephrine, but not enough to preclude effectiveness of the pressor agent for therapeutic use.



 Thiazides may increase the responsiveness to tubocurarine.



 The diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics may be reduced by concurrent administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents.



    Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resins:  Absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively.



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility



  No evidence of carcinogenicity was found when benazepril  was given to rats and mice for 104 weeks at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day. On a body-weight basis, this dose is over 100 times the maximum recommended human dose; on a body-surface-area basis, this dose is 18 times (rats) and 9 times (mice) the maximum recommended human dose. No mutagenic activity was detected in the Ames test in bacteria (with or without metabolic activation), in an in vitro  test for forward mutations in cultured mammalian cells, or in a nucleus anomaly test. At doses of 50-500 mg/kg/day (38-375 times the maximum recommended human dose on a body-weight basis; 6-61 times the maximum recommended dose on a body-surface-area basis), benazepril had no adverse effect on the reproductive performance of male and female rats.



 Under the auspices of the National Toxicology Program, rats and mice received hydrochlorothiazide  in their feed for two years, at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day in mice and up to 100 mg/kg/day in rats. These studies uncovered no evidence of a carcinogenic potential of hydrochlorothiazide in rats or female mice, but there was equivocal evidence of hepatocarcinogenicity in male mice. Hydrochlorothiazide was not genotoxic in in vitro  assays using strains TA 98, TA 100, TA 1535, TA 1537, and TA 1538 of Salmonella typhimurium  (the Ames test); in the Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) test for chromosomal aberrations; or in in vivo  assays using mouse germinal cell chromosomes, Chinese hamster bone marrow chromosomes, and the Drosophila  sex-linked recessive lethal trait gene. Positive test results were obtained in the in vitro CHO Sister Chromatid Exchange (clastogenicity) test and in the Mouse Lymphoma Cell (mutagenicity) assays, using concentrations of hydrochlorothiazide of 43-1300 mu  g/mL. Positive test results were also obtained in the Aspergillus nidulans  nondisjunction assay, using an unspecified concentration of hydrochlorothiazide.



 Hydrochlorothiazide had no adverse effects on the fertility of mice and rats of either sex in studies wherein these species were exposed, via their diets, to doses up to 100 and 4 mg/kg/day, respectively, prior to mating and throughout gestation.



    Pregnancy



   Pregnancy Categories C (first trimester) and D (second and third trimesters): See  WARNINGS, Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality  .  



    Nursing Mothers



  Minimal amounts of unchanged benazepril and of benazeprilat are excreted into the breast milk of lactating women treated with benazepril, so that a newborn child ingesting nothing but breast milk would receive less than 0.1% of the maternal doses of benazepril and benazeprilat. Thiazides, on the other hand, are definitely excreted into breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from hydrochlorothiazide and the unknown effects of benazepril in infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.



    Geriatric Use



  Of the total number of patients who received benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide in U.S. clinical studies of benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide, 19% were 65 or older while about 1.5% were 75 or older. Overall differences in effectiveness or safety were not observed between these patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.



 Benazepril and benazeprilat are substantially excreted by the kidney. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.



    Pediatric Use



  Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.
</Section>
    <Section id="S4" name="warnings">    WARNINGS



   Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions



  Presumably because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors affect the metabolism of eicosanoids and polypeptides, including endogenous bradykinin, patients receiving ACE inhibitors (including benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide) may be subject to a variety of adverse reactions, some of them serious.



    Head and Neck Angioedema:  Angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis, and larynx has been reported in patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. In U.S. clinical trials, symptoms consistent with angioedema were seen in none of the subjects who received placebo and in about 0.5% of the subjects who received benazepril. Angioedema associated with laryngeal edema can be fatal. If laryngeal stridor or angioedema of the face, tongue, or glottis occurs, treatment with benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted immediately. When involvement of the tongue, glottis, or larynx appears likely to cause airway obstruction, appropriate therapy, e.g., subcutaneous epinephrine injection 1:1000 (0.3-0.5 mL) should be promptly administered  (see   PRECAUTIONS    and   ADVERSE REACTIONS    ).



     Intestinal Angioedema:    Intestinal angioedema has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. These patients presented with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vomiting); in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema anc C-1 esterase levels were normal. The angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angioedema should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain.



     Anaphylactoid Reactions During Desensitization:    Two patients undergoing desensitizing treatment with hymenoptera venom while receiving ACE inhibitors sustained life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions. In the same patients, these reactions were avoided when ACE inhibitors were temporarily withheld, but they reappeared upon inadvertent rechallenge.



     Anaphylactoid Reactions During Membrane Exposure:    Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in patients dialyzed with high-flux membranes and treated concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor. Anaphylactoid reactions have also been reported in patients undergoing low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate absorption.



    Hypotension  



 Benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide can cause symptomatic hypotension. Like other ACE inhibitors, benazepril has been only rarely associated with hypotension in uncomplicated hypertensive patients. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume and/or salt depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, or vomiting. Volume and/or salt depletion should be corrected before initiating therapy with benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide.



 Benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide should be used cautiously in patients receiving concomitant therapy with other antihypertensives. The thiazide component of benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide may potentiate the action of other antihypertensive drugs, especially ganglionic or peripheral adrenergic-blocking drugs. The antihypertensive effects of the thiazide component may also be enhanced in the postsympathectomy patient.



 In patients with congestive heart failure, with or without associated renal insufficiency, ACE inhibitor therapy may cause excessive hypotension, which may be associated with oliguria, azotemia, and (rarely) with acute renal failure and death. In such patients, benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide therapy should be started under close medical supervision; they should be followed closely for the first 2 weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of benazepril or diuretic is increased.



 If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position, and, if necessary, treated with intravenous infusion of physiological saline. Benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablet treatment usually can be continued following restoration of blood pressure and volume.



    Impaired Renal Function



  Benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide should be used with caution in patients with severe renal disease. Thiazides may precipitate azotemia in such patients, and the effects of repeated dosing may be cumulative.



 When the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is inhibited by benazepril, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe congestive heart failure,  whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (including benazepril) may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death.



 In a small study of hypertensive patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis,  treatment with benazepril was associated with increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine; these increases were reversible upon discontinuation of benazepril therapy, concomitant diuretic therapy, or both. When such patients are treated with benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide, renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of therapy.



 Some benazepril-treated hypertensive patients with no apparent preexisting renal vascular disease  have developed increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, usually minor and transient, especially when benazepril has been given concomitantly with a diuretic. Dosage reduction of benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide may be required. Evaluation of the hypertensive patient should always include assessment of renal function  (see   DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION    ).



    Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis



  Another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has been shown to cause agranulocytosis and bone marrow depression, rarely in uncomplicated patients (incidence probably less than once per 10,000 exposures) but more frequently (incidence possibly as great as once per 1000 exposures) in patients with renal impairment, especially those who also have collagen-vascular diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus or scleroderma. Available data from clinical trials of benazepril are insufficient to show that benazepril does not cause agranulocytosis at similar rates. Monitoring of white blood cell counts should be considered in patients with collagen-vascular disease, especially if the disease is associated with impaired renal function.



    Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality



  ACE inhibitors can cause fetal and neonatal morbidity and death when administered to pregnant women. Several dozen cases have been reported in the world literature. When pregnancy is detected, benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide should be discontinued as soon as possible.



 The use of ACE inhibitors during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy has been associated with fetal and neonatal injury, including hypotension, neonatal skull hypoplasia, anuria, reversible or irreversible renal failure, and death. Oligohydramnios has also been reported, presumably resulting from decreased fetal renal function; oligohydramnios in this setting has been associated with fetal limb contractures, craniofacial deformation, and hypoplastic lung development. Prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation, and patent ductus arteriosus have also been reported, although it is not clear whether these occurrences were due to the ACE-inhibitor exposure.



 These adverse effects do not appear to have resulted from intrauterine ACE-inhibitor exposure that has been limited to the first trimester. Mothers whose embryos and fetuses are exposed to ACE inhibitors only during the first trimester should be so informed. Nonetheless, when patients become pregnant, physicians should make every effort to discontinue the use of benazepril as soon as possible.



 Rarely (probably less often than once in every thousand pregnancies), no alternative to ACE inhibitors will be found. In these rare cases, the mothers should be apprised of the potential hazards to their fetuses, and serial ultrasound examinations should be performed to assess the intraamniotic environment.



 If oligohydramnios is observed, benazepril should be discontinued unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother. Contraction stress testing (CST), a nonstress test (NST), or biophysical profiling (BPP) may be appropriate, depending upon the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury.



 Infants with histories of in utero exposure to ACE inhibitors should be closely observed for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia. If oliguria occurs, attention should be directed toward support of blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusion or peritoneal dialysis may be required as means of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal function. Benazepril, which crosses the placenta, can theoretically be removed from the neonatal circulation by these means; there are occasional reports of benefit from these maneuvers, but experience is limited.



 Intrauterine exposure to thiazide diuretics is associated with fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and possibly other adverse reactions that have occurred in adults.



 No teratogenic effects were seen when benazepril and hydrochlorothiazide were administered to pregnant rats at a dose ratio of 4:5. On a mg/kg basis, the doses used were up to 167 times the maximum recommended human dose. Similarly, no teratogenic effects were seen when benazepril and hydrochlorothiazide were administered to pregnant mice at total doses up to 160 mg/kg/day, with benazepril:hydrochlorothiazide ratios of 15:1. When hydrochlorothiazide was orally administered without benazepril to pregnant mice and rats during their respective periods of major organogenesis, at doses up to 3000 and 1000 mg/kg/day respectively, there was no evidence of harm to the fetus. Similarly, no teratogenic effects of benazepril were seen in studies of pregnant rats, mice, and rabbits; on a mg/kg basis, the doses used in these studies were 300 times (in rats), 90 times (in mice), and more than 3 times (in rabbits) the maximum recommended human dose.



    Hepatic Failure



  Rarely, ACE inhibitors have been associated with a syndrome that starts with cholestatic jaundice and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis and (sometimes) death. The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood. Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical follow-up.



    Impaired Hepatic Function



  Benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma (see   Hepatic Failure,    above). In patients with hepatic dysfunction due to cirrhosis, levels of benazeprilat are essentially unaltered. No formal pharmacokinetic studies have been carried out in hypertensive patients with impaired liver function.



    Systemic Lupus Erythematosus



  Thiazide diuretics have been reported to cause exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus.
