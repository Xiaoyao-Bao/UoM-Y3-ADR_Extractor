    <Section id="S2" name="precautions">     PRECAUTIONS  



    General  



    *  The pretreatment physical examination should include special reference to breast and pelvic organs, as well as Papanicolaou smear. 
 *  In cases of breakthrough bleeding, as in all cases of irregular vaginal bleeding, nonfunctional causes should be considered. In cases of undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, adequate diagnostic measures should be undertaken. 
 *  Because progestogens may cause some degree of fluid retention, conditions which might be influenced by this factor (e.g., epilepsy, migraine, asthma, cardiac or renal dysfunction) require careful observation. 
 *  The pathologist should be advised of progesterone therapy when relevant specimens are submitted. 
 *  Patients who have a history of psychic depression should be carefully observed and the drug discontinued if the depression recurs to a serious degree. 
 *  A decrease in glucose tolerance has been observed in a small percentage of patients on estrogen-progestin combination drugs. The mechanism of this decrease is not known. For this reason, diabetic patients should be carefully observed while receiving progestin therapy. 
        Information for Patients  
 

  The product should not be used concurrently with other local intravaginal therapy. If other local intravaginal therapy is to be used concurrently, there should be at least a 6-hour period before or after Crinone administration. Small, white globules may appear as a vaginal discharge possibly due to gel accumulation, even several days after usage.



     Drug Interactions  



  No drug interactions have been assessed with Crinone.



     Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  



  Nonclinical toxicity studies to determine the potential of Crinone to cause carcinogenicity or mutagenicity have not been performed. The effect of Crinone on fertility has not been evaluated in animals.



     Pregnancy  



   [See     CLINICAL STUDIES     ,     Assisted Reproductive Technology     ]  



 Crinone 8% has been used to support embryo implantation and maintain pregnancies through its use as part of ART treatment regimens in two clinical studies (studies COL1620-007US and COL1620-F01). In the first study (COL1620-007US), 54 Crinone-treated women had donor oocyte transfer procedures, and clinical pregnancies occurred in 26 women (48%). The outcomes of these 26 pregnancies were as follows: one woman had an elective termination of pregnancy at 19 weeks due to congenital malformations (omphalocele) associated with a chromosomal abnormality; one woman pregnant with triplets had an elective termination of her pregnancy; seven women had spontaneous abortions; and 17 women delivered 25 apparently normal newborns.



 In the second study (COL1620-F01), Crinone 8% was used in the luteal phase support of women undergoing in vitro  fertilization ("IVF") procedures. In this multi-center, open-label study, 139 women received Crinone 8% once daily beginning within 24 hours of embryo transfer and continuing through Day 30 post-transfer.



 Clinical pregnancies assessed at Day 90 post-transfer were seen in 36 (26%) of women. Thirty-two women (23%) delivered newborns and four women (3%) had spontaneous abortions. Of the 47 newborns delivered, one had a teratoma associated with a cleft palate; one had respiratory distress syndrome; 44 were apparently normal and one was lost to follow-up.



     Geriatric Use  



  The safety and effectiveness in geriatric patients (over age 65) have not been established.



     Pediatric Use  



  Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.



     Nursing Mothers  



  Detectable amounts of progestins have been identified in the milk of mothers receiving them. The effect of this on the nursing infant has not been determined.

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings">     WARNINGS  



  The physician should be alert to the earliest manifestations of thrombotic disorders (thrombophlebitis, cerebrovascular disorders, pulmonary embolism, and retinal thrombosis). Should any of these occur or be suspected, the drug should be discontinued immediately.



 Progesterone and progestins have been used to prevent miscarriage in women with a history of recurrent spontaneous pregnancy losses. No adequate evidence is available to show that they are effective for this purpose.
