  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The data in the Warnings and Precautions section reflect exposure to OPDIVO as a single agent in 1994 patients enrolled in the CHECKMATE-037, CHECKMATE-017, CHECKMATE-057, CHECKMATE-066, CHECKMATE-025, CHECKMATE-067, CHECKMATE-205, CHECKMATE-039 trials or a single-arm trial in NSCLC (n=117); OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg in patients enrolled in CHECKMATE-067 (n=313) or another randomized study (n=94); and OPDIVO 3 mg/kg administered with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg in 666 patients enrolled in CHECKMATE-214 or CHECKMATE-142.



 The data described below reflect exposure to OPDIVO as a single agent in 13 clinical trials (n=3063), OPDIVO with 3 mg/kg ipilimumab in 1 clinical trial (n=313), and OPDIVO with 1 mg/kg ipilimumab in 2 clinical trials (n=666)  [see  Clinical Studies (14)  ]  .



     Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma  

  Previously Treated Metastatic Melanoma

  The safety of OPDIVO as a single agent was evaluated in CHECKMATE-037, a randomized, open-label trial in which 370 patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma received 3 mg/kg of OPDIVO by intravenous infusion every 2 weeks (n=268) or investigator's choice of chemotherapy (n=102), either dacarbazine 1000 mg/m  2  every 3 weeks or the combination of carboplatin AUC 6 every 3 weeks plus paclitaxel 175 mg/m  2  every 3 weeks  [see  Clinical Studies (14.1)  ]  . The median duration of exposure was 5.3 months (range: 1 day to 13.8+ months) in OPDIVO-treated patients and was 2 months (range: 1 day to 9.6+ months) in chemotherapy-treated patients. In this ongoing trial, 24% of patients received OPDIVO for greater than 6 months and 3% of patients received OPDIVO for greater than 1 year.



 In CHECKMATE-037, patients had documented disease progression following treatment with ipilimumab and, if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor. The trial excluded patients with autoimmune disease, prior ipilimumab-related Grade 4 adverse reactions (except for endocrinopathies) or Grade 3 ipilimumab-related adverse reactions that had not resolved or were inadequately controlled within 12 weeks of the initiating event, patients with a condition requiring chronic systemic treatment with corticosteroids (&gt;10 mg daily prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications, a positive test for hepatitis B or C, and a history of HIV.



 The trial population characteristics in the OPDIVO group and the chemotherapy group were similar: 66% male, median age 59.5 years, 98% White, baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 (59%) or 1 (41%), 74% with M1c stage disease, 73% with cutaneous melanoma, 11% with mucosal melanoma, 73% received two or more prior therapies for advanced or metastatic disease, and 18% had brain metastasis. There were more patients in the OPDIVO group with elevated LDH at baseline (51% vs. 38%).



 OPDIVO was discontinued for adverse reactions in 9% of patients. Twenty-six percent of patients receiving OPDIVO had a drug delay for an adverse reaction. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 41% of patients receiving OPDIVO. Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions occurred in 42% of patients receiving OPDIVO. The most frequent Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions reported in 2% to less than 5% of patients receiving OPDIVO were abdominal pain, hyponatremia, increased aspartate aminotransferase, and increased lipase.



 Table 2 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred in at least 10% of OPDIVO-treated patients in CHECKMATE-037. The most common adverse reaction (reported in at least 20% of patients) was rash.

     CHECKMATE-066  

  The safety of OPDIVO was also evaluated in CHECKMATE-066, a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial in which 411 previously untreated patients with BRAF V600 wild-type unresectable or metastatic melanoma received 3 mg/kg of OPDIVO by intravenous infusion every 2 weeks (n=206) or dacarbazine 1000 mg/m  2  every 3 weeks (n=205)  [see  Clinical Studies (14.1)  ]  . The median duration of exposure was 6.5 months (range: 1 day to 16.6 months) in OPDIVO-treated patients. In this trial, 47% of patients received OPDIVO for greater than 6 months and 12% of patients received OPDIVO for greater than 1 year.



 The trial excluded patients with autoimmune disease and patients requiring chronic systemic treatment with corticosteroids (&gt;10 mg daily prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications.



 The trial population characteristics in the OPDIVO group and dacarbazine group: 59% male, median age 65 years, 99.5% White, 61% with M1c stage disease, 74% with cutaneous melanoma, 11% with mucosal melanoma, 4% with brain metastasis, and 37% with elevated LDH at baseline. There were more patients in the OPDIVO group with ECOG performance status 0 (71% vs. 59%).



 Adverse reactions led to permanent discontinuation of OPDIVO in 7% of patients and dose interruption in 26% of patients; no single type of adverse reaction accounted for the majority of OPDIVO discontinuations. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 36% of patients receiving OPDIVO. Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions occurred in 41% of patients receiving OPDIVO. The most frequent Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients receiving OPDIVO were gamma-glutamyltransferase increase (3.9%) and diarrhea (3.4%).



 Table 4 summarizes selected adverse reactions that occurred in at least 10% of OPDIVO-treated patients. The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients and at a higher incidence than in the dacarbazine arm) were fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, rash, and pruritus.

               CHECKMATE-067  
   The safety of OPDIVO, administered with ipilimumab or as a single agent, was evaluated in CHECKMATE-067  [see  Clinical Studies (14.1)  ]  , a randomized (1:1:1), a double-blind trial in which 937 patients with previously untreated, unresectable or metastatic melanoma received:



 *    OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 doses followed by OPDIVO 3 mg/kg as a single agent every 2 weeks (OPDIVO plus ipilimumab arm; n=313), 
 *    OPDIVO 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks (OPDIVO arm; n=313), or 
 *    Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for up to 4 doses (ipilimumab arm; n=311). 
    The median duration of exposure to OPDIVO was 2.8 months (range: 1 day to 18.8 months) for the OPDIVO plus ipilimumab arm and 6.6 months (range: 1 day to 17.3 months) for the OPDIVO arm. In the OPDIVO plus ipilimumab arm, 39% were exposed to OPDIVO for &gt;=6 months and 24% exposed for &gt;1 year. In the OPDIVO arm, 53% were exposed for &gt;=6 months and 32% for &gt;1 year.
 

 CHECKMATE-067 excluded patients with autoimmune disease, a medical condition requiring systemic treatment with corticosteroids (more than 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medication within 14 days of the start of study therapy, a positive test result for hepatitis B or C, or a history of HIV.



 The trial population characteristics were: 65% male, median age 61 years, 97% White, baseline ECOG performance status 0 (73%) or 1 (27%), 93% with AJCC Stage IV disease, 58% with M1c stage disease; 36% with elevated LDH at baseline, 4% with a history of brain metastasis, and 22% had received adjuvant therapy.



 In CHECKMATE-067, serious adverse reactions (73% and 37%), adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation (43% and 14%) or to dosing delays (55% and 28%), and Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions (72% and 44%) all occurred more frequently in the OPDIVO plus ipilimumab arm relative to the OPDIVO arm.



 The most frequent (&gt;=10%) serious adverse reactions in the OPDIVO plus ipilimumab arm and the OPDIVO arm, respectively, were diarrhea (13% and 2.6%), colitis (10% and 1.6%), and pyrexia (10% and 0.6%). The most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of both drugs in the OPDIVO plus ipilimumab arm and of OPDIVO in the OPDIVO arm, respectively, were diarrhea (8% and 1.9%), colitis (8% and 0.6%), increased ALT (4.8% and 1.3%), increased AST (4.5% and 0.6%), and pneumonitis (1.9% and 0.3%). The most common (&gt;=20%) adverse reactions in the OPDIVO plus ipilimumab arm were fatigue, rash, diarrhea, nausea, pyrexia, vomiting, and dyspnea. The most common (&gt;=20%) adverse reactions in the OPDIVO arm were fatigue, rash, diarrhea, and nausea. Table 6 summarizes the incidence of adverse reactions occurring in at least 10% of patients in either OPDIVO-containing arm in CHECKMATE-067.

   The safety of OPDIVO as a single agent was evaluated in CHECKMATE-238, a randomized (1:1), double-blind trial in which 905 patients with completely resected Stage IIIB/C or Stage IV melanoma received 3 mg/kg of OPDIVO by intravenous infusion every 2 weeks (n=452) or 10 mg/kg ipilimumab (n=453), by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks for 4 doses then every 12 weeks beginning at Week 24 for up to a 1 year  [see  Clinical Studies (14.2)  ]  . The median duration of exposure was 11.5 months in OPDIVO-treated patients and was 2.7 months in ipilimumab-treated patients. In this ongoing trial, 74% of patients received OPDIVO for greater than 6 months.



 Study therapy was discontinued for adverse reactions in 9% of OPDIVO-treated patients and 42% of ipilimumab-treated patients. Twenty-eight percent of OPDIVO-treated patients had at least one omitted dose for an adverse reaction. Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions occurred in 25% of OPDIVO-treated patients. The most frequent Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of OPDIVO-treated patients were diarrhea and increased lipase and amylase. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 18% of OPDIVO-treated patients.



 The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of OPDIVO-treated patients) were fatigue, diarrhea, rash, musculoskeletal pain, pruritus, headache, nausea, upper respiratory infection, and abdominal pain. The most common immune-mediated adverse reactions were rash (16%), diarrhea/colitis (6%), and hepatitis (3%).



 Table 8 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred in at least 10% of OPDIVO-treated patients in CHECKMATE-238.

   The safety of OPDIVO in metastatic NSCLC was evaluated in CHECKMATE-017, a randomized open-label, multicenter trial in patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC and progression on or after one prior platinum doublet-based chemotherapy regimen and in CHECKMATE-057, a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial in patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC and progression on or after one prior platinum doublet-based chemotherapy regimen  [see  Clinical Studies (14.3)  ]  . Patients received 3 mg/kg of OPDIVO over 60 minutes by intravenous infusion every 2 weeks or docetaxel administered intravenously at 75 mg/m  2  every 3 weeks. The median duration of therapy in OPDIVO-treated patients in CHECKMATE-017 was 3.3 months (range: 1 day to 21.7+ months) and in CHECKMATE-057 was 2.6 months (range: 0 to 24.0+ months). In CHECKMATE-017, 36% of patients received OPDIVO for at least 6 months and 18% of patients received OPDIVO for at least 1 year and in CHECKMATE-057, 30% of patients received OPDIVO for greater than 6 months and 20% of patients received OPDIVO for greater than 1 year.



 CHECKMATE-017 and CHECKMATE-057 excluded patients with active autoimmune disease, medical conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression, or with symptomatic interstitial lung disease.



 Across both trials, the median age of OPDIVO-treated patients was 61 years (range: 37 to 85); 38% were &gt;=65 years of age, 61% were male, and 91% were White. Ten percent of patients had brain metastases and ECOG performance status was 0 (26%) or 1 (74%).



 OPDIVO was discontinued in 11% of patients, and was delayed in 28% of patients for an adverse reaction. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 46% of patients receiving OPDIVO. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients receiving OPDIVO were pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, dyspnea, pyrexia, pleural effusion, pneumonitis, and respiratory failure. In CHECKMATE-057, in the OPDIVO arm, seven deaths were due to infection including one case of  Pneumocystis jirovecii  pneumonia, four were due to pulmonary embolism, and one death was due to limbic encephalitis. Across both trials, the most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) were fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, cough, dyspnea, and decreased appetite.



 Table 10 summarizes selected adverse reactions occurring more frequently in at least 10% of OPDIVO-treated patients.

               Small Cell Lung Cancer  
   The safety of OPDIVO in SCLC was evaluated in CHECKMATE-032, a multicenter, multi-cohort, open-label, ongoing trial that enrolled 245 patients with SCLC with disease progression after platinum-based chemotherapy who received OPDIVO 3 mg/kg administered intravenously over 60 minutes every 2 weeks  [see  Clinical Studies (14.4)  ]  . The median duration of therapy in OPDIVO-treated patients was 1 month (range: 0 to 44.2+ months): 17% of patients received OPDIVO for greater than 6 months and 9% of patients received OPDIVO for greater than one year.



 The trial excluded patients with active autoimmune disease, medical conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression, or with symptomatic interstitial lung disease.



 The population characteristics were: median age 63 years (range: 29 to 83), 92% White, and 60% male. Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (30%) or 1 (70%), 94% were former/current smokers, 56% received one prior line of therapy, and 44% received two or more prior lines of therapy.



 OPDIVO was discontinued for adverse reactions in 10% of patients and 25% of patients had at least one dose withheld for an adverse reaction. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 45% of patients. The most frequent (&gt;=2%) serious adverse reactions were pneumonia, dyspnea, pneumonitis, pleural effusion, and dehydration. The most common (&gt;=20%) adverse reactions were fatigue, decreased appetite, musculoskeletal pain, dyspnea, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and cough.



 The toxicity profile observed in patients with metastatic SCLC was generally similar to that observed in patients with other solid tumors who received OPDIVO as a single agent.



     Renal Cell Carcinoma  

    Previously Treated Renal Cell Carcinoma  



 The safety of OPDIVO was evaluated in CHECKMATE-025, a randomized open-label trial in which 803 patients with advanced RCC who had experienced disease progression during or after at least one anti-angiogenic treatment regimen received 3 mg/kg of OPDIVO by intravenous infusion every 2 weeks (n=406) or everolimus 10 mg daily (n=397)  [see  Clinical Studies (14.5)  ]  . The median duration of treatment was 5.5 months (range: 1 day to 29.6+ months) in OPDIVO-treated patients and 3.7 months (range: 6 days to 25.7+ months) in everolimus-treated patients.



 Study therapy was discontinued for adverse reactions in 16% of OPDIVO patients and 19% of everolimus patients. Forty-four percent (44%) of patients receiving OPDIVO had a drug delay for an adverse reaction. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 47% of patients receiving OPDIVO. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients were acute kidney injury, pleural effusion, pneumonia, diarrhea, and hypercalcemia.



 Rate of death on treatment or within 30 days of the last dose of study drug was 4.7% on the OPDIVO arm versus 8.6% on the everolimus arm.



 The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) were fatigue, cough, nausea, rash, dyspnea, diarrhea, constipation, decreased appetite, back pain, and arthralgia. Table 12 summarizes adverse reactions that occurred in greater than 15% of OPDIVO-treated patients.

   Previously Untreated Renal Cell Carcinoma  



 The safety of OPDIVO 3 mg/kg, administered with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg was evaluated in CHECKMATE-214, a randomized open-label trial in which 1082 patients with previously untreated advanced RCC received OPDIVO 3 mg/kg in combination with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 doses followed by OPDIVO monotherapy at the 3 mg/kg dose (n=547) every 2 weeks or sunitinib administered orally 50 mg daily for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks off, every cycle (n=535)  [see  Clinical Studies (14.5)  ]  . The median duration of treatment was 7.9 months (range: 1 day to 21.4+ months) in OPDIVO plus ipilimumab-treated patients and 7.8 months (range: 1 day to 20.2+ months) in sunitinib-treated patients. In this trial, 57% of patients in the OPDIVO plus ipilimumab arm were exposed to treatment for greater than 6 months, and 38% of patients were exposed to treatment for greater than 1 year.



 Study therapy was discontinued for adverse reactions in 31% of OPDIVO plus ipilimumab patients and in 21% of sunitinib patients. Fifty-four percent (54%) of patients receiving OPDIVO plus ipilimumab and 43% of patients receiving sunitinib had a drug delay for an adverse reaction. In the sunitinib group, 53% of patients required a dose reduction; dose reductions were not permitted in the OPDIVO plus ipilimumab treatment group. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 59% of patients receiving OPDIVO plus ipilimumab and in 43% of patients receiving sunitinib. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients treated with OPDIVO plus ipilimumab were diarrhea, pyrexia, pneumonia, pneumonitis, hypophysitis, acute kidney injury, dyspnea, adrenal insufficiency, and colitis; in patients treated with sunitinib, they were pneumonia, pleural effusion, and dyspnea.



 The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of OPDIVO plus ipilimumab-treated patients) were fatigue, rash, diarrhea, musculoskeletal pain, pruritus, nausea, cough, pyrexia, arthralgia, and decreased appetite. Table 14 summarizes adverse reactions that occurred in greater than 15% of OPDIVO plus ipilimumab-treated patients.

     Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma  

  The safety of 3 mg/kg of OPDIVO by intravenous infusion every 2 weeks was evaluated in 266 adult patients with cHL (243 patients in the CHECKMATE-205 and 23 patients in the CHECKMATE-039 trials). Treatment could continue until disease progression, maximal clinical benefit, or unacceptable toxicity.



 The median age was 34 years (range: 18 to 72), 98% of patients had received autologous HSCT, none had received allogeneic HSCT, and 74% had received brentuximab vedotin. The median number of prior systemic regimens was 4 (range: 2 to 15). Patients received a median of 23 doses (cycles) of OPDIVO (range: 1 to 48), with a median duration of therapy of 11 months (range: 0 to 23 months).



 OPDIVO was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 7% of patients. Dose delay for an adverse reaction occurred in 34% of patients. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 26% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in at least 1% of patients were pneumonia, infusion-related reaction, pyrexia, colitis or diarrhea, pleural effusion, pneumonitis, and rash. Eleven patients died from causes other than disease progression: 3 from adverse reactions within 30 days of the last nivolumab dose, 2 from infection 8 to 9 months after completing nivolumab, and 6 from complications of allogeneic HSCT.



 The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20%) among all patients were upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, cough, diarrhea, pyrexia, musculoskeletal pain, rash, nausea, and pruritus.



 Table 16 summarizes the adverse reactions, excluding laboratory terms, that occurred in at least 10% of patients in the safety population.

 Toxicity was graded per NCI CTCAE v4.  a    Includes events occurring up to 30 days after last nivolumab dose, regardless of causality. After an immune-mediated adverse reaction, reactions following nivolumab rechallenge were included if they occurred up to 30 days after completing the initial nivolumab course.  b    Includes asthenia.  c    Includes colitis.  d    Includes abdominal discomfort and upper abdominal pain.  e    Includes nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis, rhinitis, and sinusitis.  f    Includes pneumonia bacterial, pneumonia mycoplasmal, pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia.  g    Includes dermatitis, dermatitis acneiform, dermatitis exfoliative, and rash described as macular, papular, maculopapular, pruritic, exfoliative, or acneiform.  h    Includes back pain, bone pain, musculoskeletal chest pain, musculoskeletal discomfort, myalgia, neck pain, and pain in extremity.  i    Includes hyperesthesia, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, dysesthesia, peripheral motor neuropathy, peripheral sensory neuropathy, and polyneuropathy. These numbers are specific to treatment-emergent events.

         Additional information regarding clinically important adverse reactions:
 

   Immune-mediated pneumonitis:  In CHECKMATE-205 and CHECKMATE-039, pneumonitis, including interstitial lung disease, occurred in 6.0% (16/266) of patients receiving OPDIVO. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 4.9% (13/266) of patients receiving OPDIVO (one Grade 3 and 12 Grade 2). The median time to onset was 4.5 months (range: 5 days to 12 months). All 13 patients received systemic corticosteroids, with resolution in 12. Four patients permanently discontinued OPDIVO due to pneumonitis. Eight patients continued OPDIVO (three after dose delay), of whom two had recurrence of pneumonitis.



   Peripheral neuropathy:  In CHECKMATE-205 and CHECKMATE-039, treatment-emergent peripheral neuropathy was reported in 14% (31/266) of all patients receiving OPDIVO. Twenty-eight patients (11%) had new-onset peripheral neuropathy, and 3 of 40 patients had worsening of neuropathy from baseline. These adverse reactions were Grade 1 or 2, except for 1 Grade 3 event (&lt;1%). The median time to onset was 50 (range: 1 to 309) days.



   Complications of allogeneic HSCT after OPDIVO  : Of 17 patients with cHL from the CHECKMATE-205 and CHECKMATE-039 trials who underwent allogeneic HSCT after treatment with OPDIVO, 6 patients (35%) died from transplant-related complications. Five deaths occurred in the setting of severe (Grade 3 to 4) or refractory GVHD. Hyperacute GVHD occurred in 2 patients (12%) and Grade 3 or higher GVHD was reported in 5 patients (29%). Hepatic VOD occurred in 1 patient, who received reduced-intensity conditioned allogeneic HSCT and died of GVHD and multi-organ failure.



 Table 17 summarizes laboratory abnormalities that developed or worsened in at least 10% of patients with cHL. The most common (reported in at least 20%) treatment-emergent laboratory events included cytopenias, liver function abnormalities, and elevated lipase. Other common findings (reported in at least 10%) included elevated creatinine, electrolyte abnormalities, and elevated amylase.



 Table 17: Laboratory Abnormalities Worsening from Baseline Occurring in &gt;=10% of OPDIVO-Treated Patients with cHL (CHECKMATE-205 and CHECKMATE-039) 
   a    Number of evaluable patients for the safety population ranges from 203 to 266.  b    Includes events occurring up to 30 days after last nivolumab dose. After an immune-mediated adverse reaction, reactions following nivolumab rechallenge were included if they occurred within 30 days of completing the initial nivolumab course.  c    In addition, in the safety population, fasting hyperglycemia (all grade 1-2) was reported in 27 of 69 (39%) evaluable patients and fasting hypoglycemia (all grade 1-2) in 11 of 69 (16%).

             Recurrent or Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck      
   The safety of OPDIVO was evaluated in CHECKMATE-141, a randomized, active-controlled, open-label, multicenter trial in patients with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN with progression during or within 6 months of receiving prior platinum-based therapy  [see  Clinical Studies (14.7)  ]  . Patients received 3 mg/kg of OPDIVO (n=236) over 60 minutes by intravenous infusion every 2 weeks or investigator's choice of either:



 *    cetuximab (n=13), 400 mg/m  2  loading dose IV followed by 250 mg/m  2  weekly 
 *    or methotrexate (n=46) 40 to 60 mg/m  2  IV weekly, or 
 *    docetaxel (n=52) 30 to 40 mg/m  2  IV weekly. 
    The median duration of exposure to nivolumab was 1.9 months (range: 1 day to 16.1+ months) in OPDIVO-treated patients. In this trial, 18% of patients received OPDIVO for greater than 6 months and 2.5% of patients received OPDIVO for greater than 1 year.
 

 CHECKMATE-141 excluded patients with active autoimmune disease, medical conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression, or recurrent or metastatic carcinoma of the nasopharynx, squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary histology, salivary gland or non-squamous histologies (e.g., mucosal melanoma).



 The median age of all randomized patients was 60 years (range: 28 to 83); 28% of patients in the OPDIVO group were &gt;=65 years of age and 37% in the comparator group were &gt;=65 years of age, 83% were male and 83% were White, 12% were Asian, and 4% were Black. Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (20%) or 1 (78%), 45% of patients received only one prior line of systemic therapy, the remaining 55% of patients had two or more prior lines of therapy, and 90% had prior radiation therapy.



 OPDIVO was discontinued in 14% of patients and was delayed in 24% of patients for an adverse reaction. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 49% of patients receiving OPDIVO. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients receiving OPDIVO were pneumonia, dyspnea, respiratory failure, respiratory tract infection, and sepsis. Adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities occurring in patients with SCCHN were generally similar to those occurring in patients with melanoma and NSCLC. The most common adverse reactions occurring in &gt;=10% of OPDIVO-treated patients and at a higher incidence than investigator's choice were cough and dyspnea.



 The most common laboratory abnormalities occurring in &gt;=10% of OPDIVO-treated patients and at a higher incidence than investigator's choice were increased alkaline phosphatase, increased amylase, hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, and increased TSH.



     Urothelial Carcinoma      

  The safety of OPDIVO was evaluated in CHECKMATE-275, a single arm study in which 270 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma had disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy or had disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy received OPDIVO 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median duration of treatment was 3.3 months (range: 0 to 13.4+). Forty-six percent (46%) of patients had a drug delay for an adverse reaction.



 Fourteen patients (5.2%) died from causes other than disease progression. This includes 4 patients (1.5%) who died from pneumonitis or cardiovascular failure which was attributed to treatment with OPDIVO. OPDIVO was discontinued for adverse reactions in 17% of patients. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 54% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients were urinary tract infection, sepsis, diarrhea, small intestine obstruction, and general physical health deterioration.



 Twenty-five (9%) patients received an oral prednisone dose equivalent to &gt;=40 mg daily for an immune-mediated adverse reaction  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5)  ]  .



 The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) were fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, and decreased appetite.

   The safety of OPDIVO administered as a single agent or in combination with ipilimumab was evaluated in CHECKMATE-142, a multicenter, non-randomized, multiple parallel-cohort, open-label study. In CHECKMATE-142, 74 patients with mCRC received OPDIVO 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks until disease progression or until intolerable toxicity and 119 patients with mCRC received OPDIVO 3 mg/kg and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 4 doses, then OPDIVO 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks until disease progression or until unacceptable toxicity.  [See  Clinical Studies (14.9)  .]  



 OPDIVO was discontinued in 13% of patients and delayed in 45% of patients for an adverse reaction. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 47% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients were colitis/diarrhea, hepatic events, abdominal pain, acute kidney injury, pyrexia, and dehydration. The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) were fatigue, diarrhea, pyrexia, musculoskeletal pain, abdominal pain, pruritus, nausea, rash, decreased appetite, and vomiting.



 Table 20 summarizes adverse reactions that occurred in greater than 10% of patients receiving OPDIVO with ipilimumab. Table 21 summarizes laboratory tests that worsened from baseline in greater than 10% of patients receiving OPDIVO with ipilimumab. Based on the design of CHECKMATE-142, the data below cannot be used to identify statistically significant differences between the two cohorts summarized below for any adverse reaction.

               Hepatocellular Carcinoma      
   The safety of OPDIVO was evaluated in a 154-patient subgroup of patients with HCC and Child-Pugh A cirrhosis who progressed on or were intolerant to sorafenib enrolled in CHECKMATE-040, a multicenter, open-label trial. Patients were required to have an AST and ALT of no more than five times the upper limit of normal and total bilirubin of less than 3 mg/dL. The median duration of exposure to OPDIVO was 6 months.



 The toxicity profile observed in patients with advanced HCC was generally similar to that observed in patients with other cancers, with the exception of a higher incidence of elevations in transaminases and bilirubin levels. Treatment with OPDIVO resulted in treatment-emergent Grade 3 or 4 AST in 27 (18%) patients, Grade 3 or 4 ALT in 16 (11%) patients, and Grade 3 or 4 bilirubin in 11 (7%) patients. Immune-mediated hepatitis requiring systemic corticosteroids occurred in 8 (5%) patients.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of OPDIVO. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

   6.3 Immunogenicity

  As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity.



 Of 2085 patients who were treated with OPDIVO as a single agent 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks and evaluable for the presence of anti-nivolumab antibodies, 233 patients (11.2%) tested positive for treatment-emergent anti-nivolumab antibodies by an electrochemiluminescent (ECL) assay and 15 patients (0.7%) had neutralizing antibodies against nivolumab. There was no evidence of altered pharmacokinetic profile or increased incidence of infusion reactions with anti-nivolumab antibody development.



 Of the patients who were treated with OPDIVO and ipilimumab and evaluable for the presence of anti-nivolumab antibodies, the incidence of anti-nivolumab antibodies was 23.8% to 26.0% with nivolumab 3 mg/kg followed by ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks and 37.8% with nivolumab 1 mg/kg followed by ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks. The incidence of neutralizing antibodies against nivolumab was 0.5% to 1.9% with nivolumab 3 mg/kg followed by ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks and 4.6% with nivolumab 1 mg/kg followed by ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Of patients evaluable for the presence of anti-ipilimumab antibodies, the incidence of anti-ipilimumab antibodies ranged from 4.1% to 8.4% and neutralizing antibodies against ipilimumab ranged from 0 to 0.3%.



 Overall, there was no evidence of increased incidence of infusion reactions or effects on efficacy with anti-nivolumab antibody development.



 The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of incidence of antibodies to OPDIVO with the incidences of antibodies to other products may be misleading.

Approximately 78% of patients with immune-mediated nephritis and renal dysfunction received high-dose corticosteroids (at least 40 mg prednisone equivalents per day) for a median duration of 17 days (range: 1 day to 6 months). Complete resolution occurred in 63% of patients. One of 16 patients with RCC had recurrence of nephritis or renal dysfunction after re-initiation of OPDIVO with ipilimumab.  



    5.6 Immune-Mediated Skin Adverse Reactions



  OPDIVO can cause immune-mediated rash, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), some cases with fatal outcome. For symptoms or signs of SJS or TEN, withhold OPDIVO and refer the patient for specialized care for assessment and treatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue OPDIVO [see  Dosage and Administration (2.11)  ]  .



 For immune-mediated rash, administer corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalents followed by a corticosteroid taper for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) rash. Withhold OPDIVO for severe (Grade 3) rash and permanently discontinue OPDIVO for life-threatening (Grade 4) rash.



     OPDIVO as a Single Agent  



  In patients receiving OPDIVO as a single agent, immune-mediated rash occurred in 9% (171/1994) of patients; the median time to onset was 2.8 months (range: &lt;1 day to 25.8 months). Immune-mediated rash led to permanent discontinuation of OPDIVO in 0.3% and withholding of OPDIVO in 0.8% of patients. Approximately 16% of patients with rash received high-dose corticosteroids (at least 40 mg prednisone equivalents per day) for a median duration of 12 days (range: 1 days to 8.9 months) and 85% received topical corticosteroids. Complete resolution occurred in 48% of patients. Recurrence of rash occurred in 1.4% of patients who resumed OPDIVO after resolution of rash.



     OPDIVO with Ipilimumab  



  OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg



  Immune-mediated rash occurred in 22.6% (92/407) of patients with melanoma receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Median time to onset was 18 days (range: 1 day to 9.7 months). Immune-mediated rash led to permanent discontinuation or withholding of OPDIVO with ipilimumab in 0.5% and 3.9% of patients, respectively. Approximately 17% of patients with rash received high-dose corticosteroids (at least 40 mg prednisone equivalents per day) for a median duration of 14 days (range: 2 days to 4.7 months). Complete resolution occurred in 47% of patients. Approximately 6% of patients who resumed OPDIVO and ipilimumab after resolution had recurrence of rash.  



  OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with Ipilimumab 1 mg/kg  



  Immune-mediated rash occurred in 16% (90/547) of patients with RCC and 14% (17/119) of patients with CRC who received OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Median time to onset was 1.5 months (range: 1 day to 20.9 months) in RCC and 26 days (range: 5 days to 9.8 months) in CRC.  



  Immune-mediated rash led to permanent discontinuation or withholding of OPDIVO with ipilimumab in 0.5% of patients with RCC or CRC (n=666) and withholding of OPDIVO with ipilimumab in 2.6% of patients. All patients with immune-mediated rash required systemic corticosteroids, including 19% who received high-dose corticosteroids (at least 40 mg prednisone equivalents per day) for a median duration of 22 days (range: 1 day to 23 months). Complete resolution occurred in 66% of patients. Immune-mediated rash recurred in approximately 3% (3/98) of patients who resumed OPDIVO and ipilimumab.  



    5.7 Immune-Mediated Encephalitis



  OPDIVO can cause immune-mediated encephalitis with no clear alternate etiology. Evaluation of patients with neurologic symptoms may include, but not be limited to, consultation with a neurologist, brain MRI, and lumbar puncture.



 Withhold OPDIVO in patients with new-onset moderate to severe neurologic signs or symptoms and evaluate to rule out infectious or other causes of moderate to severe neurologic deterioration. If other etiologies are ruled out, administer corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalents for patients with immune-mediated encephalitis, followed by corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue OPDIVO for immune-mediated encephalitis [see  Dosage and Administration (2.11)  ].  



     OPDIVO as a Single Agent     



  In patients receiving OPDIVO as a single agent, encephalitis occurred in 0.2% (3/1994). Fatal limbic encephalitis occurred in one patient after 7.2 months of exposure despite discontinuation of OPDIVO and administration of corticosteroids. In the other two patients, encephalitis occurred post-allogeneic HSCT [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.10)  ]  .



     OPDIVO with Ipilimumab     



  OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg



  Encephalitis occurred in one patient (0.2%) with melanoma receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks after 1.7 months of exposure.  



  OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with Ipilimumab 1 mg/kg  



  Encephalitis occurred in one patient (0.2%) with RCC after approximately 4 months of exposure and one patient (0.8%) with CRC after 15 days of exposure. The patient with CRC required infliximab and high-dose corticosteroids (at least 40 mg prednisone equivalents per day).  



    5.8 Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions



  OPDIVO can cause other clinically significant and potentially fatal  immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions may occur after discontinuation of OPDIVO therapy. For any suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, permanently discontinue or withhold OPDIVO, administer high-dose corticosteroids, and if appropriate, initiate hormone-replacement therapy. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider restarting OPDIVO after completion of corticosteroid taper based on the severity of the event [see  Dosage and Administration (2.11)  ]  .



  Across clinical trials of OPDIVO administered as a single agent or in combination with ipilimumab, the following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions, some with fatal outcome, occurred in less than 1.0% of patients receiving OPDIVO: myocarditis, rhabdomyolysis, myositis, uveitis, iritis, pancreatitis, facial and abducens nerve paresis, demyelination, polymyalgia rheumatica, autoimmune neuropathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome, hypopituitarism, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, gastritis, duodenitis, sarcoidosis, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), motor dysfunction, vasculitis, aplastic anemia, pericarditis, and myasthenic syndrome.  



  If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, which has been observed in patients receiving OPDIVO or OPDIVO in combination with ipilimumab and may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss.  



    5.9 Infusion Reactions



  OPDIVO can cause severe infusion reactions, which have been reported in less than 1.0% of patients in clinical trials. Discontinue OPDIVO in patients with severe or life-threatening infusion reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion in patients with mild or moderate infusion reactions [see  Dosage and Administration (2.11)  ]  .



     OPDIVO as a Single Agent  



  In patients receiving OPDIVO as a 60-minute intravenous infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 6.4% (127/1994) of patients.



  In a study assessing the pharmacokinetics and safety of a more rapid infusion, in which patients received OPDIVO as a 60-minute intravenous infusion or a 30-minute intravenous infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.2% (8/368) and 2.7% (10/369) of patients, respectively. Additionally, 0.5% (2/368) and 1.4% (5/369) of patients, respectively, experienced adverse reactions within 48 hours of infusion that led to dose delay, permanent discontinuation or withholding of OPDIVO.  



     OPDIVO with Ipilimumab  



  OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg



  Infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.5% (10/407) of patients with melanoma receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks.  



  OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with Ipilimumab 1 mg/kg  



  Infusion-related reactions occurred in 5.1% (28/547) of patients with RCC and 4.2% (5/119) of patients with CRC receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, respectively.  



    5.10 Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation



   Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after being treated with a PD-1 receptor blocking antibody. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause) [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT.  



  Follow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with a PD-1 receptor blocking antibody prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.  



    5.11 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal studies, OPDIVO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of nivolumab to cynomolgus monkeys from the onset of organogenesis through delivery resulted in increased abortion and premature infant death. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with an OPDIVO-containing regimen and for at least 5 months after the last dose of OPDIVO [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1  ,  8.3)  ]  .
