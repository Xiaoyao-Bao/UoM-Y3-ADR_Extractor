   EXCERPT:    *    Recommended dose is 100 mg orally approximately every twelve hours; swallow whole with water and with or without food.  (2.1)   
 *    Advise patients not to break, open, or chew capsules.  (2.1)   
 *    Manage toxicities using treatment interruption, dose reduction, or discontinuation.  (2.2)   
    
   2.1 Recommended Dosage

  The recommended dose of CALQUENCE is 100 mg taken orally approximately every twelve hours until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.



 Advise patients to swallow capsule whole with water. Advise patients not to open, break or chew the capsules. CALQUENCE may be taken with or without food. If a dose of CALQUENCE is missed by more than 3 hours, it should be skipped and the next dose should be taken at its regularly scheduled time. Extra capsules of CALQUENCE should not be taken to make up for a missed dose.



   2.2 Dose Modifications

    Adverse Reactions  

  Recommended dose modifications of CALQUENCE for Grade 3 or greater adverse reactions are provided in Table 1.



 Table 1: Recommended Dose Modifications for Adverse Reactions 
  Event                    Adverse Reaction Occurrence    Dose Modification  (Starting dose = 100 mg twice daily)    
  Grade 3 or greater non-hematologic toxicities,  Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding,  Grade 4 thrombocytopenia or  Grade 4 neutropenia lasting longer than 7 days    First and Second            Interrupt CALQUENCE.  Once toxicity has resolved to Grade 1 or baseline level, CALQUENCE therapy may be resumed at 100 mg twice daily.    
  Third                    Interrupt CALQUENCE.  Once toxicity has resolved to Grade 1 or baseline level, CALQUENCE therapy may be resumed at 100 mg daily.    
  Fourth                   Discontinue CALQUENCE.

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  As clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The safety data described in this section reflect exposure to CALQUENCE (100 mg twice daily) in 124 patients with previously treated MCL in Trial LY-004  [see  Clinical Studies (14)  ]  . The median duration of treatment with CALQUENCE was 16.6 (range 0.1 to 26.6) months. A total of 91 (73.4%) patients were treated with CALQUENCE for &gt;= 6 months and 74 (59.7%) patients were treated for &gt;= 1 year.



 The most common adverse reactions (&gt;= 20%) of any grade were anemia, thrombocytopenia, headache, neutropenia, diarrhea, fatigue, myalgia, and bruising. Grade 1 severity for the non-hematologic, most common events were as follows: headache (25%), diarrhea (16%), fatigue (20%), myalgia (15%), and bruising (19%). The most common Grade &gt;= 3 non-hematological adverse reaction (reported in at least 2% of patients) was diarrhea.



 Dose reductions or discontinuation due to any adverse reaction were reported in 1.6% and 6.5% of patients, respectively.



 Tables 2 and 3 present the frequency category of adverse reactions observed in patients with MCL treated with CALQUENCE.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *     Hemorrhage : Monitor for bleeding and manage appropriately.  (5.1)   
 *     Infections : Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection and treat as needed.  (5.2)   
 *     Cytopenias : Monitor complete blood counts monthly during treatment.  (5.3)   
 *     Second Primary Malignancies : Other malignancies have occurred in patients, including skin cancers and other carcinomas. Advise patients to use sun protection.  (5.4)   
 *     Atrial Fibrillation and Flutter : Monitor for atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter and manage as appropriate.  (5.5)   
    
 

   5.1 Hemorrhage



  Serious hemorrhagic events, including fatal events, have occurred in the combined safety database of 612 patients with hematologic malignancies treated with CALQUENCE monotherapy. Grade 3 or higher bleeding events, including gastrointestinal, intracranial, and epistaxis have been reported in 2% of patients. Overall, bleeding events including bruising and petechiae of any grade occurred in approximately 50% of patients with hematological malignancies.



 The mechanism for the bleeding events is not well understood. CALQUENCE may further increase the risk of hemorrhage in patients receiving antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapies and patients should be monitored for signs of bleeding. Consider the benefit-risk of withholding CALQUENCE for 3-7 days pre- and post-surgery depending upon the type of surgery and the risk of bleeding.



    5.2 Infection



  Serious infections (bacterial, viral or fungal), including fatal events and opportunistic infections have occurred in the combined safety database of 612 patients with hematologic malignancies treated with CALQUENCE monotherapy. Consider prophylaxis in patients who are at increased risk for opportunistic infections.



 Grade 3 or higher infections occurred in 18% of these patients. The most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 infection was pneumonia. Infections due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have occurred. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection and treat as medically appropriate.



    5.3 Cytopenias



  In the combined safety database of 612 patients with hematologic malignancies, patients treated with CALQUENCE monotherapy experienced Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias, including neutropenia (23%), anemia (11%) and thrombocytopenia (8%) based on laboratory measurements. In the CALQUENCE clinical Trial LY-004, patients' complete blood counts were assessed monthly during treatment.



    5.4 Second Primary Malignancies



  Second primary malignancies, including non-skin carcinomas, have occurred in 11% of patients with hematologic malignancies treated with CALQUENCE monotherapy in the combined safety database of 612 patients. The most frequent second primary malignancy was skin cancer, reported in 7% of patients. Advise protection from sun exposure.



    5.5 Atrial Fibrillation and Flutter



  In the combined safety database of 612 patients with hematologic malignancies treated with CALQUENCE monotherapy, atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter of any grade occurred in 3% of patients, and Grade 3 in 1% of patients. Monitor for atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter and manage as appropriate.
