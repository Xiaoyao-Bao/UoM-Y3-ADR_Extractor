  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in the general patient population.



 The safety data reflect exposure to ALIQOPA in 168 adults with follicular lymphoma and other hematologic malignancies treated with ALIQOPA 60 mg or 0.8 mg/kg equivalent in clinical trials. The median duration of treatment was 22 weeks (range 1 to 206 weeks).



 Serious adverse reactions were reported in 44 (26%) patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions that occurred were pneumonia (8%), pneumonitis (5%) and hyperglycemia (5%). The most common adverse reactions (&gt;=20%) were hyperglycemia, diarrhea, decreased general strength and energy, hypertension, leukopenia, neutropenia, nausea, lower respiratory tract infections, and thrombocytopenia.



 Adverse reactions resulted in dose reduction in 36 (21%) and discontinuation in 27 (16%) patients. The most common reasons for dose reduction were hyperglycemia (7%), neutropenia (5%), and hypertension (5%). The most common reasons for drug discontinuation were pneumonitis (2%) and hyperglycemia (2%).



 Table 2 provides the adverse reactions occurring in at least 10% of patients receiving ALIQOPA monotherapy, and Table 3 provides the treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities in &gt;=20% of patients and &gt;=4% of Grade &gt;=3 treated with ALIQOPA.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *    Infections: Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection. Withhold treatment for Grade 3 and higher infections until resolution (  5.1  ). 
 *    Hyperglycemia: Start each infusion once optimal blood glucose control is achieved. Withhold treatment, reduce dose or discontinue treatment depending on the severity and persistence of hyperglycemia (  5.2  ). 
 *    Hypertension: Withhold treatment in patients until both the systolic blood pressure (BP) is less than 150 mmHg and the diastolic BP is less than 90 mmHg. Consider reducing dose if anti-hypertensive treatment is required. Discontinue in patients with BP that is uncontrolled or with life-threatening consequences (  5.3  ). 
 *    Non-infectious pneumonitis (NIP): Treat NIP and reduce dose. Discontinue treatment if Grade 2 NIP recurs or in patients experiencing Grade 3 or higher NIP (  5.4  ). 
 *    Neutropenia: Monitor blood counts at least weekly while under treatment. Withhold treatment until ANC &gt;=0.5 x 10  3  cells/mm  3  (  5.5  ). 
 *    Severe Cutaneous Reactions: Withhold treatment, reduce dose, or discontinue treatment depending on the severity and persistence of severe cutaneous reactions (  5.6  ). 
 *    Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: ALIQOPA can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception (  5.7  ,  8.1  ,  8.3  ). 
    
 

   5.1 Infections



  Serious, including fatal, infections occurred in 19% of 317 patients treated with ALIQOPA monotherapy. The most common serious infection was pneumonia [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection and withhold ALIQOPA for Grade 3 and higher infection [see Dosage and Administration (  2.5  )]  .



 Serious pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) infection occurred in 0.6% of 317 patients treated with ALIQOPA monotherapy [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )].  Before initiating treatment with ALIQOPA, consider PJP prophylaxis for populations at risk. Withhold ALIQOPA in patients with suspected PJP infection of any grade. If confirmed, treat infection until resolution, then resume ALIQOPA at previous dose with concomitant PJP prophylaxis [see Dosage and Administration (  2.5  )]  .



    5.2 Hyperglycemia



  Grade 3 or 4 hyperglycemia (blood glucose 250 mg/dL or greater) occurred in 41% of 317 patients treated with ALIQOPA monotherapy [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . Serious hyperglycemic events occurred in 2.8% of patients. Treatment with ALIQOPA may result in infusion-related hyperglycemia. Blood glucose levels typically peaked 5 to 8 hours post-infusion and subsequently declined to baseline levels for a majority of patients; blood glucose levels remained elevated in 17.7% of patients one day after ALIQOPA infusion. Of 155 patients with baseline HbA1c &lt;5.7%, 16 (10%) patients had HbA1c &gt;6.5% at the end of treatment.



 Of the twenty patients with diabetes mellitus treated in CHRONOS-1, seven developed Grade 4 hyperglycemia and two discontinued treatment. Patients with diabetes mellitus should only be treated with ALIQOPA following adequate glucose control and should be monitored closely.



 Achieve optimal blood glucose control before starting each ALIQOPA infusion. Withhold, reduce dose, or discontinue ALIQOPA depending on the severity and persistence of hyperglycemia [see Dosage and Administration (  2.5  )]  .



    5.3 Hypertension



  Grade 3 hypertension (systolic 160 mmHg or greater or diastolic 100 mmHg or greater) occurred in 26% of 317 patients treated with ALIQOPA monotherapy [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . Serious hypertensive events occurred in 0.9% of 317 patients. Treatment with ALIQOPA may result in infusion-related hypertension. The mean change of systolic and diastolic BP from baseline to 2 hours post-infusion on Cycle 1 Day 1 was 16.8 mmHg and 7.8 mmHg, respectively. The mean BP started decreasing approximately 2 hours post-infusion; BP remained elevated for 6 to 8 hours after the start of the ALIQOPA infusion. Optimal BP control should be achieved before starting each ALIQOPA infusion. Monitor BP pre- and post-infusion. Withhold, reduce dose, or discontinue ALIQOPA depending on the severity and persistence of hypertension [see Dosage and Administration (  2.5  )]  .



    5.4 Non-Infectious Pneumonitis



  Non-infectious pneumonitis occurred in 5% of 317 patients treated with ALIQOPA monotherapy [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )].  Withhold ALIQOPA and conduct a diagnostic examination of a patient who is experiencing pulmonary symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, hypoxia, or interstitial infiltrates on radiologic exam. Patients with pneumonitis thought to be caused by ALIQOPA have been managed by withholding ALIQOPA and administration of systemic corticosteroids. Withhold, reduce dose, or discontinue ALIQOPA depending on the severity and persistence of non-infectious pneumonitis [see Dosage and Administration (  2.5  )]  .



    5.5 Neutropenia



  Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurred in 24% of 317 patients treated with ALIQOPA monotherapy. Serious neutropenic events occurred in 1.3% [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . Monitor blood counts at least weekly during treatment with ALIQOPA. Withhold, reduce dose, or discontinue ALIQOPA depending on the severity and persistence of neutropenia [see Dosage and Administration (  2.5  )]  .



    5.6 Severe Cutaneous Reactions



  Grade 3 and 4 cutaneous reactions occurred in 2.8% and 0.6% of 317 patients treated with ALIQOPA monotherapy, respectively [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )].  Serious cutaneous reaction events were reported in 0.9%. The reported events included dermatitis exfoliative, exfoliative rash, pruritus, and rash (including maculo-papular rash). Withhold, reduce dose, or discontinue ALIQOPA depending on the severity and persistence of severe cutaneous reactions [see Dosage and Administration (  2.5  )]  .



    5.7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action, ALIQOPA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of copanlisib to pregnant rats during organogenesis caused embryo-fetal death and fetal abnormalities in rats at maternal doses as low as 0.75 mg/kg/day (4.5 mg/m  2  /day body surface area) corresponding to approximately 12% the recommended dose for patients. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential and males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least one month after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  ,  8.3  ) and Clinical Pharmacology (  12.1  )]  .
