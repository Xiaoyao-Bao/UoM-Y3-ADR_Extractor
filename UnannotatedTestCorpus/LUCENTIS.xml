  The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label:

 *  Endophthalmitis and Retinal Detachments [ see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)   ] 
 *  Increases in Intraocular Pressure [ see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)   ] 
 *  Thromboembolic Events [ see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)   ] 
 *  Fatal Events in patients with DME and DR at baseline [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.4)  ]  
   *  The most common adverse reactions (reported more frequently in LUCENTIS-treated subjects than control subjects) are conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain, vitreous floaters, and increased IOP (  6.2  ).

  6.1 Injection Procedure

  Serious adverse reactions related to the injection procedure have occurred in &lt; 0.1% of intravitreal injections, including endophthalmitis [  see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)    ], rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, and iatrogenic traumatic cataract.

   6.2 Clinical Studies Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in one clinical trial of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of the same or another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

 The data below reflect exposure to 0.5 mg LUCENTIS in 440 patients with neovascular AMD in Studies AMD-1, AMD-2, and AMD-3; in 259 patients with macular edema following RVO. The data also reflect exposure to 0.3 mg LUCENTIS in 250 patients with DME and DR at baseline [  see  Clinical Studies (14)    ].

 Safety data observed in 224 patients with mCNV, as well as Studies AMD-4 and D-3, were consistent with these results. On average, the rates and types of adverse reactions in patients were not significantly affected by dosing regimen.

     Ocular Reactions  

   Table 1  shows frequently reported ocular adverse reactions in LUCENTIS-treated patients compared with the control group.

                   Non-Ocular Reactions  
 

 Non-ocular adverse reactions with an incidence of &gt;= 5% in patients receiving LUCENTIS for DR, DME, AMD, and/or RVO and which occurred at a &gt;= 1% higher frequency in patients treated with LUCENTIS compared to control are shown in  Table 2  . Though less common, wound healing complications were also observed in some studies.

                 6.3 Immunogenicity
   As with all therapeutic proteins, there is the potential for an immune response in patients treated with LUCENTIS. The immunogenicity data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were considered positive for antibodies to LUCENTIS in immunoassays and are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assays.

 The pre-treatment incidence of immunoreactivity to LUCENTIS was 0%-5% across treatment groups. After monthly dosing with LUCENTIS for 6 to 24 months, antibodies to LUCENTIS were detected in approximately 1%-9% of patients.

 The clinical significance of immunoreactivity to LUCENTIS is unclear at this time. Among neovascular AMD patients with the highest levels of immunoreactivity, some were noted to have iritis or vitritis. Intraocular inflammation was not observed in patients with DME and DR at baseline, or RVO patients with the highest levels of immunoreactivity.

   6.4 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reaction has been identified during post-approval use of LUCENTIS. Because this reaction was reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

 *  Ocular: Tear of retinal pigment epithelium among patients with neovascular AMD 

</Section>
    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">   5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

   EXCERPT:    *  Endophthalmitis and retinal detachments may occur following intravitreal injections. Patients should be monitored following the injection (  5.1  ). 
 *  Increases in intraocular pressure (IOP) have been noted both pre- and post-intravitreal injection (  5.2  ). 
 *  There is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors (  5.3  ). 
 *  Fatal events occurred more frequently in patients with DME and DR at baseline, who were treated monthly with LUCENTIS compared with control (  5.4  ). 
    
 

   5.1 Endophthalmitis and Retinal Detachments

  Intravitreal injections, including those with LUCENTIS, have been associated with endophthalmitis and retinal detachments. Proper aseptic injection technique should always be used when administering LUCENTIS. In addition, patients should be monitored following the injection to permit early treatment should an infection occur [ see  Dosage and Administration (2.6  ,  2.7)  and  Patient Counseling Information (17)    ].

    5.2 Increases in Intraocular Pressure

  Increases in intraocular pressure have been noted both pre-injection and post-injection (at 60 minutes) while being treated with LUCENTIS. Monitor intraocular pressure prior to and following intravitreal injection with LUCENTIS and manage appropriately [ see  Dosage and Administration (2.7)    ].

    5.3 Thromboembolic Events

  Although there was a low rate of arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) observed in the LUCENTIS clinical trials, there is a potential risk of ATEs following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors. Arterial thromboembolic events are defined as nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or vascular death (including deaths of unknown cause).

    Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration  

 The ATE rate in the three controlled neovascular AMD studies (AMD-1, AMD-2, AMD-3) during the first year was 1.9% (17 of 874) in the combined group of patients treated with 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg LUCENTIS compared with 1.1% (5 of 441) in patients from the control arms [ see  Clinical Studies (14.1)    ]. In the second year of Studies AMD-1 and AMD-2, the ATE rate was 2.6% (19 of 721) in the combined group of LUCENTIS-treated patients compared with 2.9% (10 of 344) in patients from the control arms. In Study AMD-4, the ATE rates observed in the 0.5 mg arms during the first and second year were similar to rates observed in Studies AMD-1, AMD-2, and AMD-3.

 In a pooled analysis of 2-year controlled studies [AMD-1, AMD-2, and a study of LUCENTIS used adjunctively with verteporfin photodynamic therapy (PDT)], the stroke rate (including both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke) was 2.7% (13 of 484) in patients treated with 0.5 mg LUCENTIS compared to 1.1% (5 of 435) in patients in the control arms [odds ratio 2.2 (95% confidence interval (0.8-7.1)].

    Macular Edema Following Retinal Vein Occlusion  

 The ATE rate in the two controlled RVO studies during the first 6 months was 0.8% in both the LUCENTIS and control arms of the studies (4 of 525 in the combined group of patients treated with 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg LUCENTIS and 2 of 260 in the control arms) [ see  Clinical Studies (14.2)    ]. The stroke rate was 0.2% (1 of 525) in the combined group of LUCENTIS-treated patients compared to 0.4% (1 of 260) in the control arms.

    Diabetic Macular Edema and Diabetic Retinopathy  

 Safety data are derived from studies D-1 and D-2. All enrolled patients had DME and DR at baseline [ see  Clinical Studies (14.3  ,  14.4)    ].

 In a pooled analysis of Studies D-1 and D-2 [ see  Clinical Studies (14.3)    ], the ATE rate at 2 years was 7.2% (18 of 250) with 0.5 mg LUCENTIS, 5.6% (14 of 250) with 0.3 mg LUCENTIS, and 5.2% (13 of 250) with control. The stroke rate at 2 years was 3.2% (8 of 250) with 0.5 mg LUCENTIS, 1.2% (3 of 250) with 0.3 mg LUCENTIS, and 1.6% (4 of 250) with control. At 3 years, the ATE rate was 10.4% (26 of 249) with 0.5 mg LUCENTIS and 10.8% (27 of 250) with 0.3 mg LUCENTIS; the stroke rate was 4.8% (12 of 249) with 0.5 mg LUCENTIS and 2.0% (5 of 250) with 0.3 mg LUCENTIS.

    5.4 Fatal Events in Patients with Diabetic Macular Edema and Diabetic Retinopathy at Baseline

   Diabetic Macular Edema and Diabetic Retinopathy  

 Safety data are derived from studies D-1 and D-2. All enrolled patients had DME and DR at baseline [ see  Clinical Studies (14.3  ,  14.4)    ].

 A pooled analysis of Studies D-1 and D-2 [ see  Clinical Studies (14.3)    ], showed that fatalities in the first 2 years occurred in 4.4% (11 of 250) of patients treated with 0.5 mg LUCENTIS, in 2.8% (7 of 250) of patients treated with 0.3 mg LUCENTIS, and in 1.2% (3 of 250) of control patients. Over 3 years, fatalities occurred in 6.4% (16 of 249) of patients treated with 0.5 mg LUCENTIS and in 4.4% (11 of 250) of patients treated with 0.3 mg LUCENTIS. Although the rate of fatal events was low and included causes of death typical of patients with advanced diabetic complications, a potential relationship between these events and intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors cannot be excluded.
