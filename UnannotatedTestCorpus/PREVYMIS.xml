  EXCERPT:   Most common adverse events (occurring in at least 10% of subjects in the PREVYMIS group and at a frequency at least 2% greater than placebo) are nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, peripheral edema, cough, headache, fatigue, and abdominal pain. (  6.1  )



   To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck &amp; Co., Inc., at 1-877-888-4231 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.  



 

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     Adult CMV-seropositive Recipients [R+] of an Allogeneic HSCT  



 The safety of PREVYMIS was evaluated in one Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (P001) in which 565 subjects were randomized and treated with PREVYMIS (N=373) or placebo (N=192) through Week 14 post-transplant. Adverse events were those reported while subjects were on study medication or within two weeks of study medication completion/discontinuation. The mean time for reporting adverse events and laboratory abnormalities was approximately 22% longer in the PREVYMIS arm compared to the placebo arm.



     Cardiac Adverse Events:  



 The cardiac adverse event rate (regardless of investigator-assessed causality) was higher in subjects receiving PREVYMIS (13%) compared to subjects receiving placebo (6%). The most common cardiac adverse events were tachycardia (reported in 4% of PREVYMIS subjects and in 2% of placebo subjects) and atrial fibrillation (reported in 3% of PREVYMIS subjects and in 1% of placebo subjects). Among those subjects who experienced one or more cardiac adverse events, 85% of PREVYMIS and 92% of placebo subjects had events reported as mild or moderate in severity.



     Common Adverse Events  



 The rate of adverse events occurring in at least 10% of subjects in the PREVYMIS group and at a frequency at least 2% greater than placebo are outlined in Table 1.

 cough                                              14%                                10%                  
 headache                                           14%                                9%                   
 fatigue                                            13%                                11%                  
 abdominal pain                                     12%                                9%                   
         Overall, similar proportions of subjects in each group discontinued study medication due to an adverse event (13% of PREVYMIS subjects vs. 12% of placebo subjects). The most frequently reported adverse event that led to study drug discontinuation was nausea, occurring in 2% of PREVYMIS subjects and 1% of placebo subjects. Hypersensitivity reaction, with associated moderate dyspnea, occurred in one subject following the first infusion of IV PREVYMIS after switching from oral PREVYMIS, leading to treatment discontinuation.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Risk of Adverse Reactions or Reduced Therapeutic Effect Due to Drug Interactions: The concomitant use of PREVYMIS with certain drugs may result in potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to adverse reactions (PREVYMIS or concomitant drugs) or reduced therapeutic effect of PREVYMIS or the concomitant drug. Consult the full prescribing information for contraindications and dosage recommendations for concomitant drugs. (  4  ,  5.1  ,  7.1  ,  7.2  ,  7.3  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Risk of Adverse Reactions or Reduced Therapeutic Effect Due to Drug Interactions



  The concomitant use of PREVYMIS and certain drugs may result in potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to adverse reactions (PREVYMIS or concomitant drugs) or reduced therapeutic effect of PREVYMIS or the concomitant drug [see  Contraindications (4)  and  Drug Interactions (7.1  ,  7.2  ,  7.3)  ].  



 See  Table 3  for steps to prevent or manage these possible or known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during PREVYMIS therapy; review concomitant medications during PREVYMIS therapy; and monitor for adverse reactions associated with PREVYMIS and concomitant medications.
