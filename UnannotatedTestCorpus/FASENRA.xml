  The following adverse reactions are described in greater detail in other sections:



 *    Hypersensitivity Reactions [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  
      EXCERPT:   Most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 5%) include headache and pharyngitis. (  6.1  )

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 Across Trials 1, 2, and 3, 1,808 patients received at least 1 dose of FASENRA  [see  Clinical Studies (14)  ]  . The data described below reflect exposure to FASENRA in 1,663 patients, including 1,556 exposed for at least 24 weeks and 1,387 exposed for at least 48 weeks. The safety exposure for FASENRA is derived from two phase 3 placebo-controlled studies (Trials 1 and 2) from 48 weeks duration [FASENRA every 4 weeks (n = 841), FASENRA every 4 weeks for 3 doses, then every 8 weeks (n = 822), and placebo (n = 847)]. While a dosing regimen of FASENRA every 4 weeks was included in clinical trials, FASENRA administered every 4 weeks for 3 doses, then every 8 weeks thereafter is the recommended dose  [see  Dosage and Administration (2.1)  ]  . The population studied was 12 to 75 years of age, of which 64% were female and 79% were white.



 Adverse reactions that occurred at greater than or equal to 3% incidence are shown in  Table 1  .

  PharyngitisPharyngitis was defined by the following terms: 'Pharyngitis', 'Pharyngitis bacterial', 'Viral pharyngitis', 'Pharyngitis streptococcal'.    5                                  3                                  
  Hypersensitivity reactionsHypersensitivity Reactions were defined by the following terms: 'Urticaria', 'Urticaria papular', and 'Rash' [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].    3                                  3                                  
           28-Week Trial  
 

 Adverse reactions from Trial 3 with 28 weeks of treatment with FASENRA (n = 73) or placebo (n = 75) in which the incidence was more common in FASENRA than placebo include headache (8.2% compared to 5.3%, respectively) and pyrexia (2.7% compared to 1.3%, respectively)  [see  Clinical Studies (14)  ]  . The frequencies for the remaining adverse reactions with FASENRA were similar to placebo.



   Injection site reactions  



 In Trials 1 and 2, injection site reactions (e.g., pain, erythema, pruritus, papule) occurred at a rate of 2.2% in patients treated with FASENRA compared with 1.9% in patients treated with placebo.



   6.2 Immunogenicity

  As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to benralizumab in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading.



 Overall, treatment-emergent anti-drug antibody response developed in 13% of patients treated with FASENRA at the recommended dosing regimen during the 48 to 56 week treatment period. A total of 12% of patients treated with FASENRA developed neutralizing antibodies. Anti-benralizumab antibodies were associated with increased clearance of benralizumab and increased blood eosinophil levels in patients with high anti-drug antibody titers compared to antibody negative patients. No evidence of an association of anti-drug antibodies with efficacy or safety was observed.



 The data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were positive for antibodies to benralizumab in specific assays.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *    Hypersensitivity reactions: hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria, rash) have occurred after administration of FASENRA. Discontinue in the event of a hypersensitivity reaction. (  5.1  ) 
 *    Reduction in Corticosteroid Dosage: Do not discontinue systemic or inhaled corticosteroids abruptly upon initiation of therapy with FASENRA. Decrease corticosteroids gradually, if appropriate. (  5.3  ) 
 *    Parasitic (Helminth) Infection: Treat patients with pre-existing helminth infections before therapy with FASENRA. If patients become infected while receiving FASENRA and do not respond to anti-helminth treatment, discontinue FASENRA until the parasitic infection resolves. (  5.4  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions



  Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria, rash) have occurred following administration of FASENRA. These reactions generally occur within hours of administration, but in some instances have a delayed onset (i.e., days). In the event of a hypersensitivity reaction, FASENRA should be discontinued [see  Contraindications (4)  ]  .



    5.2 Acute Asthma Symptoms or Deteriorating Disease



  FASENRA should not be used to treat acute asthma symptoms or acute exacerbations. Do not use FASENRA to treat acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus. Patients should seek medical advice if their asthma remains uncontrolled or worsens after initiation of treatment with FASENRA.



    5.3 Reduction of Corticosteroid Dosage



  Do not discontinue systemic or inhaled corticosteroids abruptly upon initiation of therapy with FASENRA. Reductions in corticosteroid dose, if appropriate, should be gradual and performed under the direct supervision of a physician. Reduction in corticosteroid dose may be associated with systemic withdrawal symptoms and/or unmask conditions previously suppressed by systemic corticosteroid therapy.



    5.4 Parasitic (Helminth) Infection



  Eosinophils may be involved in the immunological response to some helminth infections. Patients with known helminth infections were excluded from participation in clinical trials. It is unknown if FASENRA will influence a patient's response against helminth infections.



 Treat patients with pre-existing helminth infections before initiating therapy with FASENRA. If patients become infected while receiving treatment with FASENRA and do not respond to anti-helminth treatment, discontinue treatment with FASENRA until infection resolves.
