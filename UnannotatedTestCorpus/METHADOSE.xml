  The major hazards of methadone are respiratory depression and, to a lesser degree, systemic hypotension. Respiratory arrest, shock, cardiac arrest, and death have occurred.



 The most frequently observed adverse reactions include lightheadedness, dizziness, sedation, nausea, vomiting, and sweating. These effects seem to be more prominent in ambulatory patients. In such individuals, lower doses are advisable.



 Other adverse reactions include the following: (listed alphabetically under each subsection)



   Body as a Whole    -  asthenia (weakness), edema, headache



   Cardiovascular  (  see      WARNINGS, Cardiac Conduction Effects    )  -  arrhythmias, bigeminal rhythms, bradycardia, cardiomyopathy, ECG abnormalities, extrasystoles, flushing, heart failure, hypotension, palpitations, phlebitis, QT interval prolongation, syncope, T-wave inversion, tachycardia, torsade de pointes, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia



   Digestive    -  abdominal pain, anorexia, biliary tract spasm, constipation, dry mouth, glossitis



   Hematologic and Lymphatic    -  reversible thrombocytopenia has been described in opioid addicts with chronic hepatitis



   Metabolic and Nutritional    -  hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, weight gain



   Nervous    -  agitation, confusion, disorientation, dysphoria, euphoria, insomnia, seizures



   Respiratory    -  pulmonary edema, respiratory depression (  see      WARNINGS, Respiratory        Depression    )



   Skin and Appendages    -  pruritus, urticaria, other skin rashes, and rarely, hemorrhagic urticaria

    BOXED WARNING: 

  

    WARNING: LIFE-THREATENING RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION, LIFE-THREATENING QT PROLONGATION, ACCIDENTAL INGESTION, ABUSE POTENTIAL INTERACTIONS WITH DRUGS AFFECTING CYTOCHROME P450 ISOENZYMES and TREATMENT FOR OPIOID ADDICTION   



     Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression  Respiratory depression, including fatal cases, have been reported during initiation and conversion of patients to methadone, and even when the drug has been used as recommended and not misused or abused (  see     WARNINGS  ). Proper dosing and titration are essential and METHADOSE should only be prescribed by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable in the use of methadone for detoxification and maintenance treatment of opioid addiction. Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of METHADOSE or following a dose increase. The peak respiratory depressant effect of methadone occurs later, and persists longer than the peak pharmacologic effect, especially during the initial dosing period (  see     WARNINGS  ).  



     Risks From Concomitant Use With Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants    



   Concomitant use with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, is a risk factor for respiratory depression and death (  see     WARNINGS     and     PRECAUTIONS  ).  



 *  Reserve concomitant prescribing of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants in patients in methadone treatment to those for whom alternatives to benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants are inadequate. 
 *  Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If the patient is visibly sedated, evaluate the cause of sedation and consider delaying or omitting daily methadone dosing. 
        Life-Threatening QT Prolongation  QT interval prolongation and serious arrhythmia (torsades de pointes) have occurred during treatment with methadone (  see     WARNINGS  ). Most cases involve patients being treated for pain with large, multiple daily doses of methadone, although cases have been reported in patients receiving doses commonly used for maintenance treatment of opioid addiction. Closely monitor patients with risk factors for development of prolonged QT interval, a history of cardiac conduction abnormalities, and those taking medications affecting cardiac conduction for changes in cardiac rhythm during initiation and titration of METHADOSE (  see     WARNINGS  ).  
 

     Accidental Ingestion  Accidental ingestion of METHADOSE, especially by children, can result in fatal overdose of methadone (  see     WARNINGS  ).  



     Misuse, Abuse, and Diversion of Opioids  METHADOSE contains methadone, an opioid agonist and Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit (  see     WARNINGS  ).   



     Interactions with Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes  The concomitant use of METHADOSE with all cytochrome P450 3A4, 2B6, 2C19, 2C9 or 2D6 inhibitors may result in an increase in methadone plasma concentrations, which could cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. In addition, discontinuation of concomitantly used cytochrome P450 3A4 2B6, 2C19, or 2C9 inducers may also result in an increase in methadone plasma concentration. Follow patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation, and consider dosage reduction with any changes of concomitant medications that can result in an increase in methadone levels (  see     WARNINGS     and     PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions  ).  



     Conditions for Distribution and Use of Methadone Products for the Treatment of Opioid Addiction  For detoxification and maintenance of opioid dependence, methadone should be administered in accordance with the treatment standards cited in 42 CFR Section 8, including limitations on unsupervised administration (  see     DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  ).  
</Section>
    <Section id="S3" name="precautions">    PRECAUTIONS



   Information for Patients  



  Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression  



 Discuss the risk of respiratory depression with patients, explaining that the risk is greatest when starting METHADOSE or when the dose is increased ( see     WARNINGS    ). Advise patients how to recognize respiratory depression and to seek medical attention if they are experiencing breathing difficulties.



  Interactions with Benzodiazepines and Other CNS Depressants  



 Inform patients and caregivers that potentially fatal additive effects may occur if METHADOSE is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol. Counsel patients that such medications should not be used concomitantly unless supervised by a healthcare provider ( see      WARNINGS      and      PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions    ).



  Symptoms of Arrhythmia  



 Instruct patients to seek medical attention immediately if they experience symptoms suggestive of an arrhythmia (such as palpitations, near syncope, or syncope) when taking METHADOSE ( see     WARNINGS    ).



  Accidental Ingestion  



 Inform patients that accidental ingestion, especially by children, may result in respiratory depression or death ( see     WARNINGS    ). Instruct patients to take steps to store METHADOSE securely. Advise patients to dispose of unused METHADOSE by flushing down the toilet.



  Abuse Potential  



 Inform patients that METHADOSE contain methadone, a Schedule II controlled substance that is subject to abuse ( see     WARNINGS    ). Instruct patients not to share METHADOSE with others and to take steps to protect METHADOSE from theft or misuse.



  Important Administration Instructions  (  see       DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION    )



 Instruct patients how to properly take METHADOSE, including the following:



 *  METHADOSE is for oral administration only. The preparation must not be injected . 
 *  Inform patients that METHADOSE should be taken only as directed to reduce the risk of life-threatening adverse reactions (e.g., respiratory depression), and the dose should not be adjusted without consulting a physician or other healthcare professional. 
 *  Reassure patients initiating treatment with METHADOSE for opioid dependence that the dose of methadone will "hold" for longer periods of time as treatment progresses. 
 *  Apprise patients seeking to discontinue treatment with methadone for opioid dependence of the high risk of relapse to illicit drug use associated with discontinuation of METHADOSE maintenance treatment. 
 *  Advise patients not to discontinue METHADOSE without first discussing the need for a tapering regimen with the prescriber.  
     Serotonin Syndrome  
 

 Inform patients that METHADOSE could cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition resulting from concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs. Warn patients of the symptoms of serotonin syndrome and to seek medical attention right away if symptoms develop. Instruct patients to inform their physicians if they are taking, or plan to take serotonergic medications ( see      WARNINGS      and     PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions    ).



  MAOI Interaction  



 Inform patients to avoid taking METHADOSE while using any drugs that inhibit monoamine oxidase. Patients should not start MAOIs while taking METHADOSE ( see      WARNINGS      and     PRECAUTIONS,       Drug Interactions    ).



  Adrenal Insufficiency  



 Inform patients that METHADOSE could cause adrenal insufficiency, a potentially life-threatening condition. Adrenal insufficiency may present with non-specific symptoms and signs such as nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. Advise patients to seek medical attention if they experience a constellation of these symptoms ( see     WARNINGS    ).



  Anaphylaxis  



 Inform patients that anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in METHADOSE. Advise patients how to recognize such a reaction and when to seek medical attention ( see     ADVERSE REACTIONS    ).



  Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal  



 Advise women that if they are pregnant while being treated with METHADOSE, the baby may have signs of withdrawal at birth and that withdrawal is treatable ( see     WARNINGS    ).



  Lactation  



 Instruct nursing mothers using METHADOSE to watch for signs of methadone toxicity in their infants, which include increased sleepiness (more than usual), difficulty breastfeeding, breathing difficulties, or limpness. Instruct nursing mothers to talk to their baby's healthcare provider immediately if they notice these signs. If they cannot reach the healthcare provider right away, instruct them to take the baby to the emergency room or call 911 (or local emergency services) ( see     PRECAUTIONS,       Pregnancy    ).



  Constipation  



 Advise patients of the potential for severe constipation, including management instructions and when to seek medical attention ( see     CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY     and     ADVERSE REACTIONS    ).



  Drug Interactions  




  Benzodiazepines and Other Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants    
  Clinical Impact:    Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, increases the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death.    
  Intervention:    Cessation of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants is preferred in most cases of concomitant use. In some cases, monitoring in a higher level of care for taper may be appropriate. In others, gradually tapering a patient off of a prescribed benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant or decreasing to the lowest effective dose may be appropriate.  Before co-prescribing benzodiazepines for anxiety or insomnia, ensure that patients are appropriately diagnosed and consider alternative medications and non-pharmacologic treatments (see WARNINGS).    
  Examples:        Alcohol, benzodiazepines, and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids.    
  Inhibitors of CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, or CYP2D6    
  Clinical Impact:    Methadone undergoes hepatic N-demethylation by several cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms, including CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. The concomitant use of methadone and CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, or CYP2D6 inhibitors can increase the plasma concentration of methadone, resulting in increased or prolonged opioid effects, and may result in a fatal overdose, particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of methadone is achieved. These effects may be more pronounced with concomitant use of drugs that inhibit more than one of the CYP enzymes listed above.  After stopping a CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, or CYP2D6 inhibitor, as the effects of the inhibitor decline, the methadone plasma concentration can decrease, resulting in decreased opioid efficacy or withdrawal symptoms in patients physically dependent on methadone.    
  Intervention:    If concomitant use is necessary, consider dosage reduction of methadone until stable drug effects are achieved. Monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals.  If a CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, or CYP2D6 inhibitor is discontinued, follow patients for signs of opioid withdrawal and consider increasing the methadone dosage until stable drug effects are achieved.    
  Examples:        Macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), fluconazole, fluvoxamine, some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (e.g., sertraline, fluvoxamine)    
  Inducers of CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, or CYP2C9    
  Clinical Impact:    The concomitant use of methadone and CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, or CYP2C9 inducers can decrease the plasma concentration of methadone, resulting in decreased efficacy or onset of withdrawal symptoms in patients physically dependent on methadone. These effects could be more pronounced with concomitant use of drugs that can induce multiple CYP enzymes.  After stopping a CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, or CYP2C9 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the methadone plasma concentration can increase, which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic effects and adverse reactions, and may cause serious respiratory depression, sedation, or death.    
  Intervention:    If concomitant use is necessary, consider increasing the methadone dosage until stable drug effects are achieved. Monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal. If a CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, or CYP2C9 inducer is discontinued, consider methadone dosage reduction and monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation.    
  Examples:        Rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John's Wort, Phenobarbital    
  Potentially Arrhythmogenic Agents    
  Clinical Impact:    Pharmacodynamic interactions may occur with concomitant use of methadone and potentially arrhythmogenic agents or drugs capable of inducing electrolyte disturbances (hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia).    
  Intervention:    Monitor patients closely for cardiac conduction changes.    
  Examples:        Drugs known to have potential to prolong QT interval: Class I and III antiarrhythmics, some neuroleptics and tricyclic antidepressants, and calcium channel blockers. Drugs capable of inducing electrolyte disturbances: Diuretics, laxatives, and, in rare cases, mineralocortocoid hormones.    
  Serotonergic Drugs    
  Clinical Impact:    The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome (see WARNINGS).    
  Intervention:    If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue METHADOSE if serotonin syndrome is suspected.    
  Examples:        Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue).    
  Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)    
  Clinical Impact:    MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma) (see WARNINGS).    
  Intervention:    The use of METHADOSE is not recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment.    
  Examples:        phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid    
  Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics    
  Clinical Impact:    Patients maintained on methadone may experience withdrawal symptoms when given opioid antagonists, mixed agonist/antagonists, and partial agonists.    
  Intervention:    Avoid concomitant use.    
  Examples:        butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, buprenorphine    
  Muscle Relaxants    
  Clinical Impact:    Methadone may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression.    
  Intervention:    Monitor patients for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected and decrease the dosage of METHADOSE and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary.    
  Diuretics        
  Clinical Impact:    Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone.    
  Intervention:    Monitor patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed.    
  Anticholinergic Drugs    
  Clinical Impact:    The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus.    
  Intervention:    Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when METHADOSE is used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs.    
            
 

  Paradoxical Effects of Antiretroviral Agents on Methadone  



 Concurrent use of certain protease inhibitors with CYP3A4 inhibitory activity, alone and in combination, such as abacavir, amprenavir, darunavir+ritonavir, efavirenz, nelfinavir, nevirapine, ritonavir, telaprevir, lopinavir+ritonavir, saquinavir+ritonavir, and tipranvir+ritonavir, has resulted in increased clearance or decreased plasma levels of methadone. This may result in reduced efficacy of METHADOSE and could precipitate a withdrawal syndrome. Monitor patients receiving METHADOSE and  any of these anti-retroviral therapies closely for evidence of withdrawal effects and adjust the METHADOSE dose accordingly.



  Effects of Methadone on Antiretroviral Agents  



  Didanosine and Stavudine   -  Experimental evidence demonstrated that methadone decreased the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) and peak levels for didanosine and stavudine, with a more significant decrease for didanosine. Methadone disposition was not substantially altered.



  Zidovudine   -  Experimental evidence demonstrated that methadone increased the AUC of zidovudine which could result in toxic effects.



  Desipramine   -  Plasma levels of desipramine have increased with concurrent methadone administration.



  Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  



  Carcinogenesis -  The results of carcinogenicity assessment in B6C2F1 mice and Fischer 344 rats following dietary administration of two doses of methadone HCl have been published. Mice consumed 15 mg/kg/day or 60 mg/kg/day methadone for two years. These doses were approximately 0.6 and 2.5 times a human daily oral dose of 120 mg/day on a body surface area basis (HDD). There was a significant increase in pituitary adenomas in female mice treated with 15 mg/kg/day but not with 60 mg/kg/day. Under the conditions of the assay, there was no clear evidence for a treatment-related increase in the incidence of neoplasms in male rats. Due to decreased food consumption in males at the high dose, male rats consumed 16 mg/kg/day and 28 mg/kg/day of methadone for two years. These doses were approximately 1.3 and 2.3 times the HDD. In contrast, female rats consumed 46 mg/kg/day or 88 mg/kg/day for two years. These doses were approximately 3.7 and 7.1 times the HDD. Under the conditions of the assay, there was no clear evidence for a treatment-related increase in the incidence of neoplasms in either male or female rats.



  Mutagenesis -  There are several published reports on the potential genetic toxicity of methadone. Methadone tested negative in tests for chromosome breakage and disjunction and sex-linked recessive lethal gene mutations in germ cells of Drosophila  using feeding and injection procedures. In contrast, methadone tested positive in the in vivo  mouse dominant lethal assay and the in vivo  mammalian spermatogonial chromosome aberration test. Additionally, methadone tested positive in the E. coli  DNA repair system and Neurospora crassa  and mouse lymphoma forward mutation assays.



  Impairment of Fertility -  Published animal studies provide additional data indicating that methadone treatment of males can alter reproductive function. Methadone produces decreased sexual activity (mating) of male rats at 10 mg/kg/day (corresponding to 0.3 times the human daily oral dose of 120 mg/day based on body surface area). Methadone also produces a significant regression of sex accessory organs and testes of male mice and rats at 0.2 and 0.8 times the HDD, respectively. Methadone treatment of pregnant rats from Gestation Day 14 to 19 reduced fetal blood testosterone and androstenedione in male. Decreased serum levels of testosterone were observed in male rats that were treated with methadone (1.3 to 3.3 mg/kg/day for 14 days, corresponding to 0.1 to 0.3 times the HDD) or 10 to 15 mg/kg/day for 10 days (0.8 to 1.2 times the HDD).



  Pregnancy  



  Pregnancy Category C.  Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) is an expected and treatable outcome of prolonged use of opioids during pregnancy ( see     WARNINGS    ).



 There are no controlled studies of methadone use in pregnant women that can be used to establish safety. However, an expert review of published data on experiences with methadone use during pregnancy by the Teratogen Information System (TERIS) concluded that maternal use of methadone during pregnancy as part of a supervised, therapeutic regimen is unlikely to pose a substantial teratogenic risk (quantity and quality of data assessed as "limited to fair"). However, the data are insufficient to state that there is no risk (TERIS, last reviewed October, 2002). Pregnant women involved in methadone maintenance programs have been reported to have significantly improved prenatal care leading to significantly reduced incidence of obstetric and fetal complications and neonatal morbidity and mortality when compared to women using illicit drugs. Several factors complicate the interpretation of investigations of the children of women who take methadone during pregnancy. These include the maternal use of illicit drugs, other maternal factors such as nutrition, infection, and psychosocial circumstances, limited information regarding dose and duration of methadone use during pregnancy, and the fact that most maternal exposure appears to occur after the first trimester of pregnancy. Reported studies have generally compared the benefit of methadone to the risk of untreated addiction to illicit drugs.



 Methadone has been detected in amniotic fluid and cord plasma at concentrations proportional to maternal plasma and in newborn urine at lower concentrations than corresponding maternal urine.



 A retrospective series of 101 pregnant, opiate-dependent women who underwent inpatient opiate detoxification with methadone did not demonstrate any increased risk of miscarriage in the second trimester or premature delivery in the third trimester.



 Several studies have suggested that infants born to narcotic-addicted women treated with methadone during all or part of pregnancy have been found to have decreased fetal growth with reduced birth weight, length, and/or head circumference compared to controls. This growth deficit does not appear to persist into later childhood. However, children born to women treated with methadone during pregnancy have been shown to demonstrate mild but persistent deficits in performance on psychometric and behavioral tests.



 In published animal reproduction studies, methadone administered subcutaneously during the early gestational period produced neural tube defects (i.e., exencephaly and cranioschisis) in the hamster at doses 2 times the human daily oral dose of 120 mg/day on a mg/m  2  basis (HDD) and in mice at doses equivalent to the HDD. Administration of methadone to pregnant animals during organogenesis and through lactation resulted decreased litter size, pup mortality, decreased pup body weights, developmental delays, and long-term neurochemical changes in the brain of offspring which correlate with altered behavioral responses that persist through adulthood at exposures comparable to and less than the HDD. Administration of methadone to male rodents prior to mating with untreated females resulted in increased neonatal mortality and significant differences in behavioral tests in the offspring at exposures comparable to and less than the HDD ( see   Data  ). Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.



 Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome may occur in newborn infants of mothers who are receiving treatment with METHADOSE.



 Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea, and/or failure to gain weight. Signs of neonatal withdrawal usually occur in the first days after birth. The duration and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome may vary. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly ( see     WARNINGS, Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome    ).



 Abnormal fetal nonstress tests (NSTs) have been reported to occur more frequently when the test is performed 1 to 2 hours after a maintenance dose of methadone in late pregnancy compared to controls.



  Data  



  Animal Data  



 Formal reproductive and developmental toxicology studies for methadone have not been conducted.  Exposure margins for the following published study reports are based on a human daily dose (HDD) of 120 mg methadone using a body surface area comparison.



 In a published study in pregnant hamsters, a single subcutaneous dose of methadone ranging from 31 mg/kg (2 times the HDD) to 185 mg/kg on Gestation Day 8 resulted in a decrease in the number of fetuses per litter and an increase in the percentage of fetuses exhibiting neural tube defects including exencephaly, cranioschisis, and "various other lesions." The majority of the doses tested also resulted in maternal death. In a study in pregnant mice, a single subcutaneous dose of 22 to 24 mg/kg methadone (approximately equivalent to the HDD) administered on Gestation Day 9 produced exencephaly in 11% of the embryos. In another study in pregnant mice, subcutaneous doses up to 28 mg/kg/day methadone (equivalent to the HDD) administered from Gestation Day 6 to 15 resulted in no malformations, but there were increased postimplantation loss and decreased live fetuses at 10 mg/kg/day or greater (0.4 times the HDD) and decreased ossification and fetal body weight at 20 mg/kg/day or greater (0.8 times the HDD). In a second study of pregnant mice dosed with subcutaneous doses up to 28 mg/kg/day methadone from Gestation Day 6 to 15, there was decreased pup viability, delayed onset of development of negative phototaxis and eye opening, increased righting reflexes at 5 mg/kg/day or greater (0.2 times the HDD), and decreased number of live pups at birth and decreased pup weight gain at 20 mg/kg/day or greater (0.8 times the HDD). No effects were reported in a study of pregnant rats and rabbits at oral doses up to 40 mg/kg (3 and 6 times, respectively, the HDD) administered from Gestation Days 6 to 15 and 6 to 18, respectively.



 When pregnant rats were treated with intraperitoneal doses of 2.5, 5, or 7.5 mg/kg methadone from one week prior to mating, through gestation until the end of lactation period, 5 mg/kg or greater (0.4 times the HDD) methadone resulted in decreases in litter size and live pups born and 7.5 mg/kg (0.6 times the HDD) resulted in decreased birth weights. Furthermore, decreased pup viability and pup body weight gain at 2.5 mg/kg or greater (0.2 times the HDD) were noted during the preweaning period.



 Additional animal data demonstrates evidence for neurochemical changes in the brains of offspring from methadone-treated pregnant rats, including changes to the cholinergic, dopaminergic, noradrenergic and serotonergic systems at doses below the HDD. Other animal studies have reported that prenatal and/or postnatal exposure to opioids including methadone alters neuronal development and behavior in the offspring including alterations in learning ability, motor activity, thermal regulation, nociceptive responses, and sensitivity to drugs at doses below the HDD. Treatment of pregnant rats subcutaneously with 5 mg/kg methadone from Gestation Day 14 to 19 (0.4 times the HDD) reduced fetal blood testosterone and androstenedione in males.



 Published animal data have reported increased neonatal mortality in the offspring of male rodents that were treated with methadone at doses comparable to and less than the HDD for 1 to 12 days before and/or during mating (with more pronounced effects in the first 4 days). In these studies, the female rodents were not treated with methadone, indicating paternally-mediated developmental toxicity. Specifically, methadone administered to the male rat prior to mating with methadone-naive females resulted in decreased weight gain in progeny after weaning. The male progeny demonstrated reduced thymus weights, whereas the female progeny demonstrated increased adrenal weights. Behavioral testing of these male and female progeny revealed significant differences in behavioral tests compared to control animals, suggesting that paternal methadone exposure can produce physiological and behavioral changes in progeny in this model. Examination of uterine contents of methadone-naive female mice bred to methadone-treated male mice (once a day for three consecutive days) indicated that methadone treatment produced an increase in the rate of preimplantation deaths in all post-meiotic states at 1 mg/kg/day or greater (0.04 times the HDD). Chromosome analysis revealed a dose-dependent increase in the frequency of chromosomal abnormalities at 1 mg/kg/day or greater.



 Studies demonstrated that methadone treatment of male rats for 21 to 32 days prior to mating with methadone-naive females did not produce any adverse effects, suggesting that prolonged methadone treatment of the male rat resulted in tolerance to the developmental toxicities noted in the progeny. Mechanistic studies in this rat model suggest that the developmental effects of "paternal" methadone on the progeny appear to be due to decreased testosterone production. These animal data mirror the reported clinical findings of decreased testosterone levels in human males on methadone maintenance therapy for opioid addiction and in males receiving chronic intraspinal opioids.



  Labor and Delivery  



 As with all opioids, administration of this product to the mother shortly before delivery may result in some degree of respiratory depression in the newborn, especially if higher doses are used. Methadone is not recommended for obstetric analgesia because its long duration of action increases the probability of respiratory depression in the newborn. Narcotics with mixed agonist/antagonist properties should not be used for pain control during labor in patients chronically treated with methadone as they may precipitate acute withdrawal.



  Lactation  



  Risk Summary  



 Based on two studies in 22 breastfeeding women maintained on methadone treatment, methadone was present in low levels in human milk, and did not show adverse reactions in breastfed infants. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for methadone and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from the drug or from the underlying maternal condition.



  Clinical Considerations  



 Advise breastfeeding women taking methadone to monitor the infant for increased drowsiness and breathing difficulties.



  Data  



 In a study of ten breastfeeding women maintained on oral methadone doses of 10 to 80 mg/day, methadone concentrations from 50 to 570 mcg/L in milk were reported, which, in the majority of samples, were lower than maternal serum drug concentrations at steady state.



 In a study of twelve breastfeeding women maintained on oral methadone doses of 20 to 80 mg/day, methadone concentrations from 39 to 232 mcg/L in milk were reported. Based on an average milk consumption of 150 mL/kg/day, an infant would consume approximately 17.4 mcg/kg/day, which is approximately 2 to 3% of the oral maternal dose. Methadone has been detected in very low plasma concentrations in some infants whose mothers were taking methadone.



 There have been rare cases of sedation and respiratory depression in infants exposed to methadone through breast milk.

 Chronic use of opioids may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible ( see     ADVERSE REACTIONS    ). Reproductive function in human males may be decreased by methadone treatment. Reductions in ejaculate volume and seminal vesicle and prostate secretions have been reported in methadone-treated individuals. In addition, reductions in serum testosterone levels and sperm motility, and abnormalities in sperm morphology have been reported.



  Pediatric Use  



 Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 18 years have not been established.



  Geriatric Use  



 Clinical studies of methadone did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently compared to younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for elderly patients should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.



 Methadone is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.



  Hepatic Impairment  



 The use of methadone has not been extensively evaluated in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Methadone is metabolized in the liver and patients with liver impairment may be at risk of accumulating methadone after multiple dosing. Start these patients on lower doses and titrate slowly while carefully monitoring for signs of respiratory and central nervous system depression.



  Renal Impairment  



 The use of methadone has not been extensively evaluated in patients with renal insufficiency. Since unmetabolized methadone and its metabolites are excreted in urine to a variable degree, start these patients on lower doses and with longer dosing intervals and titrate slowly while carefully monitoring for signs of respiratory and central nervous system depression.

 METHADOSE and METHADOSE Sugar-Free are for oral administration only. The preparation must not be injected. METHADOSE and METHADOSE Sugar-Free, if dispensed, should be packaged in child-resistant containers and kept out of reach of children to prevent accidental ingestion.   
        Life-Threatening   Respiratory Depression  
 

 Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of methadone, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with a "sighing" pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status ( see     OVERDOSAGE    ).



 While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of METHADOSE, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dose increase. The peak respiratory depressant effect of methadone occurs later, and persists longer than the peak pharmacologic effect, especially during the initial dosing period. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, when initiating therapy with METHADOSE and following dose increases.



 Instruct patients against use by individuals other than the patient for whom methadone was prescribed and to keep methadone out of the reach of children, as such inappropriate use may result in fatal respiratory depression.



 To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of methadone are essential ( see     DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION    ). Overestimating the methadone dosage when initiating treatment can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. 



 To further reduce the risk of respiratory depression, consider the following:



 *    Patients tolerant to other opioids may be incompletely tolerant to methadone . Incomplete cross-tolerance is of particular concern for patients tolerant to other mu-opioid agonists.  Deaths have been reported during conversion from chronic, high-dose treatment with other opioid agonists.  Follow induction directions closely to avoid inadvertent overdose ( see    DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION   ).
 
    

 item{  Proper dosing and titration are essential and methadone should be overseen only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of methadone.
 

}}  Risks from Concomitant Use of Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants with Methadone  



 Concomitant use of methadone and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants increases the risk of adverse reactions including overdose and death. Medication-assisted treatment of opioid use disorder, however, should not be categorically denied to patients taking these drugs. Prohibiting or creating barriers to treatment can pose an even greater risk of morbidity and mortality due to the opioid use disorder alone.



 As a routine part of orientation to methadone treatment, educate patients about the risks of concomitant use of benzodiazepines, sedatives, opioid analgesics, or alcohol.



 Develop strategies to manage use of prescribed or illicit benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants at admission to methadone treatment, or if it emerges as a concern during treatment. Adjustments to induction procedures and additional monitoring may be required. There is no evidence to support dose limitations or arbitrary caps of methadone as a strategy to address benzodiazepine use in methadone-treated patients. However, if a patient is sedated at the time of methadone dosing, ensure that a medically-trained healthcare provider evaluates the cause of sedation and delays or omits the methadone dose if appropriate.



 Cessation of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants is preferred in most cases of concomitant use. In some cases monitoring in a higher level of care for taper may be appropriate. In others, gradually tapering a patient off a prescribed benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant or decreasing to the lowest effective dose may be appropriate.



 For patients in methadone treatment, benzodiazepines are not the treatment of choice for anxiety or insomnia. Before co-prescribing benzodiazepines, ensure that patients are appropriately diagnosed and consider alternative medications and non-pharmacologic treatments to address anxiety or insomnia. Ensure that other healthcare providers prescribing benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants are aware of the patient's methadone treatment and coordinate care to minimize the risks associated with concomitant use.



 In addition, take measures to confirm that patients are taking the medications prescribed and not diverting or supplementing with illicit drugs. Toxicology screening should test for prescribed and illicit benzodiazepines (see   PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions    ).



  Life-Threatening QT Prolongation  



 Cases of QT interval prolongation and serious arrhythmia (torsades de pointes) have been observed during treatment with methadone. These cases appear to be more commonly associated with, but not limited to, higher dose treatment (&gt; 200 mg/day). Most cases involve patients being treated for pain with large, multiple daily doses of methadone, although cases have been reported in patients receiving doses commonly used for maintenance treatment of opioid addiction. In most patients on the lower doses typically used for maintenance, concomitant medications and/or clinical conditions such as hypokalemia were noted as contributing factors. However, the evidence strongly suggests that methadone possesses the potential for adverse cardiac conduction effects in some patients.  The effects of methadone on the QT interval have been confirmed in in vivo  laboratory studies, and methadone has been shown to inhibit cardiac potassium channels in in vitro  studies.



 Closely monitor patients with risk factors for development of prolonged QT interval (e.g., cardiac hypertrophy, concomitant diuretic use, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia), a history of cardiac conduction abnormalities, and those taking medications affecting cardiac conduction. QT prolongation has also been reported in patients with no prior cardiac history who have received high doses of methadone.



 Evaluate patients developing QT prolongation while on METHADOSE treatment for the presence of modifiable risk factors, such as concomitant medications with cardiac effects, drugs which might cause electrolyte abnormalities, and drugs which might act as inhibitors of methadone metabolism.



 Only initiate therapy with METHADOSE in patients for whom the anticipated benefit outweighs the risk of QT prolongation and development of dysrhythmias that have been reported with high doses of methadone. The use of methadone in patients already known to have a prolonged QT interval has not been systematically studied.



  Accidental Ingestion  



 Accidental ingestion of even one dose of METHADOSE, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose. Keep METHADOSE out of reach of children to prevent accidental ingestion.



  Misuse, Abuse, and Diversion of Opioids  



 METHADOSE contain methadone, an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance. Methadone can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. Opioid agonists are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion.



 Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.



  Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome  



 Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) is an expected and treatable outcome of prolonged use of opioids during pregnancy, whether that use is medically-authorized or illicit. Unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, NOWS may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated in the neonate. Healthcare professionals should observe newborns for signs of NOWS and manage accordingly ( see     PRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy    ).



 Advise pregnant women receiving opioid addiction treatment with METHADOSE of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available. This risk must be balanced against the risk of untreated opioid addiction which often results in continued or relapsing illicit opioid use and is associated with poor pregnancy outcomes. Therefore, prescribers should discuss the importance and benefits of management of opioid addiction throughout pregnancy.



  Risks of Concomitant Use of Cytochrome P450 3A4, 2B6, 2C19, 2C9, or 2D6 Inhibitors or Discontinuation P450 3A4, 2B6, 2C19, or 2C9 Inducers  



 Concomitant use of METHADOSE with CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, or CYP2D6 inhibitors, may increase plasma concentrations of methadone, prolong opioid adverse reactions, and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression, particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of METHADOSE is achieved.  Similarly, discontinuation of concomitant CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, or CYP2C9 inducers in METHADOSE-treated patients may increase methadone plasma concentrations resulting in fatal respiratory depression.  Consider dosage reduction of METHADOSE when using concomitant CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9 or CYP2D6 inhibitors or discontinuing CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, or CYP2C9 inducers in methadone-treated patients, and follow patients closely at frequent intervals for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.



 Addition  of  CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, or CYP2C9 inducers or discontinuation of a CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, or CYP2D6 inhibitors in patients treated with METHADOSE may decrease methadone plasma concentrations, reducing efficacy or, and may, lead to a withdrawal symptoms in patients physically dependent on methadone.  When using METHADOSE with CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, or CYP2C9 inducers or discontinuing CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, or CYP2D6 inhibitors, follow patients for signs or symptoms of opioid withdrawal and consider increasing the METHADOSE dosage as needed.



  Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients  



 The use of METHADOSE in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated.



  Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease   -  METHADOSE-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of METHADOSE ( see     WARNINGS,       Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression    ).  



  Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients     -      Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients ( see     WARNINGS,       Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression    ).



 Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating METHADOSE and when METHADOSE is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration.



  Serotonin Syndrome with Concomitant Use of Serotonergic Drugs  



 Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of METHADOSE with serotonergic drugs. Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including MAO inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue) ( see     PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions    ). This may occur within the recommended dosage range.



 Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days of concomitant use, but may occur later than that. Discontinue METHADOSE if serotonin syndrome is suspected.



  Adrenal Insufficiency  



 Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.



  Severe Hypotension  



 Methadone may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain normal blood pressure is compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) ( see     PRECAUTIONS,       Drug Interactions    ). Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of METHADOSE. In patients with circulatory shock, METHADOSE may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of METHADOSE in patients with circulatory shock.



  Use in Patients with Head Injury or Increased Intracranial Pressure  



 In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors) ,  METHADOSE may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2retention can further increase intracranial pressure .  Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with methadone. 



 Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury.



 Avoid the use of methadone in patients with impaired consciousness or coma.



  Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions  



 METHADOSE is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The methadone in METHADOSE may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in the serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms.



  Increased Risks of Seizure in Patients with Seizure Disorders  



 Methadone may increase frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and increase the risks of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures.  Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during METHADOSE therapy.



  Withdrawal  



 Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist, including METHADOSE. In these patients, mixed agonists/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may precipitate withdrawal symptoms ( see     PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions    ).



 When discontinuing METHADOSE, gradually taper the dosage ( see     DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION    ).  Do not abruptly discontinue METHADOSE.



  Use in Ambulatory Patients  



  Driving or Operating Heavy Machinery  



 Inform patients that METHADOSE may impair the ability to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving or operating heavy machinery. Advise patients not to perform such tasks until they know how they will react to the medication ( see     PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients    ).



  Laboratory Test Interactions  



 False positive urine drug screens for methadone have been reported for several drugs including diphenhydramine, doxylamine, clomipramaine, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, quetiapine, and verapamil.
