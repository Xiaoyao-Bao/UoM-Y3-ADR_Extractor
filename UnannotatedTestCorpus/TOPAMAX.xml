  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the incidence of adverse reactions observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the incidence of adverse reactions in the clinical trials of another drug, and may not reflect the incidence of adverse reactions observed in practice.

     Monotherapy Epilepsy  

     Adults 16 Years of Age and Older  

 The most common adverse reactions in the controlled clinical trial that occurred in adults in the 400 mg/day TOPAMAX  (r)  group and at an incidence higher (&gt;= 10 %) than in the 50 mg/day group were: paresthesia, weight loss and anorexia (see  Table 5  ).

 Approximately 21% of the 159 adult patients in the 400 mg/day group who received TOPAMAX  (r)  as monotherapy in the controlled clinical trial discontinued therapy due to adverse reactions. The most common (&gt;= 2% more frequent than low-dose 50 mg/day TOPAMAX  (r)  ) adverse reactions causing discontinuation were difficulty with memory, fatigue, asthenia, insomnia, somnolence, and paresthesia.

     Pediatric Patients 6 to 15 Years of Age  

 The most common adverse reactions in the controlled clinical trial that occurred in pediatric patients in the 400 mg/day TOPAMAX  (r)  group and at an incidence higher (&gt;=10%) than in the 50 mg/day group were fever and weight loss (see  Table 5  ).

 Approximately 14% of the 77 pediatric patients in the 400 mg/day group who received TOPAMAX  (r)  as monotherapy in the controlled clinical trial discontinued therapy due to adverse reactions. The most common (&gt;=2% more frequent than low-dose 50 mg/day TOPAMAX  (r)  ) adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation were difficulty with concentration/attention, fever, flushing, and confusion.

 Table 5 presents the incidence of adverse reactions occurring in at least 3% of adult and pediatric patients treated with 400 mg/day TOPAMAX  (r)  and occurring with greater incidence than 50 mg/day TOPAMAX  (r)  .

               Adjunctive Therapy Epilepsy  
 

     Adults 16 Years of Age and Older  

 In pooled controlled clinical trials in adults with partial onset seizures, primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, or Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, 183 patients received adjunctive therapy with TOPAMAX  (r)  at dosages of 200 to 400 mg/day (recommended dosage range) and 291 patients received placebo. Patients in these trials were receiving 1 to 2 concomitant antiepileptic drugs in addition to TOPAMAX  (r)  or placebo.

 The most common adverse reactions in the controlled clinical trial that occurred in adult patients in the 200-400 mg/day TOPAMAX  (r)  group with an incidence higher (&gt;= 10 %) than in the placebo group were: dizziness, speech disorders/related speech problems, somnolence, nervousness, psychomotor slowing, and vision abnormal (Table 6).

 Table 6 presents the incidence of adverse reactions occurring in at least 3% of adult patients treated with 200 to 400 mg/day TOPAMAX  (r)  and was greater than placebo incidence. The incidence of some adverse reactions (e.g., fatigue, dizziness, paresthesia, language problems, psychomotor slowing, depression, difficulty with concentration/attention, mood problems) was dose-related and much greater at higher than recommended TOPAMAX  (r)  dosing (i.e., 600 mg - 1000 mg daily) compared to the incidence of these adverse reactions at the recommended dosing (200 mg to 400 mg daily) range.

         In controlled clinical trials in adults, 11% of patients receiving TOPAMAX  (r)  200 to 400 mg/day as adjunctive therapy discontinued due to adverse reactions. This rate appeared to increase at dosages above 400 mg/day. Adverse reactions associated with discontinuing TOPAMAX  (r)  included somnolence, dizziness, anxiety, difficulty with concentration or attention, fatigue, and paresthesia and increased at dosages above 400 mg/day.
 

     Pediatric Patients 2 to 15 Years of Age  

 In pooled, controlled clinical trials in pediatric patients (2 to 15 years of age) with partial onset seizures, primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, or Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, 98 patients received adjunctive therapy with TOPAMAX  (r)  at dosages of 5 to 9 mg/kg/day (recommended dose range) and 101 patients received placebo.

 The most common adverse reactions in the controlled clinical trial that occurred in pediatric patients in the 5 mg to 9 mg/kg/day TOPAMAX  (r)  group with an incidence higher (&gt;= 10 %) than in the placebo group were: fatigue and somnolence (Table 7).

 Table 7 presents the incidence of adverse reactions that occurred in at least 3% of pediatric patients 2 to 15 years of age receiving 5 mg to 9 mg/kg/day (recommended dose range) of TOPAMAX  (r)  and was greater than placebo incidence.

 Table 7: Adverse Reactions in Pooled Placebo-Controlled, Add-On Epilepsy Trials in Pediatric Patients 2 to 15 Years of AgePatients in these add-on/adjunctive trials were receiving 1 to 2 concomitant antiepileptic drugs in addition to TOPAMAX(r) or placebo.,Values represent the percentage of patients reporting a given adverse reaction. Patients may have reported more than one adverse reaction during the study and can be included in more than one adverse reaction category.

     Migraine  

     Adults  

 In the four multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group migraine prophylaxis clinical trials (which included 35 pediatric patients 12 to 15 years of age), most adverse reactions occurred more frequently during the titration period than during the maintenance period.

 The most common adverse reactions with TOPAMAX  (r)  100 mg in migraine prophylaxis clinical trials of predominantly adults that were seen at an incidence higher (&gt;= 5 %) than in the placebo group were: paresthesia, anorexia, weight loss, taste perversion, diarrhea, difficulty with memory, hypoesthesia, and nausea (see  Table 8  ).

 Table 8 includes those adverse reactions that occurred in the placebo-controlled trials where the incidence in any TOPAMAX  (r)  treatment group was at least 3% and was greater than that for placebo patients. The incidence of some adverse reactions (e.g., fatigue, dizziness, somnolence, difficulty with memory, difficulty with concentration/attention) was dose-related and greater at higher than recommended TOPAMAX  (r)  dosing (200 mg daily) compared to the incidence of these adverse reactions at the recommended dosing (100 mg daily).

Patients may have reported more than one adverse reaction during the study and can be included in more than one adverse reaction category.

 Blurred vision [note: Blurred vision was the most common term considered as vision abnormal. Blurred vision was an included term that accounted for &gt;50% of reactions coded as vision abnormal, a preferred term.]   2                     4                     2                      
          Of the 1,135 patients exposed to TOPAMAX  (r)  in the adult placebo-controlled studies, 25% of TOPAMAX  (r)  -treated patients discontinued due to adverse reactions, compared to 10% of the 445 placebo-treated patients. The adverse reactions associated with discontinuing therapy in the TOPAMAX  (r)  -treated patients included paresthesia (7%), fatigue (4%), nausea (4%), difficulty with concentration/attention (3%), insomnia (3%), anorexia (2%), and dizziness (2%).
 

 Patients treated with TOPAMAX  (r)  experienced mean percent reductions in body weight that were dose-dependent. This change was not seen in the placebo group. Mean changes of 0%, -2%, -3%, and -4% were seen for the placebo group, TOPAMAX  (r)  50, 100, and 200 mg groups, respectively.

     Pediatric Patients 12 to 17 Years of Age  

 In five, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group migraine prophylaxis clinical trials, most adverse reactions occurred more frequently during the titration period than during the maintenance period. Among adverse reactions with onset during titration, approximately half persisted into the maintenance period.

 In four, fixed-dose, double-blind migraine prophylaxis clinical trials in TOPAMAX  (r)  -treated pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age, the most common adverse reactions with TOPAMAX  (r)  100 mg that were seen at an incidence higher (&gt;=5%) than in the placebo group were: paresthesia, upper respiratory tract infection, anorexia, and abdominal pain (see  Table 9  ). Table 9 shows adverse reactions from the pediatric trial (Study 12  [see  Clinical Studies (14.3)  ]  ) in which 103 pediatric patients were treated with placebo or 50 mg or 100 mg of TOPAMAX  (r)  , and three predominantly adult trials in which 49 pediatric patients (12 to 17 years of age) were treated with placebo or 50 mg, 100 mg or 200 mg of TOPAMAX  (r)  . Table 9 also shows adverse reactions in pediatric patients in the controlled migraine trials when the incidence in a TOPAMAX  (r)  dose group was at least 5 % or higher and greater than the incidence of placebo. Many adverse reactions shown in Table 9 indicate a dose-dependent relationship. The incidence of some adverse reactions (e.g., allergy, fatigue, headache, anorexia, insomnia, somnolence, and viral infection) was dose-related and greater at higher than recommended TOPAMAX  (r)  dosing (200 mg daily) compared to the incidence of these adverse reactions at the recommended dosing (100 mg daily).

          In the double-blind placebo-controlled studies, adverse reactions led to discontinuation of treatment in 8% of placebo patients compared with 6% of TOPAMAX  (r)  -treated patients. Adverse reactions associated with discontinuing therapy that occurred in more than one TOPAMAX  (r)  -treated patient were fatigue (1%), headache (1%), and somnolence (1%).
 

     Increased Risk for Bleeding  

 TOPAMAX  (r)  is associated with an increased risk for bleeding. In a pooled analysis of placebo-controlled studies of approved and unapproved indications, bleeding was more frequently reported as an adverse reaction for TOPAMAX  (r)  than for placebo (4.5% versus 3.0% in adult patients, and 4.4% versus 2.3% in pediatric patients). In this analysis, the incidence of serious bleeding events for TOPAMAX  (r)  and placebo was 0.3% versus 0.2% for adult patients, and 0.4% versus 0% for pediatric patients.

 Adverse bleeding reactions reported with TOPAMAX  (r)  ranged from mild epistaxis, ecchymosis, and increased menstrual bleeding to life-threatening hemorrhages. In patients with serious bleeding events, conditions that increased the risk for bleeding were often present, or patients were often taking drugs that cause thrombocytopenia (other antiepileptic drugs) or affect platelet function or coagulation (e.g., aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or warfarin or other anticoagulants).

     Other Adverse Reactions Observed During Clinical Trials  

 Other adverse reactions seen during clinical trials were: abnormal coordination, eosinophilia, gingival bleeding, hematuria, hypotension, myalgia, myopia, postural hypotension, scotoma, suicide attempt, syncope, and visual field defect.

     Laboratory Test Abnormalities  

   Adult Patients

 In addition to changes in serum bicarbonate (i.e., metabolic acidosis), sodium chloride and ammonia, TOPAMAX  (r)  was associated with changes in several clinical laboratory analytes in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.4  ,  5.9)  ].  Controlled trials of adjunctive TOPAMAX  (r)  treatment of adults for partial onset seizures showed an increased incidence of markedly decreased serum phosphorus (6% TOPAMAX  (r)  versus 2% placebo), markedly increased serum alkaline phosphatase (3% TOPAMAX  (r)  versus 1% placebo), and decreased serum potassium (0.4 % TOPAMAX  (r)  versus 0.1 % placebo).

     Pediatric Patients  

 In pediatric patients (1-24 months) receiving adjunctive TOPAMAX  (r)  for partial onset seizures, there was an increased incidence for an increased result (relative to normal analyte reference range) associated with TOPAMAX  (r)  (vs placebo) for the following clinical laboratory analytes: creatinine, BUN, alkaline phosphatase, and total protein, The incidence was also increased for a decreased result for bicarbonate (i.e., metabolic acidosis), and potassium with TOPAMAX  (r)  (vs placebo)  [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.4)  ].  TOPAMAX  (r)  is not indicated for partial onset seizures in pediatric patients less than 2 years of age.

 In pediatric patients (ranging from 6-17 years old) receiving TOPAMAX  (r)  for migraine prophylaxis, there was an increased incidence for an increased result (relative to normal analyte reference range) associated with TOPAMAX  (r)  (vs placebo) for the following clinical laboratory analytes: creatinine, BUN, uric acid, chloride, ammonia, alkaline phosphatase, total protein, platelets, and eosinophils, The incidence was also increased for a decreased result for phosphorus, bicarbonate, total white blood count, and neutrophils  [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.4)    ]. TOPAMAX  (r)  is not indicated for prophylaxis of migraine headache in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age.

   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of TOPAMAX  (r)  . Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

   Body as a Whole-General Disorders:  oligohydrosis and hyperthermia  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  , hyperammonemia, hyperammonemic encephalopathy  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.9)  ],  hypothermia with concomitant valproic acid  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.11)  ]  

   Gastrointestinal System Disorders:  hepatic failure (including fatalities), hepatitis, pancreatitis

   Skin and Appendage Disorders:  bullous skin reactions (including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis), pemphigus

   Urinary System Disorders:  kidney stones  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.10)  ]  

   Vision Disorders:  acute myopia, secondary angle closure glaucoma  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  , maculopathy

   5.1 Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle Closure Glaucoma

  A syndrome consisting of acute myopia associated with secondary angle closure glaucoma has been reported in patients receiving TOPAMAX  (r)  . Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity and/or ocular pain. Ophthalmologic findings can include myopia, anterior chamber shallowing, ocular hyperemia (redness), and increased intraocular pressure. Mydriasis may or may not be present. This syndrome may be associated with supraciliary effusion resulting in anterior displacement of the lens and iris, with secondary angle closure glaucoma. Symptoms typically occur within 1 month of initiating TOPAMAX  (r)  therapy. In contrast to primary narrow angle glaucoma, which is rare under 40 years of age, secondary angle closure glaucoma associated with topiramate has been reported in pediatric patients as well as adults. The primary treatment to reverse symptoms is discontinuation of TOPAMAX  (r)  as rapidly as possible, according to the judgment of the treating physician. Other measures, in conjunction with discontinuation of TOPAMAX  (r)  , may be helpful.

 Elevated intraocular pressure of any etiology, if left untreated, can lead to serious sequelae including permanent vision loss.

    5.2 Visual Field Defects

  Visual field defects (independent of elevated intraocular pressure) have been reported in clinical trials and in postmarketing experience in patients receiving topiramate. In clinical trials, most of these events were reversible after topiramate discontinuation. If visual problems occur at any time during topiramate treatment, consideration should be given to discontinuing the drug.

    5.3 Oligohidrosis and Hyperthermia

  Oligohidrosis (decreased sweating), infrequently resulting in hospitalization, has been reported in association with TOPAMAX  (r)  use. Decreased sweating and an elevation in body temperature above normal characterized these cases. Some of the cases were reported after exposure to elevated environmental temperatures.

 The majority of the reports have been in pediatric patients. Patients (especially pediatric patients) treated with TOPAMAX  (r)  should be monitored closely for evidence of decreased sweating and increased body temperature, especially in hot weather. Caution should be used when TOPAMAX  (r)  is given with other drugs that predispose patients to heat-related disorders; these drugs include, but are not limited to, other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and drugs with anticholinergic activity.

    5.4 Metabolic Acidosis

  TOPAMAX  (r)  can cause hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to carbonic anhydrase inhibition by TOPAMAX  (r)  . TOPAMAX  (r)  -induced metabolic acidosis can occur at any time during treatment. Bicarbonate decrements are usually mild-moderate (average decrease of 4 mEq/L at daily doses of 400 mg in adults and at approximately 6 mg/kg/day in pediatric patients); rarely, patients can experience severe decrements to values below 10 mEq/L. Conditions or therapies that predispose patients to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet, or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of TOPAMAX  (r)  .

 Metabolic acidosis was commonly observed in adult and pediatric patients treated with TOPAMAX  (r)  in clinical trials. The incidence of decreased serum bicarbonate in pediatric trials, for adjunctive treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or refractory partial onset seizures was as high as 67% for TOPAMAX  (r)  (at approximately 6 mg/kg/day), and 10% for placebo. The incidence of a markedly abnormally low serum bicarbonate (i.e., absolute value &lt; 17 mEq/L and &gt;5 mEq/L decrease from pretreatment) in these trials was up to 11%, compared to &lt;= 2% for placebo.

 Manifestations of acute or chronic metabolic acidosis may include hyperventilation, nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and anorexia, or more severe sequelae including cardiac arrhythmias or stupor. Chronic, untreated metabolic acidosis may increase the risk for nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis, and may also result in osteomalacia (referred to as rickets in pediatric patients) and/or osteoporosis with an increased risk for fractures. Chronic metabolic acidosis in pediatric patients may also reduce growth rates, which may decrease the maximal height achieved. The effect of TOPAMAX  (r)  on growth and bone-related sequelae has not been systematically investigated in long-term, placebo-controlled trials. Long-term, open-label treatment of pediatric patients 1 to 24 months old with intractable partial epilepsy, for up to 1 year, showed reductions from baseline in length, weight, and head circumference compared to age and sex-matched normative data, although these patients with epilepsy are likely to have different growth rates than normal 1 to 24 month old pediatrics. Reductions in length and weight were correlated to the degree of acidosis [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.4)  ]  . TOPAMAX  (r)  treatment that causes metabolic acidosis during pregnancy can possibly produce adverse effects on the fetus and might also cause metabolic acidosis in the neonate from possible transfer of topiramate to the fetus [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.7)  ,  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ]  .

    Measurement of Serum Bicarbonate in Epilepsy and Migraine Patients  

 Measurement of baseline and periodic serum bicarbonate during topiramate treatment is recommended. If metabolic acidosis develops and persists, consideration should be given to reducing the dose or discontinuing TOPAMAX  (r)  (using dose tapering). If the decision is made to continue patients on TOPAMAX  (r)  in the face of persistent acidosis, alkali treatment should be considered.

    5.5 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation

  Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including TOPAMAX  (r)  , increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.

 Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.

 The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.

 The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.

 Table 4 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.

 Epilepsy              1.0                   3.4                   3.5                   2.4                    
 Psychiatric           5.7                   8.5                   1.5                   2.9

 Total                 2.4                   4.3                   1.8                   1.9                    
           The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.
 

 Anyone considering prescribing TOPAMAX  (r)  or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.

    5.6 Cognitive/Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions

  TOPAMAX  (r)  can cause cognitive/neuropsychiatric adverse reactions. The most frequent of these can be classified into three general categories: 1) Cognitive-related dysfunction (e.g., confusion, psychomotor slowing, difficulty with concentration/attention, difficulty with memory, speech or language problems, particularly word-finding difficulties); 2) Psychiatric/behavioral disturbances (e.g., depression or mood problems); and 3) Somnolence or fatigue.

    Adult Patients  

    Cognitive-Related Dysfunction  

 Rapid titration rate and higher initial dose were associated with higher incidences of cognitive-related dysfunction.

 In adult epilepsy add-on controlled trials, which used rapid titration (100-200 mg/day weekly increments), and target TOPAMAX  (r)  doses of 200 mg - 1000 mg/day, 56% of patients in the 800 mg/day and 1000 mg/day dose groups experienced cognitive-related dysfunction compared to approximately 42% of patients in the 200-400 mg/day groups and 14% for placebo. In this rapid titration regimen, these dose-related adverse reactions began in the titration or in the maintenance phase, and in some patients these events began during titration and persisted into the maintenance phase.

 In the monotherapy epilepsy controlled trial, the proportion of patients who experienced one or more cognitive-related adverse reactions was 19% for TOPAMAX  (r)  50 mg/day and 26% for 400 mg/day.

 In the 6-month migraine prophylaxis controlled trials, which used a slower titration regimen (25 mg/day weekly increments), the proportion of patients who experienced one or more cognitive-related adverse reactions was 19% for TOPAMAX  (r)  50 mg/day, 22% for 100 mg/day (the recommended dose), 28% for 200 mg/day, and 10% for placebo. Cognitive adverse reactions most commonly developed during titration and sometimes persisted after completion of titration.

    Psychiatric/Behavioral Disturbances  

 Psychiatric/behavioral disturbances (e.g., depression, mood) were dose-related for both the adjunctive epilepsy and migraine populations [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.5)  ].  

    Somnolence/Fatigue  

 Somnolence and fatigue were the adverse reactions most frequently reported during clinical trials of TOPAMAX  (r)  for adjunctive epilepsy. For the adjunctive epilepsy population, the incidence of fatigue, appeared dose related. For the monotherapy epilepsy population, the incidence of somnolence was dose-related. For the migraine population, the incidences of both fatigue and somnolence were dose-related and more common in the titration phase.

    Pediatric Patients  

 In pediatric epilepsy trials (adjunctive and monotherapy), the incidence of cognitive/neuropsychiatric adverse reactions was generally lower than that observed in adults. These reactions included psychomotor slowing, difficulty with concentration/attention, speech disorders/related speech problems, and language problems. The most frequently reported cognitive/neuropsychiatric reactions in pediatric epilepsy patients during adjunctive therapy double-blind studies were somnolence and fatigue. The most frequently reported cognitive/neuropsychiatric reactions in pediatric epilepsy patients in the 50 mg/day and 400 mg/day groups during the monotherapy double-blind study were headache, dizziness, anorexia, and somnolence.

 In pediatric migraine patients, the incidence of cognitive/neuropsychiatric adverse reactions was increased in TOPAMAX  (r)  -treated patients compared to placebo.

 The risk for cognitive/neuropsychiatric adverse reactions was dose-dependent, and was greatest at the highest dose (200 mg). This risk for cognitive/neuropsychiatric adverse reactions was also greater in younger patients (6 to 11 years of age) than in older patients (12 to 17 years of age). The most common cognitive/neuropsychiatric adverse reaction in these trials was difficulty with concentration/attention. Cognitive adverse reactions most commonly developed during titration and sometimes persisted for various durations after completion of titration.

 The Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) was administered to adolescents (12 to 17 years) to assess the effects of topiramate on cognitive function at baseline and at the end of the Study 12 [see  Clinical Studies (14.3)  ]  . Mean change from baseline in certain CANTAB tests suggests that topiramate treatment may result in psychomotor slowing and decreased verbal fluency.

    5.7 Fetal Toxicity

  TOPAMAX  (r)  can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Data from pregnancy registries indicate that infants exposed to topiramate in utero  have an increased risk for cleft lip and/or cleft palate (oral clefts) and for being small for gestational age. When multiple species of pregnant animals received topiramate at clinically relevant doses, structural malformations, including craniofacial defects, and reduced fetal weights occurred in offspring [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ]  .

 Consider the benefits and the risks of TOPAMAX  (r)  when administering this drug in women of childbearing potential, particularly when TOPAMAX  (r)  is considered for a condition not usually associated with permanent injury or death [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.8)  ,  Patient Counseling Information (17)  ]  . TOPAMAX  (r)  should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1  ,  8.8)  ]  .

    5.8 Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs

  In patients with or without a history of seizures or epilepsy, antiepileptic drugs, including TOPAMAX  (r)  , should be gradually withdrawn to minimize the potential for seizures or increased seizure frequency [see  Clinical Studies (14)  ]  . In situations where rapid withdrawal of TOPAMAX  (r)  is medically required, appropriate monitoring is recommended.

    5.9 Hyperammonemia and Encephalopathy (Without and With Concomitant Valproic Acid Use)

  Topiramate treatment can cause hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ]  . The risk for hyperammonemia with topiramate appears dose-related. Hyperammonemia has been reported more frequently when topiramate is used concomitantly with valproic acid. Postmarketing cases of hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy have been reported with topiramate and valproic acid in patients who previously tolerated either drug alone [see  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ]  .

 Clinical symptoms of hyperammonemic encephalopathy often include acute alterations in level of consciousness and/or cognitive function with lethargy and/or vomiting. In most cases, hyperammonemic encephalopathy abated with discontinuation of treatment.

 The incidence of hyperammonemia in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age in migraine prophylaxis trials was 26% in patients taking TOPAMAX  (r)  monotherapy at 100 mg/day, and 14% in patients taking TOPAMAX  (r)  at 50 mg/day, compared to 9% in patients taking placebo. There was also an increased incidence of markedly increased hyperammonemia at the 100 mg dose.

 Dose-related hyperammonemia was also seen in pediatric patients 1 to 24 months of age treated with TOPAMAX  (r)  and concomitant valproic acid for partial onset epilepsy and this was not due to a pharmacokinetic interaction.

 In some patients, hyperammonemia can be asymptomatic.

    Monitoring for Hyperammonemia  

 Patients with inborn errors of metabolism or reduced hepatic mitochondrial activity may be at an increased risk for hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy. Although not studied, topiramate treatment or an interaction of concomitant topiramate and valproic acid treatment may exacerbate existing defects or unmask deficiencies in susceptible persons.

 In patients who develop unexplained lethargy, vomiting or changes in mental status associated with any topiramate treatment, hyperammonemic encephalopathy should be considered and an ammonia level should be measured.

    5.10 Kidney Stones

  TOPAMAX  (r)  increases the risk of kidney stones. During adjunctive epilepsy trials, the risk for kidney stones in TOPAMAX  (r)  -treated adults was 1.5%, an incidence about 2 to 4 times greater than expected in a similar, untreated population. As in the general population, the incidence of stone formation among TOPAMAX  (r)  -treated patients was higher in men. Kidney stones have also been reported in pediatric patients taking TOPAMAX  (r)  for epilepsy or migraine. During long-term (up to 1 year) TOPAMAX  (r)  treatment in an open-label extension study of 284 pediatric patients 1-24 months old with epilepsy, 7% developed kidney or bladder stones. TOPAMAX  (r)  is not approved for treatment of epilepsy in pediatric patients less than 2 years old [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.4)  ].  

 TOPAMAX  (r)  is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors can promote stone formation by reducing urinary citrate excretion and by increasing urinary pH [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.4)  ]  . The concomitant use of TOPAMAX  (r)  with any other drug producing metabolic acidosis, or potentially in patients on a ketogenic diet, may create a physiological environment that increases the risk of kidney stone formation, and should therefore be avoided.

 Increased fluid intake increases the urinary output, lowering the concentration of substances involved in stone formation. Hydration is recommended to reduce new stone formation.

    5.11 Hypothermia with Concomitant Valproic Acid Use

  Hypothermia, defined as a drop in body core temperature to &lt;35 degrees C (95 degrees F), has been reported in association with topiramate use with concomitant valproic acid both in conjunction with hyperammonemia and in the absence of hyperammonemia. This adverse reaction in patients using concomitant topiramate and valproate can occur after starting topiramate treatment or after increasing the daily dose of topiramate [see  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ]  . Consideration should be given to stopping TOPAMAX  (r)  or valproate in patients who develop hypothermia, which may be manifested by a variety of clinical abnormalities including lethargy, confusion, coma, and significant alterations in other major organ systems such as the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Clinical management and assessment should include examination of blood ammonia levels.
