  univasc  (r)  has been evaluated for safety in more than 2500 patients with hypertension; more than 250 of these patients were treated for approximately one year. The overall incidence of reported adverse events was only slightly greater in patients treated with univasc  (r)  than patients treated with placebo.



 Reported adverse experiences were usually mild and transient, and there were no differences in adverse reaction rates related to gender, race, age, duration of therapy, or total daily dosage within the range of 3.75 mg to 60 mg. Discontinuation of therapy because of adverse experiences was required in 3.4% of patients treated with univasc  (r)  and in 1.8% of patients treated with placebo. The most common reasons for discontinuation in patients treated with univasc  (r)  were cough (0.7%) and dizziness (0.4%).



 All adverse experiences considered at least possibly related to treatment that occurred at any dose in placebo-controlled trials of once-daily dosing in more than 1% of patients treated with univasc  (r)  alone and that were at least as frequent in the univasc  (r)  group as in the placebo group are shown in the following table:

         Other adverse events occurring in more than 1% of patients on moexipril that were at least as frequent on placebo include: headache, upper respiratory infection, pain, rhinitis, dyspepsia, nausea, peripheral edema, sinusitis, chest pain, and urinary frequency. See  WARNINGS  and  PRECAUTIONS  for discussion of anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, hypotension, neutropenia/agranulocytosis, second and third trimester fetal/neonatal morbidity and mortality, hyperkalemia, and cough.
 

 Other potentially important adverse experiences reported in controlled or uncontrolled clinical trials in less than 1% of moexipril patients or that have been attributed to other ACE inhibitors include the following:



     Cardiovascular:    Symptomatic hypotension, postural hypotension, or syncope were seen in 9/1750 (0.51%) patients; these reactions led to discontinuation of therapy in controlled trials in 3/1254 (0.24%) patients who had received univasc  (r)  monotherapy and in 1/344 (0.3%) patients who had received univasc  (r)  with hydrochlorothiazide (see  PRECAUTIONS  and  WARNINGS  ). Other adverse events included angina/myocardial infarction, palpitations, rhythm disturbances, and cerebrovascular accident.



     Renal:    Of hypertensive patients with no apparent preexisting renal disease, 1% of patients receiving univasc  (r)  alone and 2% of patients receiving univasc  (r)  with hydrochlorothiazide experienced increases in serum creatinine to at least 140% of their baseline values (see  PRECAUTIONS  and  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  ).



     Gastrointestinal:    Abdominal pain, constipation, vomiting, appetite/weight change, dry mouth, pancreatitis, hepatitis.



     Respiratory:    Bronchospasm, dyspnea, eosinophilic pneumonitis.



     Urogenital:    Renal insufficiency, oliguria.



     Dermatologic:    Apparent hypersensitivity reactions manifested by urticaria, rash, pemphigus, pruritus, photosensitivity, alopecia.



     Neurological and Psychiatric:    Drowsiness, sleep disturbances, nervousness, mood changes, anxiety.



     Other:    Angioedema (see  WARNINGS  ), taste disturbances, tinnitus, sweating, malaise, arthralgia, hemolytic anemia.



   Clinical Laboratory Test Findings

    Serum Electrolytes  



 Hyperkalemia (see  PRECAUTIONS  ), hyponatremia.



     Creatinine and Blood Urea Nitrogen  



 As with other ACE inhibitors, minor increases in blood urea nitrogen or serum creatinine, reversible upon discontinuation of therapy, were observed in approximately 1% of patients with essential hypertension who were treated with univasc  (r)  . Increases are more likely to occur in patients receiving concomitant diuretics and in patients with compromised renal function (see  PRECAUTIONS, General  ).



     Other (causal relationship unknown)  



 Clinically important changes in standard laboratory tests were rarely associated with univasc  (r)  administration.



 Elevations of liver enzymes and uric acid have been reported. In trials, less than 1% of moexipril-treated patients discontinued univasc  (r)  treatment because of laboratory abnormalities. The incidence of abnormal laboratory values with moexipril was similar to that in the placebo-treated group.

   General



   



   Impaired Renal Function  



 As a consequence of inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. There is no clinical experience of univasc  (r)  in the treatment of hypertension in patients with renal failure.



 Some hypertensive patients with no apparent preexisting renal vascular disease have developed increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, usually minor and transient, especially when univasc  (r)  has been given concomitantly with a thiazide diuretic. This is more likely to occur in patients with preexisting renal impairment. There may be a need for dose adjustment of univasc  (r)  and/or the discontinuation of the thiazide diuretic.



  Evaluation of hypertensive patients should always include assessment of renal function  (see  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  ).



    Hypertensive Patients With Congestive Heart Failure  



 In hypertensive patients with severe congestive heart failure, whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with ACE inhibitors, including univasc  (r)  , may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and, rarely, acute renal failure and/or death.



    Hypertensive Patients With Renal Artery Stenosis  



 In hypertensive patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine have been observed in some patients following ACE inhibitor therapy. These increases were almost always reversible upon discontinuation of the ACE inhibitor and/or diuretic therapy. In such patients, renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of therapy.



    Hyperkalemia  



 In clinical trials, persistent hyperkalemia (serum potassium above 5.4 mEq/L) occurred in approximately 1.3% of hypertensive patients receiving univasc  (r)  . Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia with ACE inhibitors include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, and/or potassium-containing salt substitutes, which should be used cautiously, if at all, with univasc  (r)  (see  PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions  ).



    Surgery/Anesthesia  



 In patients undergoing major surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, moexipril may block the effects of compensatory renin release. If hypotension occurs in this setting and is considered to be due to this mechanism, it can be corrected by volume expansion.



    Cough  



 Presumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, always resolving after discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough. In controlled trials with moexipril, cough was present in 6.1% of moexipril patients and 2.2% of patients given placebo.



    Information for Patients



   Food  



 Patients should be advised to take moexipril one hour before meals (see  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  and  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  ).



    Angioedema  



 Angioedema, including laryngeal edema, may occur with treatment with ACE inhibitors, usually occurring early in therapy (within the first month). Patients should be so advised and told to report immediately any signs or symptoms suggesting angioedema (swelling of the face, extremities, eyes, lips, tongue, difficulty in breathing) and to take no more univasc  (r)  until they have consulted with the prescribing physician.



    Symptomatic Hypotension  



 Patients should be cautioned that lightheadedness can occur with univasc  (r)  , especially during the first few days of therapy. If fainting occurs, the patient should stop taking univasc  (r)  and consult the prescribing physician.



 All patients should be cautioned that excessive perspiration and dehydration may lead to an excessive fall in blood pressure because of reduction in fluid volume. Other causes of volume depletion such as vomiting or diarrhea may also lead to a fall in blood pressure; patients should be advised to consult their physician if they develop these conditions.



    Hyperkalemia  



 Patients should be told not to use potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium without consulting their physician.



    Neutropenia  



 Patients should be told to report promptly any indication of infection (e.g., sore throat, fever) that could be a sign of neutropenia.



    Pregnancy  



 Female patients of childbearing age should be told about the consequences of exposure to univasc  (r)  during pregnancy. Discuss treatment options with women planning to become pregnant. Patients should be asked to report pregnancies to their physicians as soon as possible.



    Drug Interactions



   Diuretics  



 Excessive reductions in blood pressure may occur in patients on diuretic therapy when ACE inhibitors are started. The possibility of hypotensive effects with univasc  (r)  can be minimized by discontinuing diuretic therapy for several days or cautiously increasing salt intake before initiation of treatment with univasc  (r)  . If this is not possible, the starting dose of moexipril should be reduced. (See  WARNINGS  and  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  ).



    Potassium Supplements and Potassium-Sparing Diuretics  



 univasc  (r)  can increase serum potassium because it decreases aldosterone secretion. Use of potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, triamterene, amiloride) or potassium supplements concomitantly with ACE inhibitors can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Therefore, if concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be given with caution and the patient's serum potassium should be monitored.



    Oral Anticoagulants  



 Interaction studies with warfarin failed to identify any clinically important effect on the serum concentrations of the anticoagulant or on its anticoagulant effect.



    Lithium  



 Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. These drugs should be coadministered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. If a diuretic is also used, the risk of lithium toxicity may be increased.



    Gold  



 Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy including univasc  (r)  .



    Non-steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors)  



 In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDS, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including moexipril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving moexipril and NSAID therapy.



 The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including moexipril, may be attenuated by NSAIDS.



    Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS)  



 Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on univasc  (r)  and other agents that affect the RAS.



 Do not co-administer aliskiren with univasc  (r)  in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with univasc  (r)  in patients with renal impairment (GFR &lt;60 mL/min).



    Other Agents  



 No clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions occurred when univasc  (r)  was administered concomitantly with hydrochlorothiazide, digoxin, or cimetidine.



 univasc  (r)  has been used in clinical trials concomitantly with calcium-channel-blocking agents, diuretics, H2blockers, digoxin, oral hypoglycemic agents, and cholesterol-lowering agents. There was no evidence of clinically important adverse interactions.



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility



  No evidence of carcinogenicity was detected in long-term studies in mice and rats at doses up to 14 or 27.3 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) on a mg/m  2  basis.



 No mutagenicity was detected in the Ames test and microbial reverse mutation assay, with and without metabolic activation, or in an in vivo  nucleus anomaly test. However, increased chromosomal aberration frequency in Chinese hamster ovary cells was detected under metabolic activation conditions at a 20-hour harvest time.



 Reproduction studies have been performed in rabbits at oral doses up to 0.7 times the MRHD on a mg/m  2  basis, and in rats up to 90.9 times the MRHD on a mg/m  2  basis. No indication of impaired fertility, reproductive toxicity, or teratogenicity was observed.



    Nursing Mothers



  It is not known whether univasc  (r)  is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when univasc  (r)  is given to a nursing mother.



    Pediatric Use



    Neonates with a history of in utero  exposure to univasc  (r)    



  If oliguria or hypotension occurs, direct attention toward support of blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal function.



   Safety and effectiveness of univasc  (r)  in pediatric patients have not been established.



    Geriatric Use



  Clinical studies of univasc  (r)  did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

    <Section id="S4" name="warnings">    WARNINGS



   Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions



  Presumably because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors affect the metabolism of eicosanoids and polypeptides, including endogenous bradykinin, patients receiving ACE inhibitors, including univasc  (r)  , may be subject to a variety of adverse reactions, some of them serious.



    Head and Neck Angioedema



  Angioedema involving the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis, and/or larynx has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors, including univasc  (r)  . Symptoms suggestive of angioedema or facial edema occurred in &lt;0.5% of moexipril-treated patients in placebo-controlled trials. None of the cases were considered life-threatening and all resolved either without treatment or with medication (antihistamines or glucocorticoids). One patient treated with hydrochlorothiazide alone experienced laryngeal edema. No instances of angioedema were reported in placebo-treated patients.



 In cases of angioedema, treatment should be promptly discontinued and the patient carefully observed until the swelling disappears. In instances where swelling has been confined to the face and lips, the condition has generally resolved without treatment, although antihistamines have been useful in relieving symptoms.



  Angioedema associated with involvement of the tongue, glottis, or larynx, may be fatal due to airway obstruction. Appropriate therapy, e.g., subcutaneous epinephrine solution 1:1000 (0.3 to 0.5 mL) and/or measures to ensure a patent airway, should be promptly provided  (see  ADVERSE REACTIONS  ).



    Intestinal Angioedema



  Intestinal angioedema has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. These patients presented with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vomiting); in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C-1 esterase levels were normal. The angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angioedema should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain.



    Anaphylactoid Reactions During Desensitization



  Two patients undergoing desensitizing treatment with hymenoptera venom while receiving ACE inhibitors sustained life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions. In the same patients, these reactions did not occur when ACE inhibitors were temporarily withheld, but they reappeared when the ACE inhibitors were inadvertently readministered.



    Anaphylactoid Reactions During Membrane Exposure



  Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in patients dialyzed with high-flux membranes and treated concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor. Anaphylactoid reactions have also been reported in patients undergoing low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate absorption.



    Hypotension



  univasc  (r)  can cause symptomatic hypotension, although, as with other ACE inhibitors, this is unusual in uncomplicated hypertensive patients treated with univasc  (r)  alone. Symptomatic hypotension was seen in 0.5% of patients given moexipril and led to discontinuation of therapy in about 0.25%. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been salt- and volume-depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, or vomiting. Volume- and salt-depletion should be corrected and, in general, diuretics stopped, before initiating therapy with univasc  (r)  (see  PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions  , and  ADVERSE REACTIONS  ).



 In patients with congestive heart failure, with or without associated renal insufficiency, ACE inhibitor therapy may cause excessive hypotension, which may be associated with oliguria or progressive azotemia, and rarely, with acute renal failure and death. In these patients, univasc  (r)  therapy should be started under close medical supervision, and patients should be followed closely for the first two weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of moexipril or an accompanying diuretic is increased. Care in avoiding hypotension should also be taken in patients with ischemic heart disease, aortic stenosis, or cerebrovascular disease, in whom an excessive decrease in blood pressure could result in a myocardial infarction or a cerebrovascular accident.



 If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position and, if necessary, treated with an intravenous infusion of normal saline. univasc  (r)  treatment usually can be continued following restoration of blood pressure and volume.



    Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis



  Another ACE inhibitor, captopril, has been shown to cause agranulocytosis and bone marrow depression, rarely in patients with uncomplicated hypertension, but more frequently in hypertensive patients with renal impairment, especially if they also have a collagen-vascular disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus or scleroderma. Although there were no instances of severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count &lt;500/mm  3  ) among patients given univasc  (r)  , as with other ACE inhibitors, monitoring of white blood cell counts should be considered for patients who have collagen-vascular disease, especially if the disease is associated with impaired renal function. Available data from clinical trials of univasc  (r)  are insufficient to show that univasc  (r)  does not cause agranulocytosis at rates similar to captopril.



    Fetal Toxicity



   Pregnancy Category D  



 Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue univasc  (r)  as soon as possible. These adverse outcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. Appropriate management of maternal hypertension during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus.



 In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. If oligohydramnios is observed, discontinue univasc  (r)  , unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. Closely observe infants with histories of in utero  exposure to univasc  (r)  for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia. (see  Precautions, Pediatric Use  ).



 No embryotoxic, fetotoxic, or teratogenic effects were seen in rats or in rabbits treated with up to 90.9 and 0.7 times, respectively, the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) on a mg/m  2  basis.



    Hepatic Failure



  Rarely, ACE inhibitors have been associated with a syndrome that starts with cholestatic jaundice and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis and sometimes death. The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood. Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical follow-up.
