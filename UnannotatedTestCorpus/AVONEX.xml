  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of AVONEX cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of other drugs and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

 Among 351 patients with relapsing forms of MS treated with AVONEX 30 micrograms (including 319 patients treated for 6 months and 288 patients treated for greater than one year) the most commonly reported adverse reactions (at least 5% more frequent on AVONEX than on placebo) were flu-like symptoms. Symptoms can include chills, fever, myalgia and asthenia occurring within hours to days following an injection. Most people who take AVONEX have flu-like symptoms early during the course of therapy. Usually, these symptoms last for a day after the injection. For many people, these symptoms lessen or go away over time. The most frequently reported adverse reactions resulting in clinical intervention (for example, discontinuation of AVONEX or the need for concomitant medication to treat an adverse reaction symptom) were flu-like symptoms and depression.

   Table 2  enumerates adverse reactions that occurred with AVONEX-treated patients at an incidence of at least 2% more than that observed in the placebo-treated patients in the pooled placebo-controlled studies in patients with relapsing forms of MS [see  Clinical Studies (  14  )  ].

             Immunogenicity  
 

 Anaphylaxis and other allergic reactions have occurred in AVONEX-treated patients [see  Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  )  ]. As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. In studies assessing immunogenicity in multiple sclerosis patients administered AVONEX for at least 1 year, 5% (21 of 390 patients) showed the presence of neutralizing antibodies at one or more times.

 These data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were considered positive for antibodies to AVONEX using a two-tiered assay (ELISA binding assay followed by an antiviral cytopathic effect assay), and are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of neutralizing activity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to AVONEX with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.

   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of AVONEX. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

 *  Menorrhagia and metrorrhagia 
 *  Rash (including vesicular rash) 
 *  Rare cases of injection site abscess or cellulitis requiring surgical intervention

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">   5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

   EXCERPT:    *  Depression, Suicide, and Psychotic Disorders: advise patients to immediately report any symptoms of depression, suicidal ideation, and/or psychosis; consider discontinuation of AVONEX if depression occurs (  5.1  ) 
 *  Hepatic Injury: monitor liver function tests; monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hepatic injury; consider discontinuation of AVONEX if hepatic injury occurs (  5.2  ,  5.9  ) 
 *  Anaphylaxis and Other Allergic-Reactions: Discontinue if occurs (  5.3  ) 
 *  Congestive Heart Failure: monitor patients with pre-existing significant cardiac disease for worsening of cardiac symptoms (  5.4  ) 
 *  Decreased Peripheral Blood Counts: monitor complete blood count (  5.5  ,  5.9  ) 
 *  Thrombotic Microangiopathy: Cases of thrombotic microangiopathy have been reported. Discontinue AVONEX if clinical symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with TMA occur (  5.6  ) 
 *  Autoimmune Disorders: consider discontinuation of AVONEX if new autoimmune disorder occurs (  5.8  ,  5.9  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Depression, Suicide, and Psychotic Disorders

  Patients treated with AVONEX and their caregivers should be advised to report immediately any symptoms of depression, suicidal ideation, and/or psychosis to their prescribing physicians. If a patient develops depression or other severe psychiatric symptoms, cessation of AVONEX therapy should be considered.

 Depression and suicide have been reported to occur with increased frequency in patients receiving AVONEX. In Study 1, the incidence of depression was similar in placebo-treated and in AVONEX-treated patients, but suicidal tendency was seen more frequently in AVONEX-treated patients (4% in AVONEX group vs. 1% in placebo group). In Study 2, there was a greater incidence of depression in AVONEX-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients (20% in AVONEX group vs. 13% in placebo group) [see Clinical Studies (  14  )  ].

 Additionally, there have been postmarketing reports of depression, suicidal ideation, and/or development of new or worsening of other pre-existing psychiatric disorders, including psychosis. For some of these patients, symptoms of depression improved upon cessation of AVONEX.

    5.2 Hepatic Injury

  Severe hepatic injury, including cases of hepatic failure, has been reported rarely in patients taking AVONEX. Asymptomatic elevation of hepatic transaminases has also been reported, and in some patients has recurred upon rechallenge with AVONEX. In some cases, these events have occurred in the presence of other drugs that have been associated with hepatic injury. The potential risk of AVONEX used in combination with known hepatotoxic drugs or other products (e.g., alcohol) should be considered prior to starting AVONEX, or before starting hepatotoxic drugs. Patients should be monitored for signs of hepatic injury [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.9  )  ].

    5.3 Anaphylaxis and Other Allergic-Reactions

  Anaphylaxis has been reported as a rare complication of AVONEX use. Other allergic reactions have included dyspnea, orolingual edema, skin rash and urticaria. Discontinue AVONEX if anaphylaxis or other allergic reactions occur.

    5.4 Congestive Heart Failure

  Patients with pre-existing congestive heart failure should be monitored for worsening of their cardiac condition during initiation of and continued treatment with AVONEX. While beta interferons do not have any known direct cardiac toxicity, during the postmarketing period cases of congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiomyopathy with congestive heart failure have been reported in patients without known predisposition to these events, and without other etiologies being established. In some cases, these events have been temporally related to the administration of AVONEX. In some of these instances recurrence upon rechallenge was observed.

    5.5 Decreased Peripheral Blood Counts

  Decreased peripheral blood counts in all cell lines, including rare pancytopenia and thrombocytopenia, have been reported from postmarketing experience in AVONEX-treated patients [see Adverse Reactions (  6.2  )  ]. In some cases, platelet counts were below 10,000/microliter. Some cases recurred with rechallenge [see Adverse Reactions (  6.2  )  ]. Patients should be monitored for symptoms or signs of decreased blood counts.

    5.6 Thrombotic Microangiopathy

  Cases of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic uremic syndrome, some fatal, have been reported with interferon beta products, including AVONEX. Cases have been reported several weeks to years after starting interferon beta products. Discontinue AVONEX if clinical symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with TMA occur, and manage as clinically indicated.

    5.7 Seizures

  Seizures have been temporally associated with the use of beta interferons in clinical trials and postmarketing safety surveillance. In the two placebo-controlled studies in multiple sclerosis (Studies 1 and 2), 4 patients receiving AVONEX experienced seizures, while no seizures occurred in the placebo group [see Clinical Studies (  14  )  ]. Three of these 4 patients had no prior history of seizure [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )  ]. It is not known whether these events were related to the effects of multiple sclerosis alone, to AVONEX, or to a combination of both.

    5.8 Autoimmune Disorders

  Postmarketing reports of autoimmune disorders of multiple target organs in AVONEX-treated patients included idiopathic thrombocytopenia, hyper- and hypothyroidism, and rare cases of autoimmune hepatitis. If AVONEX-treated patients develop a new autoimmune disorder, consider stopping the therapy.

    5.9 Laboratory Tests

  In addition to those laboratory tests normally required for monitoring patients with multiple sclerosis, complete blood and differential white blood cell counts, platelet counts, and blood chemistries, including liver function tests, are recommended during AVONEX therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  ,  5.5  ,  5.8  )  ]. Patients with myelosuppression may require more intensive monitoring of complete blood cell counts, with differential and platelet counts. Thyroid function should be monitored periodically. If patients have or develop symptoms of thyroid dysfunction (hypo- or hyperthyroidism), thyroid function tests should be performed according to standard medical practice.
