  The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label:



 *    Serious Allergic Reactions, Including Anaphylaxis [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  
 *    Prolonged and Severe Cytopenias [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]  
 *    Secondary malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]  
 *    Hypothyroidism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]  
    The most common adverse reactions in patients receiving the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen (per-patient incidence greater than 25%) were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, infections (including pneumonia, bacteremia, septicemia, bronchitis, and skin infections), infusion reactions, asthenia, fever, and nausea  [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)]  .
 

 The most common serious adverse reactions in patients receiving the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen were severe and prolonged cytopenias, infections (including pneumonia, bacteremia, septicemia, bronchitis, and skin infections), serious allergic reactions (including bronchospasm and angioedema), infusion reactions, and secondary leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome  [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.4)]  .



   EXCERPT:   The most common adverse reactions (&gt;=25%) are neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, infections, infusion reactions, asthenia, fever, and nausea. (6)

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 The reported safety data reflects exposure to the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen in 230 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma enrolled in 5 clinical trials using the recommended dose and schedule. Patients were followed for a median of 39 months; 79% were followed for at least 12 months for survival and selected adverse reactions. Patients had a median of 3 prior chemotherapy regimens, a median age of 55 years, and 60% were male. Twenty-seven percent (27%) had transformation to a higher grade histology; 29% had intermediate-grade histology, and 2% had high-grade histology (IWF); 68% had Ann Arbor stage IV disease. Patients enrolled in these studies were not permitted to have prior hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or irradiation to more than 25% of the marrow space.



 Data on serious adverse reactions and human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) and TSH levels were obtained from an additional 765 patients enrolled in the expanded access program and used to supplement the characterization of delayed adverse reactions. Patients in the expanded access program had fewer prior chemotherapy regimens (2 versus 3) and a higher proportion had low-grade histology (77% versus 70%) compared to patients in clinical trials.

   c  Grade 4 toxicity was assumed if patient had documented Grade 3 toxicity and was missing 2 or more weeks of hematology data between Week 5 and Week 9.



   Prolonged and Severe Cytopenias  : The incidence and duration of severe cytopenias are shown in Table 3. Sixty-three (27%) patients received one or more hematologic supportive care measures following the therapeutic dose including G-CSF, epoetin alfa, platelet transfusions, and packed red blood cell transfusions. Twenty-eight (12%) patients experienced hemorrhagic adverse reactions.



   Infections  : One hundred and four patients (45%) patients experienced one or more infections. Twenty (9%) experienced serious infections including pneumonia, bacteremia, septicemia, bronchitis, and skin infections.



   Allergic (Hypersensitivity) Reactions  : Fourteen patients (6%) experienced one or more of the following adverse reactions: allergic reaction, facial edema, injection site hypersensitivity, anaphylactic reaction, laryngismus, and serum sickness.



   Infusion-related Adverse Reactions  : Infusion reactions including fever, rigors or chills, sweating, hypotension, dyspnea, bronchospasm, and nausea occurred during or within 48 hours of infusion. Sixty-seven patients (29%) experienced fever, rigors/chills, or sweating within 14 days following the dosimetric dose. All patients in the clinical studies received pretreatment with acetaminophen and an antihistamine.



   Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)/Secondary Leukemia  : The incidence of MDS/secondary leukemia among the 230 patients included in the clinical studies was 10% (24/230), with a median follow-up of 39 months and a median time to development of 34 months. The cumulative incidence of MDS/secondary leukemia was 4.7% at 2 years and 15% at 5 years. The incidence of MDS/secondary leukemia among the 765 patients in the expanded access program was 3% (20/765), with a median follow-up of 27 months and a median time to development of 31 months. The cumulative incidence of MDS/secondary leukemia in this patient population was 1.6% at 2 years and 6% at 5 years.



   Secondary Malignancies  : Of the 995 patients in clinical studies and the expanded access programs, there were 65 secondary malignancies reported in 54 patients (5%) in clinical studies and the expanded access program. These included non-melanoma skin cancers (26), colorectal cancer (7), head and neck cancer (6), breast cancer (5), lung cancer (4), bladder cancer (4), melanoma (3), and gastric cancer (2).



   Hypothyroidism  : Of the 230 patients in the clinical studies, 203 patients did not have elevated TSH at study entry. Of these, 137 patients had at least one post-treatment TSH value available and were not taking thyroid hormonal treatment at study entry. With a median follow-up period of 46 months, the incidence of hypothyroidism (elevated TSH or initiation of thyroid replacement therapy) was 18% with a median time to development of 16 months. The cumulative incidences of hypothyroidism at 2 and 5 years in these 137 patients were 11% and 19%, respectively. Onset of hypothyroidism has occurred up to 90 months post-treatment. The cumulative incidence and median time to development of hypothyroidism were similar in the expanded access program.



   6.2 Immunogenicity

  There is a potential for immunogenicity with therapeutic proteins such as tositumomab. Serum samples from 989 chemotherapy-relapsed or refractory patients included in the clinical studies or the expanded access program were tested by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that detects antibodies to the Fc portion of IgG1murine immunoglobulin. One percent of the patients (11/989) had a positive serology for HAMA prior to treatment. The post-treatment incidence of HAMA seropositivity is summarized in Table 4.



 Table 4. Incidence of HAMA Seropositivity Among Patients With Chemotherapy-refractory or Relapsed Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma Receiving the BEXXAR Therapeutic Regimen 
  Chemotherapy-refractory or relapsed patients      Percent  HAMA positive    Kaplan-Meier estimate of HAMA positivity

  In clinical trials                                23/219 (11%)        6%              17%               21%               
  In expanded-access program                        57/569 (10%)        7%              12%               13%               
           In a study of 76 previously untreated patients with low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who received the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen, the incidence of conversion to HAMA seropositivity was 70%, with a median time to development of 27 days.
 

 Immunogenicity assay results are highly dependent on several factors including assay sensitivity and specificity, assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of incidence of antibodies to BEXXAR with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.



   6.3 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions including fatal anaphylaxis.



 Nervous system disorders: Axonal neuropathy leading to quadriparesis.

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *    Secondary Malignancies: Hematological and non-hematological secondary malignancies have been reported. (5.4) 
 *    Hypothyroidism: Thyroid-blocking medication is required prior to administration of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen. Evaluate for clinical evidence of hypothyroidism and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level before treatment and annually thereafter. (5.5) 
 *    Embryo-fetal Toxicity: Administration to a pregnant woman can cause embryo-fetal harm including severe, and possibly irreversible, neonatal hypothyroidism. Females and males of reproductive potential should use effective contraception to avoid pregnancy during treatment and for 12 months after the therapeutic dose. (5.6, 8.1, 8.7) 
    
 

   5.1 Serious Allergic Reactions, Including Anaphylaxis



  The BEXXAR therapeutic regimen can cause severe, including fatal, allergic reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and (6.3)].  Premedicate with acetaminophen and diphenhydramine [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), (2.4), and (2.8)]  . Have medications for the treatment of allergic reactions available for immediate use during administration. Signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions may include fever, rigors or chills, sweating, hypotension, dyspnea, bronchospasm, and nausea during or within 48 hours of infusion. Immediately interrupt BEXXAR infusions for severe reactions and provide appropriate medical and supportive care measures. Permanently, discontinue the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen in patients who develop serious allergic reactions.



    5.2 Prolonged and Severe Cytopenias



  Patients receiving the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen experienced severe (NCI CTC grade 3-4) and prolonged neutropenia (63%), thrombocytopenia (53%), and anemia (29%) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]  . The time to nadir was 4 to 7 weeks and the duration of cytopenias was approximately 30 days. Due to the variable nature of the onset of cytopenias, monitor patients with weekly complete blood counts for up to 12 weeks.



 The BEXXAR therapeutic regimen should not be administered to patients with &gt;25% lymphoma marrow involvement, platelet count &lt;100,000 cells/mm  3  , or neutrophil count &lt;1,500 cells/mm  3  .



    5.3 Radiation Exposure



  The BEXXAR therapeutic regimen contains Iodine-131. Follow institutional radiation safety practices and applicable federal guidelines to minimize radiation exposure during handling and after administration of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen. Advise patients of the risks of radiation exposure of household contacts, pregnant women, and small children and of the steps to be taken to reduce these risks.



 The BEXXAR therapeutic regimen should be administered only by physicians enrolled in the certification program for dose calculation and administration of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen. Further information regarding the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen certification program is available by phone at 1-877-423-9927.



    5.4 Secondary Malignancies



  Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute leukemia may occur with the use of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen and were reported in 10% of patients enrolled in clinical trials and 3% of patients enrolled in the expanded access program (median follow-up of 39 and 27 months, respectively). The median time to development of MDS or leukemia was 31 months [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]  .



 Non-hematologic malignancies may occur with the use of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen and were reported in 5% of patients enrolled in clinical trials or the expanded access program. In the absence of controlled studies, the relative risk of secondary malignancies in patients receiving the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen cannot be determined [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]  .



    5.5 Hypothyroidism



  The BEXXAR therapeutic regimen can cause hypothyroidism [see Adverse Reactions (6.1  ) ]  . Initiate thyroid-blocking medications at least 24 hours before administering the dosimetric dose and continue until 14 days after the therapeutic dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]  . The risk of hypothyroidism is likely to be increased in patients who do not complete the recommended thyroid-protective regimen. Evaluate for clinical evidence of hypothyroidism and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level before treatment and annually thereafter.



    5.6 Embryo-fetal Toxicity



  The BEXXAR therapeutic regimen can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman including severe, and possibly irreversible, neonatal hypothyroidism. Inform patients who are pregnant or become pregnant after the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen about the potential hazard to a fetus. Evaluate infants born to mothers treated with the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen during pregnancy for hypothyroidism at time of delivery and during the neonatal period [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]  .



 Males and females of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during treatment with the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen and for 12 months after the therapeutic dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]  .



    5.7 Excessive Radiation Exposure in Patients With Impaired Renal Function



  There are no data regarding the safety of administration of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen in patients with impaired renal function. Since the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen is primarily cleared through the kidneys, the rate of excretion of radiolabeled iodine is expected to be decreased in patients with impaired renal function or obstructive uropathy, which may result in increased patient exposure to I-131 tositumomab. [See Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3).]  



    5.8 Immunization



  The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines following administration of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen and the ability of patients who have received the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen to generate a primary or anamnestic humoral response to any vaccine have not been studied. Do not administer live viral vaccines to patients recently treated with BEXXAR.
