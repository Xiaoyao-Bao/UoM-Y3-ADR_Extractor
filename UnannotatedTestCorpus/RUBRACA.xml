 *  Most common laboratory abnormalities (&gt;= 25%) were increase in creatinine, increase in ALT, increase in AST, increase in alkaline phosphatase, decrease in hemoglobin, increase in cholesterol, decrease in platelets, decrease in leukocytes, decrease in lymphocytes, and decrease in neutrophils.

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     Maintenance Treatment of Recurrent Ovarian Cancer  



 The safety of Rubraca for the maintenance treatment of patients with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer was investigated in ARIEL3, a randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which 561 patients received either Rubraca 600 mg BID (n=372) or placebo (n=189) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median duration of study treatment was 8.3 months (range: &lt; 1 month to 35 months) for patients who received Rubraca and 5.5 months for patients who received placebo.



 Dose interruptions due to an adverse reaction of any grade occurred in 65% of patients receiving Rubraca and 10% of those receiving placebo; dose reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 55% of Rubraca patients and 4% of placebo patients. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to dose interruption or dose reduction of Rubraca were thrombocytopenia (18%), anemia (17%), nausea (15%), and fatigue/asthenia (13%). Discontinuation due to adverse reactions occurred in 15% of Rubraca patients and 2% of placebo patients. Specific adverse reactions that most frequently led to discontinuation in patients treated with Rubraca were anemia (3%), thrombocytopenia (3%) and nausea (3%).

               Treatment of BRCA-mutated Recurrent Ovarian Cancer After 2 or More Chemotherapies  
 

 Rubraca 600 mg twice daily as monotherapy has also been studied in 377 patients with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who have progressed after 2 or more prior chemotherapies in two open-label, single arm trials. In these patients, the median age was 62 years (range: 31 to 86), 100% had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, 38% had  BRCA  -mutated ovarian cancer, 45% had received 3 or more prior lines of chemotherapy, and the median time since ovarian cancer diagnosis was 43 months (range: 6 to 197).

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Myelodysplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia (MDS/AML): MDS/AML occurred in patients exposed to RUBRACA, and some cases were fatal. Monitor patients for hematological toxicity at baseline and monthly thereafter. Discontinue if MDS/AML is confirmed. (  5.1  ) 
 *  Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: RUBRACA can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. (  5.2  ,  8.1  ,  8.3  ) 
    
 

      5.1 Myelodysplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia



     Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)/Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) occur uncommonly in patients treated with Rubraca, and are potentially fatal adverse reactions. In approximately 1100 treated patients, MDS/AML occurred in 12 patients (1.1%), including those in long term follow-up. Of these, 5 occurred during treatment or during the 28 day safety follow-up (0.5%). The duration of Rubraca treatment prior to the diagnosis of MDS/AML ranged from 1 month to approximately 28 months. The cases were typical of secondary MDS/cancer therapy-related AML; in all cases, patients had received previous platinum-containing chemotherapy regimens and/or other DNA damaging agents.



    Do not start Rubraca until patients have recovered from hematological toxicity caused by previous chemotherapy (&lt;= Grade 1). Monitor complete blood counts for cytopenia at baseline and monthly thereafter for clinically significant changes during treatment. For prolonged hematological toxicities (&gt; 4 weeks), interrupt Rubraca or reduce dose according to  Table 1   [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  )]  and monitor blood counts weekly until recovery. If the levels have not recovered to Grade 1 or less after 4 weeks or if MDS/AML is suspected, refer the patient to a hematologist for further investigations, including bone marrow analysis and blood sample for cytogenetics. If MDS/AML is confirmed, discontinue Rubraca.



       5.2 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



     Rubraca can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies. In an animal reproduction study, administration of rucaparib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryo-fetal death at exposures that were 0.04 times the AUC0-24hin patients receiving the recommended human dose of 600 mg twice daily. Apprise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months following the last dose of Rubraca [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  ,  8.3  ) and Clinical Pharmacology (  12.1  )].
