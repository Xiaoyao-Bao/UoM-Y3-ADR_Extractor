  Observed in Clinical Trials

  MIVACRON (a mixture of three stereoisomers) was well tolerated during extensive clinical trials in inpatients and outpatients. Prolonged neuromuscular block, which is an important adverse experience associated with neuromuscular blocking agents as a class, was reported as an adverse experience in three of 2074 patients administered MIVACRON. The most commonly reported adverse experience following the administration of MIVACRON was transient, dose-dependent cutaneous flushing about the face, neck, and/or chest. Flushing was most frequently noted after the initial dose of MIVACRON and was reported in about 25% of adult patients who received 0.15 mg/kg MIVACRON over 5 to 15 seconds. When present, flushing typically began within 1 to 2 minutes after the dose of MIVACRON and lasted for 3 to 5 minutes. Of 105 patients who experienced flushing after 0.15 mg/kg MIVACRON, two patients also experienced mild hypotension that was not treated, and one patient experienced moderate wheezing that was successfully treated.



 Overall, hypotension was infrequently reported as an adverse experience in the clinical trials of MIVACRON. One of 332 (0.3%) healthy adults who received 0.15 mg/kg MIVACRON over 5 to 15 seconds and none of 37 cardiac surgery patients who received 0.15 mg/kg MIVACRON over 60 seconds were treated for a decrease in blood pressure in association with the administration of MIVACRON. One to two percent of healthy adults given greater than or equal to 0.2 mg/kg MIVACRON over 5 to 15 seconds, 2% to 3% of healthy adults given 0.2 mg/kg over 30 seconds, none of 100 healthy adults given 0.25 mg/kg as a divided dose (0.15 mg/kg followed in 30 seconds by 0.1 mg/kg), and 2% to 4% of cardiac surgery patients given greater than or equal to 0.2 mg/kg over 60 seconds were treated for a decrease in blood pressure. None of the 63 children who received the recommended dose of 0.2 mg/kg MIVACRON was treated for a decrease in blood pressure in association with the administration of MIVACRON.



 The following adverse experiences were reported in patients administered MIVACRON (all events judged by investigators during the clinical trials to have a possible causal relationship):



   

    Incidence Greater Than 1%  



   

      Cardiovascular    



 Flushing (16%)



   

    Incidence Less Than 1%  



   

      Cardiovascular    



 Hypotension, tachycardia, bradycardia, cardiac arrhythmia, phlebitis



   

      Respiratory    



 Bronchospasm, wheezing, hypoxemia



   

      Dermatological    



 Rash, urticaria, erythema, injection site reaction



   

      Nonspecific    



 Prolonged drug effect



   

      Neurologic    



 Dizziness



   

      Musculoskeletal    



 Muscle spasms



   Observed in Clinical Practice

  Based on initial clinical practice experience in patients who received MIVACRON, spontaneously reported adverse events are uncommon. Some of these events occurred at recommended doses and required treatment.



   Anaphylaxis/Anaphylactoid Reactions  : From post-marketing surveillance, MIVACRON has been associated with reports of anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions which in some cases have been life-threatening and fatal. Because these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency (see    WARNINGS    and    PRECAUTIONS    ). In some of these reports, sensitivity to MIVACRON was confirmed using skin test procedures.



 Other adverse reaction data from clinical practice are insufficient to establish a causal relationship or to support an estimate of their incidence. These adverse events include:



   

    Musculoskeletal  



 Diminished drug effect, prolonged drug effect



   

    Cardiovascular  



 Hypotension (rarely severe), flushing



   

    Respiratory  



 Bronchospasm



   

    Integumentary  



 Rash

   General



  Although MIVACRON (a mixture of three stereoisomers) is not a potent histamine releaser, the possibility of substantial histamine release must be considered. Release of histamine is related to the dose and speed of injection.



 Caution should be exercised in administering MIVACRON to patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease and patients with any history suggesting a greater sensitivity to the release of histamine or related mediators (e.g., asthma). In such patients, the initial dose of MIVACRON should be 0.15 mg/kg or less, administered over 60 seconds; assurance of adequate hydration and careful monitoring of hemodynamic status are important (see   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY - Hemodynamics    and   Individualization of Dosages    ).



 Obese patients may be more likely to experience clinically significant transient decreases in MAP than non-obese patients when the dose of MIVACRON is based on actual rather than ideal body weight. Therefore, in obese patients, the initial dose should be determined using the patient's ideal body weight (see   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY - Hemodynamics    and   Individualization of Dosages    ).



 Recommended doses of MIVACRON have no clinically significant effects on heart rate; therefore, MIVACRON will not counteract the bradycardia produced by many anesthetic agents or by vagal stimulation.



 Neuromuscular blocking agents may have a profound effect in patients with neuromuscular diseases (e.g., myasthenia gravis and the myasthenic syndrome). In these and other conditions in which prolonged neuromuscular block is a possibility (e.g., carcinomatosis), the use of a peripheral nerve stimulator and a dose of not more than 0.015 to 0.02 mg/kg MIVACRON is recommended to assess the level of neuromuscular block and to monitor dosage requirements (see   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY - Individualization of Dosages    ).



 MIVACRON has not been studied in patients with burns. Resistance to nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents may develop in patients with burns, depending upon the time elapsed since the injury and the size of the burn. Patients with burns may have reduced plasma cholinesterase activity which may offset this resistance (see   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY - Individualization of Dosages    ).



 Acid-base and/or serum electrolyte abnormalities may potentiate or antagonize the action of neuromuscular blocking agents. The action of neuromuscular blocking agents may be enhanced by magnesium salts administered for the management of toxemia of pregnancy (see   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY - Individualization of Dosages    ).



 No data are available to support the use of MIVACRON by intramuscular injection.



    Allergic Reactions



  Since allergic cross-reactivity has been reported in this class, request information from your patients about previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents. In addition, inform your patients that severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including MIVACRON have been reported (see   CONTRAINDICATIONS    ).



    Renal and Hepatic Disease



  The possibility of prolonged neuromuscular block must be considered when MIVACRON is used in patients with renal or hepatic disease (see   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY - Pharmacokinetics    ). Most patients with chronic hepatic disease such as hepatitis, liver abscess, and cirrhosis of the liver exhibit a marked reduction in plasma cholinesterase activity. Patients with acute or chronic renal disease may also show a reduction in plasma cholinesterase activity (see   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY - Individualization of Dosages    ).



    Reduced Plasma Cholinesterase Activity



  The possibility of prolonged neuromuscular block following administration of MIVACRON must be considered in patients with reduced plasma cholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase) activity.



 Plasma cholinesterase activity may be diminished in the presence of genetic abnormalities of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., patients heterozygous or homozygous for the atypical plasma cholinesterase gene), pregnancy, liver or kidney disease, malignant tumors, infections, burns, anemia, decompensated heart disease, peptic ulcer, or myxedema. Plasma cholinesterase activity may also be diminished by chronic administration of oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors and by irreversible inhibitors of plasma cholinesterase (e.g., organophosphate insecticides, echothiophate, and certain antineoplastic drugs).



 MIVACRON has been used safely in patients heterozygous for the atypical plasma cholinesterase gene. At doses of 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg MIVACRON, the clinically effective duration of action was 8 minutes to 11 minutes longer in patients heterozygous for the atypical gene than in genotypically normal patients.



 As with succinylcholine, patients homozygous for the atypical plasma cholinesterase gene (one in 2500 patients) are extremely sensitive to the neuromuscular blocking effect of MIVACRON. In three such adult patients, a small dose of 0.03 mg/kg (approximately the ED10-20in genotypically normal patients) produced complete neuromuscular block for 26 to 128 minutes. Once spontaneous recovery had begun, neuromuscular block in these patients was antagonized with conventional doses of neostigmine. One adult patient, who was homozygous for the atypical plasma cholinesterase gene, received a dose of 0.18 mg/kg MIVACRON and exhibited complete neuromuscular block for about 4 hours. Response to post-tetanic stimulation was present after 4 hours, all four responses to train-of-four stimulation were present after 6 hours, and the patient was extubated after 8 hours. Reversal was not attempted in this patient.



    Malignant Hyperthermia (MH)



  In a study of MH-susceptible pigs, MIVACRON did not trigger MH. MIVACRON has not been studied in MH-susceptible patients. Because MH can develop in the absence of established triggering agents, the clinician should be prepared to recognize and treat MH in any patient undergoing general anesthesia.



    Long-Term Use in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)



  No data are available on the long-term use of MIVACRON in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation in the ICU.



    Drug Interactions



  Although MIVACRON (a mixture of three stereoisomers) has been administered safely following succinylcholine-facilitated tracheal intubation, the interaction between MIVACRON and succinylcholine has not been systematically studied. Prior administration of succinylcholine can potentiate the neuromuscular blocking effects of nondepolarizing agents. Evidence of spontaneous recovery from succinylcholine should be observed before the administration of MIVACRON.



 The use of MIVACRON before succinylcholine to attenuate some of the side effects of succinylcholine has not been studied.



 There are no clinical data on the use of MIVACRON with other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents.



 Isoflurane and enflurane (administered with nitrous oxide/oxygen to achieve 1.25 MAC) decrease the ED50of MIVACRON by as much as 25% (see   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY - Pharmacodynamics    and   Individualization of Dosages    ). These agents may also prolong the clinically effective duration of action and decrease the average infusion requirement of MIVACRON by as much as 35% to 40%. A greater potentiation of the neuromuscular blocking effects of MIVACRON may be expected with higher concentrations of enflurane or isoflurane. Halothane has little or no effect on the ED50, but may prolong the duration of action and decrease the average infusion requirement by as much as 20%.



 Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as MIVACRON include certain antibiotics (e.g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistimethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine. The neuromuscular blocking effect of MIVACRON may be enhanced by drugs that reduce plasma cholinesterase activity (e.g., chronically administered oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors) or by drugs that irreversibly inhibit plasma cholinesterase (see   PRECAUTIONS - Reduced Plasma Cholinesterase Activity    subsection).



 Resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has been demonstrated in patients chronically administered phenytoin or carbamazepine. While the effects of chronic phenytoin or carbamazepine therapy on the action of MIVACRON are unknown, slightly shorter durations of neuromuscular block may be anticipated and infusion rate requirements may be higher.



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility



   Carcinogenesis  



 Long-term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential of mivacurium have not been completed.



  Mutagenesis  



 Mivacurium was non-mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames assay), the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay, the in vitro human lymphocyte assay, and the in vivo  rat bone marrow cytogenetic assay.



  Impairment of Fertility  



 Studies to evaluation the effects of mivacurium on fertility have not been completed.



    Pregnancy



   Risk Summary



  There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of MIVACRON in pregnant women. In animal studies, subcutaneous administration of mivacurium to pregnant rats and mice during organogenesis at doses 0.16 and 0.52 times the human dose of 0.25 mg/kg did not result in any malformations or embryo toxic effects (see   Data    ).



 The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.



    Data



    Animal Data    



 There was no evidence of malformations or embryo toxicity when pregnant mice were administered 0.25 or 0.5 mg/kg mivacurium during organogenesis (0.08 and 0.16 times the human dose of 0.25 mg/kg based on body surface area). These doses were not associated with maternal toxicity.



 There was no evidence of malformations or embryo toxicity when pregnant rats were administered 0.4 or 0.8 mg/kg mivacurium during organogenesis (0.26 and 0.52 times the human dose of 0.25 mg/kg based on body surface area). These doses were not associated with maternal toxicity.



    Labor and Delivery



  The use of MIVACRON during labor, vaginal delivery, or Cesarean section has not been studied in humans and it is not known whether MIVACRON administered to the mother has effects on the fetus. Doses of 0.08 and 0.2 mg/kg MIVACRON given to female beagles undergoing Cesarean section resulted in negligible levels of the stereoisomers in MIVACRON in umbilical vessel blood of neonates and no deleterious effects on the puppies.



    Nursing Mothers



  It is not known whether any of the stereoisomers of mivacurium are excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised following administration of MIVACRON to a nursing woman.



    Pediatric Use



  MIVACRON has not been studied in pediatric patients below the age of 2 years (see   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY    and   DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION    for clinical experience and recommendations for use in children 2 to 12 years of age).



    Geriatric Use



  MIVACRON was safely administered during clinical trials to 64 geriatric (greater than or equal to 65 years) patients, including 31 patients with significant cardiovascular disease (see   PRECAUTIONS - General    subsection). In general, the clearances of MIVACRON are most likely lower, the duration may be longer, the rate of recovery may be slower, therefore, MIVACRON requirements may be lower in geriatric patients (see   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY - Special Populations - Geriatric Patients    ).

   Anaphylaxis



  Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including MIVACRON, have been reported. These reactions have in some cases been life-threatening and fatal. Due to the potential severity of these reactions, the necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment, should be taken. Precautions should also be taken in those individuals who have had previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents since cross-reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non-depolarizing, has been reported in this class of drugs.



    



   Risk of Death Due to Medication Errors  



 Administration of MIVACRON results in paralysis, which may lead to respiratory arrest and death; this progression may be more likely to occur in a patient for whom it is not intended. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. If another healthcare provider is administering the product, ensure that the intended dose is clearly labeled and communicated.



    Administration



   MIVACRON should be administered in carefully adjusted dosage by or under the supervision of experienced clinicians who are familiar with the drug's actions and the possible complications of its use. The drug should not be administered unless personnel and facilities for resuscitation and life support (tracheal intubation, artificial ventilation, oxygen therapy), and an antagonist of MIVACRON are immediately available. It is recommended that a peripheral nerve stimulator be used to measure neuromuscular function during the administration of MIVACRON in order to monitor drug effect, determine the need for additional drug, and confirm recovery from neuromuscular block.  



  MIVACRON has no known effect on consciousness, pain threshold, or cerebration. To avoid distress to the patient, neuromuscular block should not be induced before unconsciousness.  



  MIVACRON is metabolized by plasma cholinesterase and should be used with great caution, if at all, in patients known to be or suspected of being homozygous for the atypical plasma cholinesterase gene.  



 MIVACRON Injection is acidic (pH 3.5 to 5) and may not be compatible with alkaline solutions having a pH greater than 8.5 (e.g., barbiturate solutions).
