  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The following data on adverse reactions are based on the subcutaneous administration of ACTIMMUNE at a dose of 50 mcg/m  2  , three times weekly, in patients with CGD during a clinical trial in the United States and Europe.



 The most common adverse reactions observed in patients with CGD are shown in the following table:

         Similar safety data were observed in 34 patients with SMO.
 

 The clinical and laboratory toxicity associated with multiple dose studies of ACTIMMUNE is dose, route and schedule-dependent.



 The most common adverse reactions include constitutional symptoms such as fever, headache, chills, myalgia or fatigue which may decrease in severity as treatment continues.



       Less Common Adverse Reactions    



 The following adverse reactions are assessed as potentially related to ACTIMMUNE (interferon gamma-1b) therapy:



 Blood and Lymphatic System - neutropenia (reversible), febrile neutropenia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia.

 Musculoskeletal - back pain, clubbing, and muscle spasms.



 Nervous System - dizziness (excluding vertigo), gait disturbance, headache, Parkinsonian symptoms, convulsion/seizure (including grand mal convulsions), and transient ischemic attacks.



 Psychiatric - confusion, depression, disorientation, hallucinations, mental status changes, and mental status decreased.



 Pulmonary - tachypnea, bronchospasm, pulmonary edema, and interstitial pneumonitis.



 Renal - acute renal failure (which may be reversible) and proteinuria.



 Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders - atopic dermatitis, (exacerbation of) dermatomyositis, transient cutaneous rash, and urticaria.



 Vascular Disorder - deep venous thrombosis, hypotension, pulmonary embolism.



 Abnormal Laboratory Test Values: Elevations of ALT and AST have been observed  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.4)  ]  .



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of ACTIMMUNE. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



     Children with CGD less than 3 years of age:  



 Data on the safety and activity of ACTIMMUNE in 37 patients under the age of 3 years was pooled from four uncontrolled postmarketing studies. The rate of serious infections per patient-year in this uncontrolled group was similar to the rate observed in the ACTIMMUNE treatment groups in controlled trials. Developmental parameters (height, weight and endocrine maturation) for this uncontrolled group conformed to national normative scales before and during ACTIMMUNE therapy.



 In 6 of the 10 patients receiving ACTIMMUNE therapy before age one year 2-fold to 25-fold elevations from baseline of AST and/or ALT were observed. These elevations occurred as early as 7 days after starting treatment. Treatment with ACTIMMUNE was interrupted in all 6 of these patients and was restarted at a reduced dosage in 4. Liver transaminase values returned to baseline in all patients and transaminase elevation recurred in one patient upon ACTIMMUNE rechallenge. An 11-fold alkaline phosphatase elevation and hypokalemia in one patient and neutropenia (ANC = 525 cells/mm  3  ) in another patient resolved with interruption of ACTIMMUNE treatment and did not recur with rechallenge.



 In the postmarketing safety database clinically significant adverse reactions observed during ACTIMMUNE therapy in children under the age of three years (n=14) included: two cases of hepatomegaly, and one case each of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, granulomatous colitis, urticaria, and atopic dermatitis.



   6.3 Immunogenicity

  As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. In clinical trials, 8 out of 33 ACTIMMUNE-treated patients developed non-neutralizing antibodies to interferon gamma-1b. No neutralizing antibodies to ACTIMMUNE have been detected in patients. In a Phase 1 study, none of the 38 ACTIMMUNE-treated healthy volunteers developed non-neutralizing antibodies to interferon gamma-1b.



 The detection of antibody formation, including neutralizing antibody, in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to ACTIMMUNE with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *   Cardiovascular Disorders : Pre-existing cardiac conditions may be exacerbated. (  5.1  ) 
 *   Neurologic Disorders : Reduce dose or discontinue if decreased mental status, gait disturbance, dizziness occur. (  5.2  ) 
 *   Bone Marrow Toxicity : Monitor for neutropenia and thrombocytopenia particularly when administering ACTIMMUNE in combination with other potentially myelosuppressive agents. (  5.3  ) 
 *   Hepatic Toxicity : Reduce dose or discontinue to reverse severe elevations of aspartate transaminase (AST) and/or alanine transaminase (ALT); monitor liver function monthly in patients less than 1 year old. (  5.4  ) 
 *   Hypersensitivity Reactions: If serious hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue and institute appropriate medical therapy. (  5.5  ) 
 *   Renal Toxicity : Monitor renal function regularly when administering ACTIMMUNE to patients with severe renal insufficiency (  5.6  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Cardiovascular Disorders



  Acute and transient "flu-like" symptoms such as fever and chills induced by ACTIMMUNE at doses of 250 mcg/m  2  /day (greater than 10 times the weekly recommended dose) or higher may exacerbate pre-existing cardiac conditions. Patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions, including ischemia, congestive heart failure or arrhythmia on ACTIMMUNE should be monitored for signs/symptoms of exacerbation. Some of the "flu-like" symptoms may be minimized by bedtime administration of ACTIMMUNE. Acetaminophen may also be used to ameliorate these effects.



    5.2 Neurologic Disorders



  Decreased mental status, gait disturbance and dizziness have been observed, particularly in patients receiving ACTIMMUNE doses greater than 250 mcg/m  2  /day (greater than 10 times the weekly recommended dose). Most of these abnormalities were reversible within a few days upon dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy. Monitor patients when administering ACTIMMUNE to patients with seizure disorders or compromised central nervous system function.



    5.3 Bone Marrow Toxicity



  Reversible neutropenia and thrombocytopenia that can be severe and may be dose related have been observed during ACTIMMUNE therapy. Monitor neutrophil and platelet counts in patients with myelosuppression during treatment with ACTIMMUNE.



    5.4 Hepatic Toxicity



  Repeated administration of ACTIMMUNE to patients with advanced hepatic disease may result in accumulation of interferon gamma-1b. Frequent assessment of liver function in these patients is recommended.



 Elevations of aspartate transaminase (AST) and/or alanine transaminase (ALT) (up to 25-fold) have been observed during ACTIMMUNE therapy. The incidence appeared to be higher in patients less than 1 year of age compared to older children. The transaminase elevations were reversible with reduction in dosage or interruption of ACTIMMUNE treatment. Patients begun on ACTIMMUNE before age one year should receive monthly assessments of liver function. If severe hepatic enzyme elevations develop, ACTIMMUNE dosage should be modified [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .



    5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions



  Isolated cases of acute serious hypersensitivity reactions have been observed in patients receiving ACTIMMUNE. If such an acute reaction develops the drug should be discontinued immediately and appropriate medical therapy instituted. Transient cutaneous rashes have occurred in some patients following injection of ACTIMMUNE that have necessitated treatment interruption.



    5.6 Renal Toxicity



  Monitor renal function regularly when administering ACTIMMUNE in patients with severe renal insufficiency because the possibility exists that with repeated administration, accumulation of interferon gamma-1b may occur. Renal toxicity has been reported in patients receiving ACTIMMUNE.



    5.7 Allergic Reactions to Natural Rubber



  The stopper of the glass vial for ACTIMMUNE contains natural rubber (a derivative of latex) which may cause allergic reactions.
