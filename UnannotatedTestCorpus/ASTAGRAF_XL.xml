  6.1 Clinical Studies Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In addition, the clinical trials were not designed to establish comparative differences across study arms with regards to the adverse reactions discussed below.



 Kidney transplant patients were treated with ASTAGRAF XL (N=214) or tacrolimus immediate-release product (N=212) and concomitant immunosuppressants (median duration of exposure of 12 months) in a randomized, open-label, active-controlled trial of mostly U.S. patients (Study 1)  [see  Clinical Studies  (  14.1  )]  . The types of adverse reactions seen in Study 1 were similar to the adverse reactions seen in Study 2 [non-U.S. trial in kidney transplant patients treated with ASTAGRAF XL (N=331) or tacrolimus immediate-release product (N=336) and concomitant immunosuppressants]  [see  Clinical Studies  (  14.2  )]  .



 In Study 1, the proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions was 9% and 11% in the ASTAGRAF XL and tacrolimus immediate-release treatment groups, respectively, through 12 months of treatment. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in ASTAGRAF XL-treated patients were related to infections or renal/urinary disorders.



   Infections  The overall incidence of infections, serious infections, and infections with identified etiology reported in patients treated with the ASTAGRAF XL or tacrolimus immediate-release product in Study 1 are shown in  Table 2  .

      Pediatrics  
 

   De Novo Pediatric Transplant Patients  



 A study was conducted in 44 de novo pediatric transplant patients, (including 25 kidney transplant patients; 13 randomized to Astagraf XL and 12 randomized to Prograf), who were started on 0.3 mg/kg daily of tacrolimus product, given once daily for Astagraf XL and divided into two doses for Prograf. Two kidney transplant patients on Prograf discontinued the study (withdrawn consent, sapovirus enteritis). Thirteen (13) pediatric kidney transplant patients completed 52 weeks on ASTAGRAF XL. The most common adverse reactions were diarrhea [7/13 (54%)], increased blood creatinine [6/13 (46%)], hypertension [3/13 (23%)], cough [4/13 (31%)], and upper respiratory tract infection [4/13 (31%)].



   Stable Pediatric Transplant Patients  



 Another study was conducted in 81 stable pediatric allograft recipients (including 48 kidney transplant patients) 5 to 16 years of age converted 1:1 (mg:mg) from Prograf to ASTAGRAF XL. Seventy-six (76) pediatric patients completed at least one year of ASTAGRAF XL-based treatment. Treatment-related adverse reactions were reported in 35%, including 13% serious adverse reactions. The most frequent adverse reactions by system organ class were infections (55.7%), followed by gastrointestinal disorders (27.8%), skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (21.5%), respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (20.3% each). The most common adverse reactions were diarrhea (13.9%), headache (13.9%) and cough (11.4%).



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been reported from marketing experience with tacrolimus in the U.S. and outside the U.S. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting or causal connection to ASTAGRAF XL:

   5.1 Lymphoma and Other Malignancies



  Immunosuppressants, including ASTAGRAF XL, increase the risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin. The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent. Examine patients for skin changes and advise to avoid or limit exposure to sunlight and UV light by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor.



 Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), associated with Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), has been reported in immunosuppressed organ transplant patients. The risk of PTLD appears greatest in patients who are EBV seronegative, a population which includes many young children. Monitor EBV serology during treatment.



    5.2 Serious Infections



  Immunosuppressants, including ASTAGRAF XL, increase the risk of developing bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoal infections, including opportunistic infections. These infections may lead to serious, including fatal, outcomes. Serious viral infections reported include:



 *    Polyomavirus-associated nephropathy (especially due to BK virus infection) 
 *    JC virus-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) 
 *    Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections: CMV seronegative transplant patients who receive an organ from a CMV seropositive donor are at highest risk of CMV viremia and CMV disease. 
    Monitor for the development of infection and adjust the immunosuppressive regimen to balance the risk of rejection with the risk of infection [see  Adverse Reactions  (  6.1  ,  6.2  )]  .
 

    5.3 Increased Mortality in Female Liver Transplant Patients



  In a clinical trial of 471 liver transplant patients randomized to ASTAGRAF XL or tacrolimus immediate-release product, mortality at 12 months was 10% higher among the 76 female patients (18%) treated with ASTAGRAF XL compared to the 64 female patients (8%) treated with tacrolimus immediate-release product. ASTAGRAF XL is not approved for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in patients who received a liver transplant.



    5.4 Not Interchangeable with Other Tacrolimus Products - Medication Errors



  Medication errors, including substitution and dispensing errors, between tacrolimus immediate-release products and ASTAGRAF XL (tacrolimus extended-release capsules) were reported outside the U.S. This led to serious adverse reactions, including graft rejection, or other adverse reactions due to under- or over-exposure to tacrolimus. ASTAGRAF XL is not substitutable for tacrolimus extended-release tablets, tacrolimus immediate-release capsules or tacrolimus for oral suspension. Instruct patients and caregivers to recognize the appearance of ASTAGRAF XL capsules [see  Dosage Forms and Strengths  (  3  )]  and to confirm with the healthcare provider if a different product is dispensed or if dosing instructions have changed.



    5.5 New Onset Diabetes after Transplant



  ASTAGRAF XL caused new onset diabetes after transplant (NODAT) in kidney transplant patients, which may be reversible in some patients. African-American and Hispanic kidney transplant patients are at an increased risk. Monitor blood glucose concentrations and treat appropriately [see  Adverse Reactions  (  6.1  ) and  Use in Specific Populations  (  8.8  )]  .



    5.6 Nephrotoxicity due to ASTAGRAF XL and Drug Interactions



  ASTAGRAF XL, like other calcineurin-inhibitors, can cause acute or chronic nephrotoxicity. Consider dosage reduction in patients with elevated serum creatinine and tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations greater than the recommended range.



 The risk for nephrotoxicity may increase when ASTAGRAF XL is concomitantly administered with CYP3A inhibitors (by increasing tacrolimus whole blood concentrations) or drugs associated with nephrotoxicity (e.g., aminoglycosides, ganciclovir, amphotericin B, cisplatin, nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors) [see  Adverse Reactions  (  6.1  ,  6.2  ) and  Drug Interactions  (  7.2  )].  Monitor renal function and consider dosage reduction if nephrotoxicity occurs.



    5.7 Neurotoxicity



  ASTAGRAF XL may cause a spectrum of neurotoxicities. The most severe neurotoxicities include posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), delirium, seizure and coma; others include tremors, paresthesias, headache, mental status changes, and changes in motor and sensory functions [see  Adverse Reactions  (  6.1  ,  6.2  )]  . As symptoms may be associated with tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations at or above the recommended range, monitor for neurologic symptoms and consider dosage reduction or discontinuation of ASTAGRAF XL if neurotoxicity occurs.



    5.8 Hyperkalemia



  Mild to severe hyperkalemia, which may require treatment, has been reported with tacrolimus including ASTAGRAF XL. Concomitant use of agents associated with hyperkalemia (e.g., potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers) may increase the risk for hyperkalemia [see  Adverse Reactions  (  6.1  )]  . Monitor serum potassium levels periodically during treatment.



    5.9 Hypertension



  Hypertension is a common adverse reaction of ASTAGRAF XL therapy and may require antihypertensive therapy [see  Adverse Reactions  (  6.1  )]  . Some antihypertensive drugs can increase the risk for hyperkalemia [see  Warnings and Precautions  (  5.8  )]  . Calcium-channel blocking agents may increase tacrolimus blood concentrations and require dosage reduction of ASTAGRAF XL [see  Drug Interactions  (  7.2  )]  .



    5.10 Risk of Rejection with Strong CYP3A Inducers and Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions with Strong CYP3A Inhibitors



  The concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers may increase the metabolism of tacrolimus, leading to lower whole blood trough concentrations and greater risk of rejection. In contrast, the concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors may decrease the metabolism of tacrolimus, leading to higher whole blood trough concentrations and greater risk of serious adverse reactions (e.g., neurotoxicity, QT prolongation) [see  Warnings and Precautions  (  5.7  ,  5.11  )]  . Therefore, adjust ASTAGRAF XL dose and monitor tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations when coadministering ASTAGRAF XL with strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., including but not limited to telaprevir, boceprevir, ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin) or strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., including but not limited to rifampin, rifabutin) [see  Dosage and Administration  (  2.4  ) and  Drug Interactions  (  7.2  )]  .



    5.11 QT Prolongation



  ASTAGRAF XL may prolong the QT/QTc interval and cause Torsade de Pointes  . Avoid ASTAGRAF XL in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. Consider obtaining electrocardiograms and monitoring electrolytes (magnesium, potassium, calcium) periodically during treatment in patients with congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, those taking certain antiarrhythmic medications or other products that lead to QT prolongation, and those with electrolyte disturbances (e.g., hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, or hypomagnesemia).



 When coadministering ASTAGRAF XL with other substrates and/or inhibitors of CYP3A, especially those that also have the potential to prolong the QT interval, a reduction in ASTAGRAF XL dosage, monitoring of tacrolimus whole blood concentrations, and monitoring for QT prolongation is recommended [see  Dosage and Administration  (  2.4  ) and  Drug Interactions  (  7.2  )]  .



    5.12 Immunizations



  Whenever possible, administer the complete complement of vaccines before transplantation and treatment with ASTAGRAF XL.



 Avoid the use of live attenuated vaccines during treatment with ASTAGRAF XL (e.g., intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, yellow fever, varicella, and TY21a typhoid vaccines).



 Inactivated vaccines noted to be safe for administration after transplantation may not be sufficiently immunogenic during treatment with ASTAGRAF XL.



    5.13 Pure Red Cell Aplasia



  Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with tacrolimus. All of these patients reported risk factors for PRCA such as parvovirus B19 infection, underlying disease, or concomitant medications associated with PRCA. A mechanism for tacrolimus-induced PRCA has not been elucidated. If PRCA is diagnosed, consider discontinuation of ASTAGRAF XL.
