  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of BAXDELA cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect rates observed in practice.



 BAXDELA was evaluated in two multicenter, multinational, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, non-inferiority trials (Trial 1 and Trial 2) in adults with ABSSSI. In Trial 1 patients received BAXDELA 300 mg by intravenous infusion every 12 hours and in Trial 2 the patients received BAXDELA 300 mg by intravenous infusion every 12 hours for 6 doses then were switched to BAXDELA 450 mg tablets every 12 hours. The total treatment duration was 5 to 14 days. Adverse reactions were evaluated for 741 patients treated with BAXDELA and 751 patients treated with comparator antibacterial drugs. The median age of patients treated with BAXDELA was 49 years, ranging between 18 and 94 years old; 15% were age 65 years and older. Patients treated with BAXDELA were predominantly male (62%) and Caucasian (86%). The BAXDELA treated population included 44% obese patients (BMI &gt;= 30 kg/m  2  ), 11% with diabetes, and 16% with baseline renal impairment (calculated creatinine clearance less than 90 mL/min).



     Serious Adverse Reactions and Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation  



 Serious adverse reactions occurred in 3/741 (0.4%) of patients treated with BAXDELA and in 6/751 (0.8%) of patients treated with the comparator.



 BAXDELA was discontinued due to an adverse reaction in 7/741 (0.9%) patients and the comparator was discontinued due to an adverse reaction in 21/751 (2.8%) patients. The most commonly reported adverse reactions leading to study discontinuation in the BAXDELA arm included urticaria (2/741; 0.3%) and hypersensitivity (2/741; 0.3%); whereas, the most commonly reported adverse reactions leading to study discontinuation in the comparator arm included urticaria (5/751; 0.7%), rash (4/751; 0.5%), hypersensitivity and infusion site extravasation (2/751; 0.3%).



     Most Common Adverse Reactions  



 The most common adverse reactions in patients treated with BAXDELA were nausea (8%), diarrhea (8%), headache (3%), transaminase elevations (3%), and vomiting (2%). Table 3 lists selected adverse reactions occurring in &gt;= 2 % of patients receiving BAXDELA in the pooled adult Phase 3 clinical trials.

   5.1 Disabling and Potentially Irreversible Serious Adverse Reactions Including Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture, Peripheral Neuropathy and Central Nervous System Effects



  Fluoroquinolones have been associated with disabling and potentially irreversible serious adverse reactions from different body systems that can occur together in the same patient. Commonly seen adverse reactions include tendinitis, tendon rupture, arthralgia, myalgia, peripheral neuropathy, and central nervous system effects (hallucinations, anxiety, depression, insomnia, severe headaches, and confusion). These reactions could occur within hours to weeks after starting a fluoroquinolone. Patients of any age or without pre-existing risk factors have experienced these adverse reactions [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2  ,  5.3  and  5.4)     ]  .



 Discontinue BAXDELA immediately at the first signs or symptoms of any serious adverse reaction. In addition, avoid the use of fluoroquinolones, including BAXDELA, in patients who have experienced any of these serious adverse reactions associated with fluoroquinolones.



    5.2 Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture



  Fluoroquinolones have been associated with an increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture in all ages. This adverse reaction most frequently involves the Achilles tendon, and has also been reported with the rotator cuff (the shoulder), the hand, the biceps, the thumb, and other tendons. Tendinitis or tendon rupture can occur, within hours or days of starting a fluoroquinolone, or as long as several months after completion of fluoroquinolone therapy. Tendinitis and tendon rupture can occur bilaterally.



 This risk of developing fluoroquinolone-associated tendinitis and tendon rupture is increased in patients over age 60 years of age, in patients taking corticosteroid drugs, and, in patients with kidney, heart, and lung transplant. Other factors that may independently increase the risk of tendon rupture include strenuous physical activity, renal failure, and previous tendon disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. Tendinitis and tendon rupture have also occurred in patients taking fluoroquinolones who do not have the above risk factors.



 Discontinue BAXDELA immediately if the patient experiences pain, swelling, inflammation or rupture of a tendon. Advise patients, at the first sign of tendon pain, swelling, or inflammation, to stop taking BAXDELA, to avoid exercise and use of the affected area, and to promptly contact their healthcare provider about changing to a non-quinolone antimicrobial drug. Avoid BAXDELA in patients who have a history of tendon disorders or have experienced tendinitis or tendon rupture .  



    5.3 Peripheral Neuropathy



  Fluoroquinolones have been associated with an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy. Cases of sensory or sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy affecting small and/or large axons resulting in paresthesias, hypoesthesias, dysesthesias, and weakness have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones, including BAXDELA. Symptoms may occur soon after initiation of fluoroquinolones and may be irreversible in some patients [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)     ].  



 Discontinue BAXDELA immediately if the patient experiences symptoms of peripheral neuropathy including pain, burning, tingling, numbness, and/or weakness or other alterations of sensation including light touch, pain, temperature, position sense, and vibratory sensation and/or motor strength in order to minimize the development of an irreversible condition. Avoid fluoroquinolones, including BAXDELA in patients who have previously experienced peripheral neuropathy [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)     ]  .



    5.4 Central Nervous System Effects



    Psychiatric Adverse Reactions    



  Fluoroquinolones have been associated with an increased risk of psychiatric adverse reactions, including: toxic psychosis; hallucinations, or paranoia; depression, or suicidal thoughts or acts; delirium, disorientation, confusion, or disturbances in attention; anxiety, agitation, or nervousness; insomnia or nightmares; memory impairment. These adverse reactions may occur following the first dose. If these reactions occur in patients receiving BAXDELA, discontinue BAXDELA immediately and institute appropriate measures.  



     Central Nervous System Adverse Reactions    



  Fluoroquinolones have been associated with an increased risk of seizures (convulsions), increased intracranial pressure (including pseudotumor cerebri), dizziness, and tremors. As with all fluoroquinolones, use BAXDELA when the benefits of treatment exceed the risks in patients with known or suspected CNS disorders (e.g., severe cerebral arteriosclerosis, epilepsy) or in the presence of other risk factors that may predispose to seizures or lower the seizure threshold .  If these reactions occur in patients receiving BAXDELA, discontinue BAXDELA immediately and institute appropriate measures.  



    5.5 Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis



  Fluoroquinolones have neuromuscular blocking activity and may exacerbate muscle weakness in persons with myasthenia gravis. Post-marketing serious adverse reactions, including death and requirement for ventilator support, have been associated with fluoroquinolone use in persons with myasthenia gravis. Avoid BAXDELA in patients with known history of myasthenia gravis [see  Patient Counseling Information (17)     ]  .



    5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions



  Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions, some following the first dose, have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolone therapy. Some reactions were accompanied by cardiovascular collapse, loss of consciousness, tingling, pharyngeal or facial edema, dyspnea, urticaria, and itching. Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients receiving BAXDELA .  These reactions may occur after first or subsequent doses of BAXDELA [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  Discontinue BAXDELA at the first appearance of a skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity.



    5.7 Clostridium difficile  -Associated Diarrhea



   Clostridium difficile  -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported in users of nearly all systemic antibacterial drugs, including BAXDELA, with severity ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents can alter the normal flora of the colon, and may permit overgrowth of C. difficile  .



  C. difficile  produces toxins A and B, which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile  cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antibacterial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary because CDAD has been reported to occur more than 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents.



 If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial use not directed against C. difficile  should be discontinued, if possible. Appropriate measures such as fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile  , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated



    5.8 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria



  Prescribing BAXDELA in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.



     5.9 Blood Glucose Disturbances  



   Fluoroquinolones have been associated with disturbances of blood glucose, including symptomatic hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, usually in diabetic patients receiving concomitant treatment with an oral hypoglycemic agent (e.g., glyburide) or with insulin. In these patients, careful monitoring of blood glucose is recommended. Severe cases of hypoglycemia resulting in coma or death have been reported with other fluoroquinolones. If a hypoglycemic reaction occurs in a patient being treated with BAXDELA, discontinue BAXDELA and initiate appropriate therapy immediately [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .
