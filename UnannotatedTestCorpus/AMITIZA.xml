  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 During clinical development of Amitiza for CIC, OIC, and IBS-C, 1648 patients were treated with Amitiza for 6 months and 710 patients were treated for 1 year (not mutually exclusive).



     Chronic Idiopathic Constipation  



     Adverse reactions in adult dose-finding, efficacy, and long-term clinical studies:  The data described below reflect exposure to Amitiza 24 mcg twice daily in 1113 patients with CIC over 3- or 4-week, 6-month, and 12-month treatment periods; and from 316 patients receiving placebo over short-term exposure (&lt;=4 weeks). The placebo population (N = 316) had a mean age of 48 (range 21 to 81) years; was 87% female; 81% Caucasian, 10% African American, 7% Hispanic, 1% Asian, and 12% elderly (&gt;=65 years of age). Of those patients treated with Amitiza 24 mcg twice daily (N=1113), the mean age was 50 (range 19-86) years; 87% were female; 86% Caucasian, 8% African American, 5% Hispanic, 1% Asian, and 17% elderly (&gt;=65 years of age).



 The most common adverse reactions (&gt;4%) in CIC were nausea, diarrhea, headache, abdominal pain, abdominal distension, and flatulence.



 Table 2 presents data for the adverse reactions that occurred in at least 1% of patients and that occurred more frequently with Amitiza than placebo.

   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Amitiza. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Cardiovascular:  syncope and/or hypotension  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  , tachycardia  Gastrointestinal:  ischemic colitis  General:  asthenia  Immune System:  hypersensitivity reactions including rash, swelling, and throat tightness malaise  Muscoskeletal:  muscle cramps or muscle spasms.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *   Nausea : Patients may experience nausea; concomitant administration of food may reduce this symptom. (  2.1  ,  5.1  ) 
 *   Diarrhea : Avoid use in patients with severe diarrhea. Instruct patients to discontinue Amitiza and contact their healthcare provider if severe diarrhea occurs during treatment. (  5.2  ) 
 *   Syncope and Hypotension : May occur after taking the first dose or with subsequent doses. Generally resolves prior to the next dose, but may recur with repeat dosing. Instruct patients to discontinue Amitiza and contact their healthcare provider if symptoms occur. (  5.3  ) 
 *   Dyspnea : May occur within an hour of first dose. Generally resolves within 3 hours, but may recur with repeat dosing. Instruct patients to contact their healthcare provider if symptoms occur. (  5.4  ) 
 *   Bowel Obstruction : Evaluate patients with symptoms suggestive of mechanical gastrointestinal obstruction prior to initiating treatment with Amitiza. (  4  ,  5.5  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Nausea



  Patients taking Amitiza may experience nausea. Concomitant administration of food with Amitiza may reduce symptoms of nausea [  see   Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



    5.2 Diarrhea



  Avoid use of Amitiza in patients with severe diarrhea. Patients should be aware of the possible occurrence of diarrhea during treatment. Instruct patients to discontinue Amitiza and contact their healthcare provider if severe diarrhea occurs [  see   Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



    5.3 Syncope and Hypotension



  Syncope and hypotension have been reported with Amitiza in the postmarketing setting and a few of these adverse reactions resulted in hospitalization. Most cases occurred in patients taking 24 mcg twice daily and some occurred within an hour after taking the first dose or subsequent doses of Amitiza. Some patients had concomitant diarrhea or vomiting prior to developing the adverse reaction. Syncope and hypotension generally resolved following Amitiza discontinuation or prior to next dose, but recurrence has been reported with subsequent doses. Several cases reported concomitant use of medications known to lower blood pressure, which may increase the risk for the development of syncope or hypotension.



 Patients should be aware of the risk of syncope and hypotension during treatment and that other adverse reactions may increase this risk, such as diarrhea or vomiting.



    5.4 Dyspnea



  In clinical trials, dyspnea was reported by 3%, 1%, and &lt; 1% of the treated CIC, OIC, and IBS-C populations receiving Amitiza, respectively, compared to 0%, 1%, and &lt; 1% of placebo-treated patients. There have been postmarketing reports of dyspnea when using Amitiza 24 mcg twice daily. Some patients have discontinued treatment because of dyspnea. These events have usually been described as a sensation of chest tightness and difficulty taking in a breath, and generally have an acute onset within 30 to 60 minutes after taking the first dose. They generally resolve within a few hours after taking the dose, but recurrence has been frequently reported with subsequent doses. Instruct patients to contact their healthcare provider if dyspnea occurs.



    5.5 Bowel Obstruction



  In patients with symptoms suggestive of mechanical gastrointestinal obstruction, perform a thorough evaluation to confirm the absence of an obstruction prior to initiating therapy with Amitiza [see  Contraindication (4)  ]  .
