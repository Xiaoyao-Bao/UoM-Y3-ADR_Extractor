  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience in Asthma

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The incidence of adverse reactions associated with AIRDUO RESPICLICK in Table 2 is based upon two placebo-controlled, 12-week, clinical studies (Study 1 and 2). A total of 1,364 adolescent and adult patients previously treated with inhaled corticosteroids were treated twice daily ARMONAIR RESPICLICK 55 mcg, 113 mcg, 232 mcg or AIRDUO RESPICLICK 55/14 mcg, 113/14 mcg, 232/14 mcg, or placebo. Sixty percent of patients were female and 80% of patients were white. The average duration of exposure was 82 to 84 days in the active treatment groups compared with 75 days in the placebo group.

 Other adverse reactions not previously listed (and occurring in &lt;3% of patients and in three or more patients on AIRDUO RESPICLICK), whether considered drug-related or not by the investigators, that were reported more frequently by patients with asthma treated with AIRDUO RESPICLICK compared with patients treated with placebo include the following:



 Sinusitis, oropharyngeal pain, pharyngitis, dizziness, influenza, rhinitis allergic, respiratory tract infection, rhinitis, nasal congestion, abdominal pain upper, myalgia, pain in extremity, dyspepsia, laceration, dermatitis contact, and palpitations.



   Long Term Safety Study.  This was a 26-week, open labeled study of 674 patients previously treated with inhaled corticosteroids who were treated twice daily with ARMONAIR RESPICLICK 113 mcg, 232 mcg, AIRDUO RESPICLICK 113/14 mcg, 232/14 mcg, fluticasone propionate inhalation aerosol 110 mcg and 220 mcg, and fluticasone propionate 250 mcg and salmeterol 50 mcg inhalation powder, and fluticasone propionate 500 mcg and salmeterol 50 mcg inhalation powder. The types of adverse reactions were similar to those reported above in placebo controlled studies.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of fluticasone propionate and/or salmeterol regardless of indication. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or causal connection to fluticasone propionate and/or salmeterol or a combination of these factors.



   Cardiac Disorders  : Arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation, extrasystoles, supraventricular tachycardia), ventricular tachycardia.



   Endocrine Disorders  : Cushing's syndrome, Cushingoid features, growth velocity reduction in children/adolescents, hypercorticism.



   Eye Disorders  : Glaucoma, blurred vision and central serous chorioretinopathy.



   Gastrointestinal Disorders  : Abdominal pain, dyspepsia, xerostomia.



   Immune System Disorders  : Immediate and delayed hypersensitivity reaction (including very rare anaphylactic reaction). Very rare anaphylactic reaction in patients with severe milk protein allergy.

   5.1 Serious Asthma-Related Events - Hospitalizations, Intubations, Death



  Use of LABA as monotherapy (without ICS) for asthma is associated with an increased risk of asthma-related death [see Salmeterol Multicenter Asthma Research Trial (SMART)]  . Available data from controlled clinical trials also suggest that use of LABA as monotherapy increases the risk of asthma-related hospitalization in pediatric and adolescent patients. These findings are considered a class effect of LABA monotherapy. When LABA are used in fixed-dose combination with ICS, data from large clinical trials do not show a significant increase in the risk of serious asthma-related events (hospitalizations, intubations, death) compared with ICS alone [see Serious Asthma-Related Events with Inhaled Corticosteroid/Long-acting Beta2-adrenergic Agonists]  .



  Serious Asthma-Related Events with Inhaled Corticosteroid/Long-acting Beta2-adrenergic Agonists  



 Four large, 26-week, randomized, blinded, active-controlled clinical safety trials were conducted to evaluate the risk of serious asthma-related events when LABA were used in fixed-dose combination with ICS compared with ICS alone in subjects with asthma. Three (3) trials included adult and adolescent subjects aged 12 years and older: 1 trial compared budesonide/formoterol to budesonide, 1 trial compared fluticasone propionate/salmeterol inhalation powder to fluticasone propionate inhalation powder, and 1 trial compared mometasone furoate/formoterol to mometasone furoate. The fourth trial included pediatric subjects aged 4 to 11 years and compared fluticasone propionate/salmeterol inhalation powder to fluticasone propionate inhalation powder. The primary safety endpoint for all 4 trials was serious asthma-related events (hospitalizations, intubations, death). A blinded adjudication committee determined whether events were asthma-related.



 The 3 adult and adolescent trials were designed to rule out a risk margin of 2.0, and the pediatric trial was designed to rule out a risk margin of 2.7. Each individual trial met its pre-specified objective and demonstrated non-inferiority of ICS/LABA to ICS alone. A meta-analysis of the 3 adult and adolescent trials did not show a significant increase in risk of a serious asthma-related event with ICS/LABA fixed-dose combination compared with ICS alone (Table 1). These trials were not designed to rule out all risk for serious asthma-related events with ICS/LABA compared with ICS.

   b  Estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model for time to first event with baseline hazards



 stratified by each of the 3 trials.



   c  Number of subjects with events that occurred within 6 months after the first use of study drug or 7 days after the last date of study drug, whichever date was later. Subjects can have one or more events, but only the first event was counted for analysis. A single, blinded, independent adjudication committee determined whether events were asthma related.



 The pediatric safety trial included 6,208 pediatric patients aged 4 to 11 years who received ICS/LABA (fluticasone propionate/salmeterol inhalation powder) or ICS (fluticasone propionate inhalation powder). In this trial 27/3,107 (0.9%) of patients treated with ICS/LABA and 21/3,101 (0.7%) of patients treated with ICS experienced a serious asthma-related event. There were no asthma-related deaths or intubations. ICS/LABA did not show a significantly increased risk of a serious asthma-related event compared to ICS based on the prespecified risk margin (2.7), with an estimated hazard ratio of time to first event of 1.29 (95% CI: 0.73, 2.27).



  Salmeterol Multicenter Asthma Research Trial (SMART)  



 A 28-week, placebo-controlled, U.S. trial that compared the safety of salmeterol with placebo, each added to usual asthma therapy, showed an increase in asthma-related deaths in subjects receiving salmeterol (13/13,176 in subjects treated with salmeterol versus 3/13,179 in subjects treated with placebo; relative risk: 4.37 [95% CI: 1.25, 15.34]). Use of background ICS was not required in SMART. The increased risk of asthma-related death is considered a class effect of LABA monotherapy.



    5.2 Deterioration of Disease and Acute Episodes



  AIRDUO RESPICLICK should not be initiated in patients during rapidly deteriorating or potentially life-threatening episodes of asthma. AIRDUO RESPICLICK has not been studied in subjects with acutely deteriorating asthma. The initiation of AIRDUO RESPICLICK in this setting is not appropriate.



 Serious acute respiratory events, including fatalities, have been reported when salmeterol, a component of AIRDUO RESPICLICK, has been initiated in patients with significantly worsening or acutely deteriorating asthma. In most cases, these have occurred in patients with severe asthma (e.g., patients with a history of corticosteroid dependence, low pulmonary function, intubation, mechanical ventilation, frequent hospitalizations, previous life-threatening acute asthma exacerbations) and in some patients with acutely deteriorating asthma (e.g., patients with significantly increasing symptoms; increasing need for inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonists; decreasing response to usual medications; increasing need for systemic corticosteroids; recent emergency room visits; deteriorating lung function). However, these events have occurred in a few patients with less severe asthma as well. It was not possible from these reports to determine whether salmeterol contributed to these events.



 Increasing use of inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonists is a marker of deteriorating asthma. In this situation, the patient requires immediate reevaluation with reassessment of the treatment regimen, giving special consideration to the possible need for replacing the current strength of AIRDUO RESPICLICK with a higher strength, adding additional inhaled corticosteroid, or initiating systemic corticosteroids. Patients should not use more than 1 inhalation twice daily of AIRDUO RESPICLICK.



 AIRDUO RESPICLICK should not be used for the relief of acute symptoms, i.e., as rescue therapy for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm. An inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist, not AIRDUO RESPICLICK, should be used to relieve acute symptoms such as shortness of breath. When prescribing AIRDUO RESPICLICK, the healthcare provider should also prescribe an inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist (e.g., albuterol) for treatment of acute symptoms, despite regular twice-daily use of AIRDUO RESPICLICK.



 When beginning treatment with AIRDUO RESPICLICK, patients who have been taking oral or inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonists on a regular basis (e.g., 4 times a day) should be instructed to discontinue the regular use of these drugs.



    5.3 Excessive Use of AIRDUO RESPICLICK and Use with Other Long-Acting Beta2-Agonists



  AIRDUO RESPICLICK should not be used more often than recommended, at higher doses than recommended, or in conjunction with other medicines containing LABA, as an overdose may result. Clinically significant cardiovascular effects and fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs. Patients using AIRDUO RESPICLICK should not use another medicine containing a LABA (e.g., salmeterol, formoterol fumarate, arformoterol tartrate, indacaterol) for any reason.



    5.4 Local Effects of Inhaled Corticosteroids



  In clinical trials, the development of localized infections of the mouth and pharynx with Candida albicans  has occurred in subjects treated with AIRDUO RESPICLICK. When such an infection develops, it should be treated with appropriate local or systemic (i.e., oral) antifungal therapy while treatment with AIRDUO RESPICLICK continues, but at times therapy with AIRDUO RESPICLICK may need to be interrupted. Advise the patient to rinse his/her mouth with water without swallowing following inhalation to help reduce the risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis.



    5.5 Immunosuppression



  Persons who are using drugs that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible adolescents or adults using corticosteroids. In such patients who have not had these diseases or who have not been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If a patient is exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella-zoster immune globulin (VZIG) or pooled intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may be indicated. If a patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.



 Inhaled corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculosis infections of the respiratory tract; systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex.



    5.6 Transferring Patients from Systemic Corticosteroid Therapy



  Particular care is needed for patients who are transferred from systemically active corticosteroids to inhaled corticosteroids because deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred in patients with asthma during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to less systemically available inhaled corticosteroids. After withdrawal from systemic corticosteroids, a number of months are required for recovery of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function.



 Patients who have been previously maintained on 20 mg or more of prednisone (or its equivalent) may be most susceptible, particularly when their systemic corticosteroids have been almost completely withdrawn. During this period of HPA suppression, patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to trauma, surgery, or infection (particularly gastroenteritis) or other conditions associated with severe electrolyte loss. Although AIRDUO RESPICLICK may improve control of asthma symptoms during these episodes, in recommended doses it supplies less than normal physiological amounts of corticosteroid systemically and does NOT provide the mineralocorticoid activity that is necessary for coping with these emergencies.



 During periods of stress or a severe asthmatic attack, patients who have been withdrawn from systemic corticosteroids should be instructed to resume oral corticosteroids (in large doses) immediately and to contact their physician for further instruction. These patients should also be instructed to carry a medical identification warning card indicating that they may need supplementary systemic corticosteroids during periods of stress or a severe asthma attack.



 Patients requiring systemic corticosteroids should be weaned slowly from systemic corticosteroid use after transferring to AIRDUO RESPICLICK. Lung function (mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] or morning peak expiratory flow [AM PEF]), beta-agonist use, and asthma symptoms should be carefully monitored during withdrawal of systemic corticosteroids. In addition to monitoring asthma signs and symptoms, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, such as fatigue, lassitude, weakness, nausea and vomiting, and hypotension.



 Transfer of patients from systemic corticosteroid therapy to AIRDUO RESPICLICK may unmask allergic conditions previously suppressed by the systemic corticosteroid therapy (e.g., rhinitis, conjunctivitis, eczema, arthritis, eosinophilic conditions).



 During withdrawal from oral corticosteroids, some patients may experience symptoms of systemically active corticosteroid withdrawal (e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, depression) despite maintenance or even improvement of respiratory function.



    5.7 Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression



  Fluticasone propionate, a component of AIRDUO RESPICLICK, will often help control asthma symptoms with less suppression of HPA function than therapeutically equivalent oral doses of prednisone. Since fluticasone propionate is absorbed into the circulation and can be systemically active at higher doses, the beneficial effects of AIRDUO RESPICLICK in minimizing HPA dysfunction may be expected only when recommended dosages are not exceeded and individual patients are titrated to the lowest effective dose. A relationship between plasma levels of fluticasone propionate and inhibitory effects on stimulated cortisol production has been shown after 4 weeks of treatment with fluticasone propionate inhalation aerosol. Since individual sensitivity to effects on cortisol production exists, physicians should consider this information when prescribing AIRDUO RESPICLICK.



 Because of the possibility of significant systemic absorption of inhaled corticosteroids, patients treated with AIRDUO RESPICLICK should be observed carefully for any evidence of systemic corticosteroid effects. Particular care should be taken in observing patients postoperatively or during periods of stress for evidence of inadequate adrenal response.



 It is possible that systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression (including adrenal crisis) may appear in a small number of patients who are sensitive to these effects. If such effects occur, AIRDUO RESPICLICK should be reduced slowly, consistent with accepted procedures for reducing systemic corticosteroids, and for management of asthma symptoms.



    5.8 Drug Interactions with Strong Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors



  The use of strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, ketoconazole, telithromycin) with AIRDUO RESPICLICK is not recommended because increased systemic corticosteroid and increased cardiovascular adverse effects may occur [see Drug Interactions (  7.1  ), Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )].  



    5.9 Paradoxical Bronchospasm and Upper Airway Symptoms



  As with other inhaled medicines, AIRDUO RESPICLICK can produce paradoxical bronchospasm, which may be life-threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs following dosing with inhaled fluticasone propionate/salmeterol medicines, it should be treated immediately with an inhaled, short-acting bronchodilator; inhaled fluticasone propionate/salmeterol medicines should be discontinued immediately; and alternative therapy should be instituted. Upper airway symptoms of laryngeal spasm, irritation, or swelling, such as stridor and choking, have been reported in patients receiving inhaled fluticasone propionate/salmeterol medicines.



    5.10 Hypersensitivity Reactions, Including Anaphylaxis



  Immediate hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, hypotension), including anaphylaxis, may occur after administration of AIRDUO RESPICLICK. There have been reports of anaphylactic reactions in patients with severe milk protein allergy after inhalation of other powder products containing lactose; therefore, patients with severe milk protein allergy should not use AIRDUO RESPICLICK [see Contraindications (  4  )].  



    5.11 Cardiovascular and Central Nervous System Effects



  Excessive beta-adrenergic stimulation has been associated with seizures, angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia with rates up to 200 beats/min, arrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, palpitation, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, and insomnia [see Overdosage (  10.2  )].  Therefore, AIRDUO RESPICLICK, like all products containing sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension.



 Salmeterol, a component of AIRDUO RESPICLICK, can produce a clinically significant cardiovascular effect in some patients as measured by pulse rate, blood pressure, and/or symptoms. Although such effects are uncommon after administration of salmeterol at recommended doses, if they occur, the drug may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta-agonists have been reported to produce electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, such as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Large doses of inhaled or oral salmeterol (12 to 20 times the recommended dose) have been associated with clinically significant prolongation of the QTc interval, which has the potential for producing ventricular arrhythmias. Fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs.



    5.12 Reduction in Bone Mineral Density



  Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) have been observed with long-term administration of products containing inhaled corticosteroids. The clinical significance of small changes in BMD with regard to long-term consequences such as fracture is unknown. Patients with major risk factors for decreased bone mineral content, such as prolonged immobilization, family history of osteoporosis, or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass (e.g., anticonvulsants, oral corticosteroids) should be monitored and treated with established standards of care.



    5.13 Effect on Growth



  Orally inhaled corticosteroids, including AIRDUO RESPICLICK, may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. Monitor the growth of pediatric patients receiving AIRDUO RESPICLICK routinely (e.g., via stadiometry). To minimize the systemic effects of orally inhaled corticosteroids, including AIRDUO RESPICLICK, titrate each patient's dosage to the lowest dosage that effectively controls his/her symptoms [see Dosage and Administration (  2  ), Use in Specific Populations (  8.4  )]  .



    5.14 Glaucoma and Cataracts



  Glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and cataracts have been reported in patients following the long-term administration of inhaled corticosteroids, including fluticasone propionate, a component of AIRDUO RESPICLICK. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts.



 Effects of treatment with other Fluticasone Propionate and Salmeterol Inhalation Powder 500/50, fluticasone propionate 500 mcg, salmeterol 50 mcg, or placebo on development of cataracts or glaucoma was evaluated in a subset of 658 subjects with COPD in the 3-year survival trial. Ophthalmic examinations were conducted at baseline and at 48, 108, and 158 weeks. Conclusions about cataracts cannot be drawn from this trial because the high incidence of cataracts at baseline (61% to 71%) resulted in an inadequate number of subjects treated with other Fluticasone Propionate and Salmeterol Inhalation Powder 500/50 who were eligible and available for evaluation of cataracts at the end of the trial (n = 53). The incidence of newly diagnosed glaucoma was 2% with other Fluticasone Propionate and Salmeterol Inhalation Powder 500/50, 5% with fluticasone propionate, 0% with salmeterol, and 2% with placebo.



    5.15 Eosinophilic Conditions and Churg-Strauss Syndrome



  In rare cases, patients on inhaled fluticasone propionate, a component of AIRDUO RESPICLICK, may present with systemic eosinophilic conditions. Some of these patients have clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome, a condition that is often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These events usually, but not always, have been associated with the reduction and/or withdrawal of oral corticosteroid therapy following the introduction of fluticasone propionate. Cases of serious eosinophilic conditions have also been reported with other inhaled corticosteroids in this clinical setting. Physicians should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients. A causal relationship between fluticasone propionate and these underlying conditions has not been established.



    5.16 Coexisting Conditions



  AIRDUO RESPICLICK, like all medicines containing sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with convulsive disorders or thyrotoxicosis and in those who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines. Doses of the related beta2-adrenoceptor agonist albuterol, when administered intravenously, have been reported to aggravate preexisting diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis.



    5.17 Hypokalemia and Hyperglycemia



  Beta-adrenergic agonist medicines may produce significant hypokalemia in some patients, possibly through intracellular shunting, which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects [see Clinical Pharmacology (  12.2  )]  . The decrease in serum potassium is usually transient, not requiring supplementation. Clinically significant changes in blood glucose and/or serum potassium were seen infrequently during clinical trials with AIRDUO RESPICLICK at recommended doses.
