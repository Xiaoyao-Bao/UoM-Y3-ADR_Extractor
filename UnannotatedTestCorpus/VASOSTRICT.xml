  The following adverse reactions associated with the use of vasopressin were identified in the literature. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to estimate their frequency reliably or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 Bleeding/lymphatic system disorders: Hemorrhagic shock, decreased platelets, intractable bleeding



 Cardiac disorders: Right heart failure, atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, myocardial ischemia



 Gastrointestinal disorders: Mesenteric ischemia



 Hepatobiliary: Increased bilirubin levels



 Renal/urinary disorders: Acute renal insufficiency



 Vascular disorders: Distal limb ischemia



 Metabolic: Hyponatremia



 Skin: Ischemic lesions



   EXCERPT:   The most common adverse reactions include decreased cardiac output, bradycardia, tachyarrhythmias, hyponatremia and ischemia (coronary, mesenteric, skin, digital). (  6  )



   To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Par Pharmaceutical at 1-800-828-9393 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.
