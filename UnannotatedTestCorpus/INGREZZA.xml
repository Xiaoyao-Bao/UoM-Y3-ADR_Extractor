  The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling:

      EXCERPT:   Most common adverse reaction (&gt;=5% and twice the rate of placebo): somnolence. (  6.1  )
 

   To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc. at 877-641-3461 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.  



 

    6.1    Clinical Trials Experience  

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



   Variable    and Fixed Dose         Placebo-Controlled Trial Experience  



 The safety of INGREZZA was evaluated in 3 placebo-controlled studies, each 6 weeks in duration (fixed dose, dose escalation, dose reduction), including 445 patients. Patients were 26 to 84 years of age with moderate to severe tardive dyskinesia and had concurrent diagnoses of mood disorder (27%) or schizophrenia/ schizoaffective disorder (72%). The mean age was 56 years. Patients were 57% Caucasian, 39% African-American, and 4% other. With respect to ethnicity, 28% were Hispanic or Latino. All subjects continued previous stable regimens of antipsychotics; 85% and 27% of subjects, respectively, were taking atypical and typical antipsychotic medications at study entry.  



   Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation of Treatment    



 A total of 3% of INGREZZA treated patients and 2% of placebo-treated patients discontinued because of adverse reactions.



   Common Adverse Reactions  



 Adverse reactions that occurred in the 3 placebo-controlled studies at an incidence of &gt;=2% and greater than placebo are presented in Table 1.

   Other Adverse Reactions Observed    During the Premarketing Evaluation of INGREZZA  



 Other adverse reactions of &gt;=1% incidence and greater than placebo are shown below. The following list does not include adverse reactions: 1) already listed in previous tables or elsewhere in the labeling, 2) for which a drug cause was remote, 3) which were so general as to be uninformative, 4) which were not considered to have clinically significant implications, or 5) which occurred at a rate equal to or less than placebo.



   Endocrine Disorders:  blood glucose increased



   General Disorders:   weight increased



   Infectious Disorders:  respiratory infections



   Neurologic Disorders:  drooling, dyskinesia, extrapyramidal symptoms (non-akathisia)



   Psychiatric Disorders:   anxiety, insomnia



 During controlled trials, there was a dose-related increase in prolactin. Additionally, there was a dose-related increase in alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin, suggesting a potential risk for cholestasis.



     6.2    Postmarketing Experience  

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of INGREZZA that are not included in other sections of labeling. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Immune System Disorders:  hypersensitivity reactions (including allergic dermatitis, angioedema, pruritis, and urticaria)



   Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders  : rash

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">     5   WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  



   EXCERPT:    *  Somnolence: May impair patient's ability to drive or operate hazardous machinery. (  5.1  ) 
 *  QT Prolongation: May cause an increase in QT interval. Avoid use in patients with congenital long QT syndrome or with arrhythmias associated with a prolonged QT interval. (  5.2  ) 
    
 

    5.1   Somnolence  



  INGREZZA can cause somnolence. Patients should not perform activities requiring mental alertness such as operating a motor vehicle or operating hazardous machinery until they know how they will be affected by INGREZZA [see Adverse Reactions (     6.1     )].  



     5.2   QT Prolongation  



  INGREZZA may prolong the QT interval, although the degree of QT prolongation is not clinically significant at concentrations expected with recommended dosing. In patients taking a strong CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitor, or who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, INGREZZA concentrations may be higher and QT prolongation clinically significant  [see Clinical Pharmacology (     12.2     )]  . For patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers or are taking a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor, dose reduction may be necessary. For patients taking a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, reduce the dose of INGREZZA to 40 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (     2.3     ,     2.4     )].   INGREZZA should be avoided in patients with congenital long QT syndrome or with arrhythmias associated with a prolonged QT interval.  For patients at increased risk of a prolonged QT interval, assess the QT interval before increasing the dosage.
