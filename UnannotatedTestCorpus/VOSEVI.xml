  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     Adverse Reactions in HCV-Infected Subjects without Cirrhosis or with Compensated Cirrhosis  



 The adverse reactions data for VOSEVI were derived from two Phase 3 clinical trials (POLARIS-1 and POLARIS-4) that evaluated a total of 445 subjects infected with genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 HCV, without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A), who received VOSEVI for 12 weeks. VOSEVI was studied in placebo- and active-controlled (sofosbuvir/velpatasvir) trials  [see  Clinical Studies (14.1  and  14.2)  ].  



 The proportion of subjects who permanently discontinued treatment due to adverse events was 0.2% for subjects who received VOSEVI for 12 weeks.



 The most common adverse reactions (adverse events assessed as causally related by the investigator and at least 10%) were headache, fatigue, diarrhea, and nausea in subjects treated with VOSEVI for 12 weeks.



 Table 2 lists adverse reactions (adverse events assessed as causally related by the investigator, all grades) observed in at least 5% of subjects receiving 12 weeks of treatment with VOSEVI in the Phase 3 clinical trials. The side-by-side tabulation is to simplify presentation; direct comparison across trials should not be made due to differing trial designs.

           In POLARIS-1, of the subjects receiving VOSEVI who experienced adverse reactions, 99% were mild or moderate (Grade 1 or 2) in severity. In POLARIS-4, of the subjects receiving VOSEVI who experienced adverse reactions, all the reported adverse reactions were mild or moderate (Grade 1 or 2) in severity.
 

     Less Common Adverse Reactions Reported in Clinical Trials  



 The following adverse reactions occurred in less than 5% of subjects without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis treated with VOSEVI for 12 weeks and are included because of a potential causal relationship.



     Rash:  In the POLARIS-1 and POLARIS-4 trials, rash occurred in less than 1% and 2% of subjects treated with VOSEVI, respectively. Rash was reported in 1% of subjects treated with placebo in POLARIS-1, and was not reported by any subject taking sofosbuvir/velpatasvir in POLARIS-4. No serious adverse reactions of rash occurred and all rashes were mild or moderate in severity.



     Depression:  In the POLARIS-1 and POLARIS-4 trials, depressed mood occurred in less than 1% and 1% of subjects treated with VOSEVI, respectively. Depressed mood was not reported by any subject taking placebo in POLARIS-1 and was reported in 1% of subjects treated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir in POLARIS-4. No serious adverse reactions of depressed mood occurred and all events were mild or moderate in severity.



     Laboratory Abnormalities  



     Lipase Elevations:  Isolated, asymptomatic lipase elevations of greater than 3*ULN were observed in POLARIS-1 in 2% of subjects treated with VOSEVI and 3% of subjects treated with placebo, and in POLARIS-4 in 2% of subjects treated with VOSEVI and less than 1% of subjects treated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir.



     Creatine Kinase:  Isolated, asymptomatic creatine kinase elevations greater than or equal to 10*ULN were reported in POLARIS-1 in 1% of subjects treated with VOSEVI and 1% of subjects treated with placebo, and in POLARIS-4 in less than 1% of subjects treated with VOSEVI and no subjects treated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir.



     Total bilirubin:  Increases in total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5*ULN were observed in subjects treated with VOSEVI due to inhibition of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 by voxilaprevir: 4% and 6% of subjects without cirrhosis in POLARIS-1 and POLARIS-4, respectively; and 7% and 13% of subjects with compensated cirrhosis in POLARIS-1 and POLARIS-4, respectively. No subjects experienced jaundice and total bilirubin levels decreased after completing VOSEVI treatment.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of sofosbuvir-containing regimens. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



     Cardiac Disorders  



 Serious symptomatic bradycardia has been reported in patients taking amiodarone who initiated treatment with a sofosbuvir-containing regimen  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  and  Drug Interactions (7.3)  ].  



     Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders  



 Skin rashes, sometimes with blisters or angioedema-like swelling

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: RISK OF HEPATITIS B VIRUS REACTIVATION IN PATIENTS COINFECTED WITH HCV AND HBV

    WARNING: RISK OF HEPATITIS B VIRUS REACTIVATION IN PATIENTS COINFECTED WITH HCV AND HBV  

    Test all patients for evidence of current or prior hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection before initiating treatment with VOSEVI. HBV reactivation has been reported in HCV/HBV coinfected patients who were undergoing or had completed treatment with HCV direct-acting antivirals (DAA) and were not receiving HBV antiviral therapy. Some cases have resulted in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death. Monitor HCV/HBV coinfected patients for hepatitis flare or HBV reactivation during HCV treatment and post-treatment follow-up. Initiate appropriate patient management for HBV infection as clinically indicated   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ].    



   EXCERPT:   WARNING: RISK OF HEPATITIS B VIRUS REACTIVATION IN PATIENTS COINFECTED WITH HCV AND HBV



   See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.  



   Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation has been reported, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death. (  5.1  )  



 
</Section>
    <Section id="S3" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Risk of Hepatitis B virus reactivation: Test all patients for evidence of current or prior HBV infection before initiation of HCV treatment. Monitor HCV/HBV coinfected patients for HBV reactivation and hepatitis flare during HCV treatment and post-treatment follow-up. Initiate appropriate patient management for HBV infection as clinically indicated. (  5.1  ) 
 *  Bradycardia with amiodarone coadministration: Serious symptomatic bradycardia may occur in patients taking amiodarone with VOSEVI, a sofosbuvir-containing regimen, particularly in patients also receiving beta blockers, or those with underlying cardiac comorbidities and/or advanced liver disease. Coadministration of amiodarone with VOSEVI is not recommended. In patients without alternative viable treatment options, cardiac monitoring is recommended. (  5.2  ,  7.3  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Risk of Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation in Patients Coinfected with HCV and HBV



  Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation has been reported in HCV/HBV coinfected patients who were undergoing or had completed treatment with HCV direct-acting antivirals, and who were not receiving HBV antiviral therapy. Some cases have resulted in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death. Cases have been reported in patients who are HBsAg positive and also in patients with serologic evidence of resolved HBV infection (i.e., HBsAg negative and anti-HBc positive). HBV reactivation has also been reported in patients receiving certain immunosuppressant or chemotherapeutic agents; the risk of HBV reactivation associated with treatment with HCV direct-acting antivirals may be increased in these patients.



 HBV reactivation is characterized as an abrupt increase in HBV replication manifesting as a rapid increase in serum HBV DNA level. In patients with resolved HBV infection reappearance of HBsAg can occur. Reactivation of HBV replication may be accompanied by hepatitis, i.e., increases in aminotransferase levels and, in severe cases, increases in bilirubin levels, liver failure, and death can occur.



 Test all patients for evidence of current or prior HBV infection by measuring HBsAg and anti-HBc before initiating HCV treatment with VOSEVI. In patients with serologic evidence of HBV infection, monitor for clinical and laboratory signs of hepatitis flare or HBV reactivation during HCV treatment with VOSEVI and during post-treatment follow-up. Initiate appropriate patient management for HBV infection as clinically indicated.



    5.2 Serious Symptomatic Bradycardia When Coadministered with Amiodarone



  Postmarketing cases of symptomatic bradycardia and cases requiring pacemaker intervention have been reported when amiodarone is coadministered with a sofosbuvir-containing regimen. A fatal cardiac arrest was reported in a patient taking amiodarone who was coadministered a sofosbuvir-containing regimen (HARVONI  (r)  (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir)). Bradycardia has generally occurred within hours to days, but cases have been observed up to 2 weeks after initiating HCV treatment. Patients also taking beta blockers, or those with underlying cardiac comorbidities and/or advanced liver disease may be at increased risk for symptomatic bradycardia with coadministration of amiodarone. Bradycardia generally resolved after discontinuation of HCV treatment. The mechanism for this effect is unknown.



 Coadministration of amiodarone with VOSEVI is not recommended. For patients taking amiodarone who have no other alternative viable treatment options and who will be coadministered VOSEVI:



 *  Counsel patients about the risk of symptomatic bradycardia. 
 *  Cardiac monitoring in an in-patient setting for the first 48 hours of coadministration is recommended, after which outpatient or self-monitoring of the heart rate should occur on a daily basis through at least the first 2 weeks of treatment. 
    Patients who are taking VOSEVI who need to start amiodarone therapy due to no other alternative viable treatment options should undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above.
 

 Due to amiodarone's long half-life, patients discontinuing amiodarone just prior to starting VOSEVI should also undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above.



 Patients who develop signs or symptoms of bradycardia should seek medical evaluation immediately. Symptoms may include near-fainting or fainting, dizziness or lightheadedness, malaise, weakness, excessive tiredness, shortness of breath, chest pains, confusion, or memory problems [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  and  Drug Interactions (7.3)  ].  



    5.3 Risk of Reduced Therapeutic Effect Due to Concomitant Use of VOSEVI with Inducers of P-gp and/or Moderate to Potent Inducers of CYP



  Drugs that are inducers of P-gp and/or moderate to potent inducers of CYP2B6, CYP2C8, or CYP3A4 (e.g., St. John's wort, carbamazepine) may significantly decrease plasma concentrations of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir, and/or voxilaprevir, leading to potentially reduced therapeutic effect of VOSEVI. The use of these agents with VOSEVI is not recommended [see  Drug Interactions (7.3)  ].
