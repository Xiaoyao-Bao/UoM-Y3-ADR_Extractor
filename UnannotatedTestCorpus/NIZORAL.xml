   Post-Marketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of NIZORAL  (r)  Tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 The following adverse reactions were reported during post-marketing experience:



   Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders:  thrombocytopenia



   Immune System Disorders:  allergic conditions including anaphylactic shock, anaphylactic reaction, angioneurotic edema

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING

    WARNING  

  NIZORAL  (r)   Tablets should be used only when other effective antifungal therapy is not available or tolerated and the potential benefits are considered to outweigh the potential risks.



   Hepatotoxicity  



 Serious hepatotoxicity, including cases with a fatal outcome or requiring liver transplantation has occurred with the use of oral ketoconazole. Some patients had no obvious risk factors for liver disease. Patients receiving this drug should be informed by the physician of the risk and should be closely monitored. See    WARNINGS    section.



   QT Prolongation and Drug Interactions Leading to QT Prolongation  



 Co-administration of the following drugs with ketoconazole is contraindicated: dofetilide, quinidine, pimozide, cisapride, methadone, disopyramide, dronedarone, ranolazine. Ketoconazole can cause elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs and may prolong QT intervals, sometimes resulting in life-threatening ventricular dysrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. See   CONTRAINDICATIONS  ,   WARNINGS  , and    PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions    sections.
</Section>
    <Section id="S3" name="precautions">    PRECAUTIONS



   General



  NIZORAL  (r)  Tablets have been demonstrated to lower serum testosterone. Once therapy with NIZORAL  (r)  Tablets has been discontinued, serum testosterone levels return to baseline values. Testosterone levels are impaired with doses of 800 mg per day and abolished by 1600 mg per day. Clinical manifestations of decreased testosterone concentrations may include gynecomastia, impotence and oligospermia.



    Information for Patients



  Patients should be instructed to report any signs and symptoms which may suggest liver dysfunction so that appropriate biochemical testing can be done. Such signs and symptoms may include unusual fatigue, anorexia, nausea and/or vomiting, abdominal pain, jaundice, dark urine or pale stools (see  WARNINGS  section).



    Drug Interactions



  Ketoconazole is mainly metabolized through CYP3A4. Other substances that either share this metabolic pathway or modify CYP3A4 activity may influence the pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole. Similarly, ketoconazole may modify the pharmacokinetics of other substances that share this metabolic pathway. Ketoconazole is a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor and a P-glycoprotein inhibitor. When using concomitant medication, the corresponding label should be consulted for information on the route of metabolism and the possible need to adjust dosages.



 Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. The relevance of the results from these studies in pediatric patients is unknown.



    Drugs that may decrease ketoconazole plasma concentrations



  Drugs that reduce the gastric acidity (e.g. acid neutralizing medicines such as aluminum hydroxide, or acid secretion suppressors such as H2-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors) impair the absorption of ketoconazole from NIZORAL  (r)  Tablets. These drugs should be used with caution when coadministered with NIZORAL  (r)  Tablets:



 *  NIZORAL  (r)  Tablets should be administered with an acidic beverage (such as non-diet cola) upon co-treatment with drugs reducing gastric acidity. 
 *  Acid neutralizing medicines (e.g. aluminum hydroxide) should be administered at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the intake of NIZORAL  (r)  Tablets. 
 *  Upon coadministration, the antifungal activity should be monitored and the NIZORAL  (r)  Tablets dose increased as deemed necessary. 
    Coadministration of NIZORAL  (r)  Tablets with potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the bioavailability of ketoconazole to such an extent that efficacy may be reduced. Examples include:
 

 *  Antibacterials: isoniazid, rifabutin (see also under '  Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased  '), rifampicin. 
 *  Anticonvulsants: carbamazepine (see also under '  Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased  '), phenytoin. 
 *  Antivirals: efavirenz, nevirapine. 
    Therefore, administration of potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 with NIZORAL  (r)  Tablets is not recommended. The use of these drugs should be avoided from 2 weeks before and during treatment with NIZORAL  (r)  Tablets, unless the benefits outweigh the risk of potentially reduced ketoconazole efficacy. Upon coadministration, the antifungal activity should be monitored and the NIZORAL  (r)  Tablets dose increased as deemed necessary.
 

    Drugs that may increase ketoconazole plasma concentrations



  Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. antivirals such as ritonavir, ritonavir-boosted darunavir and ritonavir-boosted fosamprenavir) may increase the bioavailability of ketoconazole. These drugs should be used with caution when coadministered with NIZORAL  (r)  Tablets. Patients who must take NIZORAL  (r)  Tablets concomitantly with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged pharmacologic effects of ketoconazole, and the NIZORAL  (r)  Tablets dose should be decreased as deemed necessary. When appropriate, ketoconazole plasma concentrations should be measured.



    Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by ketoconazole



  Ketoconazole can inhibit the metabolism of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 and can inhibit the drug transport by P-glycoprotein, which may result in increased plasma concentrations of these drugs and/or their active metabolite(s) when they are administered with ketoconazole. These elevated plasma concentrations may increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects of these drugs. CYP3A4-metabolized drugs known to prolong the QT interval may be contraindicated with NIZORAL  (r)  Tablets, since the combination may lead to ventricular tachyarrhythmias, including occurrences of torsade de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia.



 Examples of drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by ketoconazole presented by drug class with advice regarding coadministration with NIZORAL  (r)  Tablets:




 Drug Class            Contraindicated       Not Recommended       Use with Caution      Comments               
  
                        Under no circumstances should the drug be coadministered with NIZORAL  (r)  Tablets, and up to one week after discontinuation of treatment with ketoconazole.     The use of the drug should be avoided during and up to one week after discontinuation of treatment with NIZORAL  (r)  Tablets, unless the benefits outweigh the potentially increased risks of side effects. If coadministration cannot be avoided, clinical monitoring for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged effects or side effects of the interacting drug is recommended, and its dosage should be reduced or interrupted as deemed necessary. When appropriate, plasma concentrations should be measured. The label of the coadministered drug should be consulted for information on dose adjustment and adverse effects.     Careful monitoring is recommended when the drug is coadministered with NIZORAL  (r)  Tablets. Upon coadministration, patients should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged effects or side effects of the interacting drug, and its dosage should be reduced as deemed necessary. When appropriate, plasma concentrations should be measured. The label of the coadministered drug should be consulted for information on dose adjustment and adverse effects.                           
 Alpha Blockers                              tamsulosin                                                         
 Analgesics            methadone                                   alfentanil, buprenorphine IV and sublingual, fentanyl, oxycodone, sufentanil   Methadone: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of methadone when coadministered with NIZORAL(r) Tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation and torsade de pointes, or respiratory or CNS depression. [See CONTRAINDICATIONS.]  Fentanyl: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of fentanyl when coadministered with NIZORAL(r) Tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal respiratory depression.  Sufentanil: No human pharmacokinetic data of an interaction with ketoconazole are available. In vitro data suggest that sufentanil is metabolized by CYP3A4 and so potentially increased sufentanil plasma concentrations would be expected when coadministered with NIZORAL(r) Tablets.    
 Antiarrhythmics       disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine                        digoxin                Disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of these drugs when coadministered with ketoconazole may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation.  Digoxin: Rare cases of elevated plasma concentrations of digoxin have been reported. It is not clear whether this was due to the combination of therapy. It is, therefore, advisable to monitor digoxin concentrations in patients receiving ketoconazole.    
 Antibacterials                              rifabutin             telithromycin          Rifabutin: see also under 'Drugs that may decrease ketoconazole plasma concentrations'.  Telithromycin: A multiple-dose interaction study with ketoconazole showed that Cmax of telithromycin was increased by 51% and AUC by 95%.    
 Anticoagulants and Antiplatelet Drugs                        rivaroxaban           cilostazol, coumarins, dabigatran   Cilostazol: Concomitant administration of single doses of cilostazol 100 mg and ketoconazole 400 mg approximately doubled cilostazol concentrations and altered (increase/decrease) the concentrations of the active metabolites of cilostazol.  Coumarins: Ketoconazole may enhance the anticoagulant effect of coumarin-like drugs, thus the anticoagulant effect should be carefully titrated and monitored.  Dabigatran: In patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCL 50 mL/min to &lt;= 80 mL/min), consider reducing the dose of dabigatran to 75 mg twice daily when it is coadministered with ketoconazole.    
 Anticonvulsants                             carbamazepine                               Carbamazepine: In vivo  studies have demonstrated an increase in plasma carbamazepine concentrations in subjects concomitantly receiving ketoconazole. In addition, the bioavailability of ketoconazole may be reduced by carbamazepine.   
 Antidiabetics                                                     repaglinide, saxagliptin                         
 Antihelmintics and Antiprotozoals                                              praziquantel                                 
 Antimigraine Drugs    ergot alkaloids, such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine (ergonovine), ergotamine, methylergometrine (methylergonovine)                        eletriptan             Ergot alkaloids: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of ergot alkaloids when coadministered with NIZORAL(r) Tablets may increase the risk of ergotism, i.e., a risk for vasospasm potentially leading to cerebral ischemia and/or ischemia of the extremities.  Eletriptan: Eletriptan should be used with caution with ketoconazole, and specifically, should not be used within at least 72 hours of treatment with ketoconazole.    
 Antineoplastics       irinotecan            dasatinib, lapatinib, nilotinib  bortezomib, busulphan, docetaxel, erlotinib, imatinib, ixabepilone, paclitaxel, trimetrexate, vinca alkaloids   Irinotecan: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of irinotecan when coadministered with NIZORAL(r) Tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal adverse events.  Docetaxel: In the presence of ketoconazole, the clearance of docetaxel in cancer patients was shown to decrease by 50%.    
 Antipsychotics, Anxiolytics and Hypnotics  alprazolam, lurasidone, oral midazolam, pimozide, triazolam                        aripiprazole, buspirone, haloperidol, midazolam IV, quetiapine, ramelteon, risperidone   Alprazolam, midazolam, triazolam: Coadministration of NIZORAL(r) Tablets with oral midazolam or triazolam, or alprazolam may cause several-fold increases in plasma concentrations of these drugs. This may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects, especially with repeated dosing or chronic administration of these agents.  Pimozide: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of pimozide when coadministered with NIZORAL(r) Tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation and torsade de pointes.  Aripiprazole: Coadministration of ketoconazole (200 mg/day for 14 days) with a 15 mg single dose of aripiprazole increased the AUC of aripiprazole and its active metabolite by 63% and 77%, respectively. The effect of a higher ketoconazole dose (400 mg/day) has not been studied. When ketoconazole is given concomitantly with aripiprazole, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced to one-half of the recommended dose.  Buspirone: Ketoconazole is expected to inhibit buspirone metabolism and increase plasma concentrations of buspirone. If a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on buspirone, a dose reduction of buspirone may be necessary to avoid adverse events attributable to buspirone or diminished anxiolytic activity.    
 Antivirals                                                        indinavir, maraviroc, saquinavir                         
 Beta Blockers                                                     nadolol                                      
 Calcium Channel Blockers  felodipine, nisoldipine                        other dihydropyridines, verapamil   Calcium channel blockers can have a negative inotropic effect which may be additive to those of ketoconazole. The potential increase in plasma concentrations of calcium channel blockers when co-administered with NIZORAL(r) Tablets may increase the risk of edema and congestive heart failure.  Dihydropyridines: Concomitant administration of NIZORAL(r) Tablets may cause several-fold increases in plasma concentrations of dihydropyridines.    
 Cardiovascular Drugs, Miscellaneous  ranolazine                                  aliskiren, bosentan    Ranolazine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of ranolazine when coadministered with NIZORAL(r) Tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation.  Bosentan: Coadministration of bosentan 125 mg twice daily and ketoconazole, increased the plasma concentrations of bosentan by approximately 2-fold in normal volunteers. No dose adjustment of bosentan is necessary, but patients should be monitored for increased pharmacologic effects and adverse reactions of bosentan.    
 Diuretics             eplerenone                                                        The potential increase in plasma concentrations of eplerenone when coadministered with NIZORAL  (r)  Tablets may increase the risk of hyperkalemia and hypotension.   
 Gastrointestinal Drugs  cisapride                                   aprepitant            Cisapride: Oral ketoconazole potently inhibits the metabolism of cisapride resulting in a mean eight-fold increase in AUC of cisapride, which can lead to serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation.   
 Immunosuppressants                          everolimus, rapamycin (also known as sirolimus), temsirolimus  budesonide, ciclesonide, cyclosporine, dexamethasone, fluticasone, methylprednisolone, tacrolimus   Rapamycin (sirolimus): NIZORAL(r) Tablets 200 mg daily for 10 days increased the Cmax and AUC of a single 5-mg dose of sirolimus by 4.3-fold and 10.9-fold, respectively in 23 healthy subjects.  Fluticasone: Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and ketoconazole is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects.    
 Lipid Regulating Drugs  lovastatin, simvastatin                        atorvastatin          The potential increase in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, lovastatin and simvastatin when coadministered with NIZORAL  (r)  Tablets may increase the risk of skeletal muscle toxicity, including rhabdomyolysis.   
 Respiratory Drugs                           salmeterol                                                         
 Urological Drugs                                                  fesoterodine, sildenafil, solifenacin, tadalafil, tolterodine, vardenafil  Vardenafil: A single dose of 5 mg of vardenafil should not be exceeded when coadministered with ketoconazole.   
 Other                 colchicine, in subjects with renal or hepatic impairment; tolvaptan  colchicine            alcohol, cinacalcet    Colchicine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of colchicine when coadministered with NIZORAL(r) Tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal adverse events.  Tolvaptan: Ketoconazole 200 mg administered with tolvaptan increased tolvaptan exposure by 5-fold. Larger doses would be expected to produce larger increases in tolvaptan exposure. There is not adequate experience to define the dose adjustment that would be needed to allow safe use of tolvaptan with strong CYP3A inhibitors such as ketoconazole.  Alcohol: Exceptional cases have been reported of a disulfiram-like reaction to alcohol, characterized by flushing, rash, peripheral edema, nausea and headache. All symptoms completely resolved within a few hours.    
              Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility
 

  Ketoconazole did not show any signs of mutagenic potential when evaluated using the dominant lethal mutation test or the Ames Salmonella  microsomal activator assay. Ketoconazole was not carcinogenic in an 18-month, oral study in Swiss albino mice or a 24-month oral carcinogenicity study in Wistar rats at dose levels of 5, 20 and 80 mg/kg/day. The high dose in these studies was approximately 1* (mouse) or 2* (rat) the clinical dose in humans based on a mg/m  2  comparison.



    Pregnancy



   Teratogenic effects



   Pregnancy Category C



  Ketoconazole has been shown to be teratogenic (syndactylia and oligodactylia) in the rat when given in the diet at 80 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum recommended human dose, based on body surface area comparisons). However, these effects may be related to maternal toxicity, evidence of which also was seen at this and higher dose levels.



 There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. NIZORAL  (r)  Tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.



    Nonteratogenic Effects



  Ketoconazole has also been found to be embryotoxic in the rat when given in the diet at doses higher than 80 mg/kg during the first trimester of gestation.



 In addition, dystocia (difficult labor) was noted in rats administered oral ketoconazole during the third trimester of gestation. This occurred when ketoconazole was administered at doses higher than 10 mg/kg (about one fourth the maximum human dose, based on body surface area comparison).



    Nursing Mothers



  Ketoconazole has been shown to be excreted in the milk. Mothers who are under treatment with NIZORAL  (r)  Tablets should not breast feed.



    Pediatric Use



  NIZORAL  (r)  Tablets have not been systematically studied in children of any age, and essentially no information is available on children under 2 years. NIZORAL  (r)  Tablets should not be used in pediatric patients unless the potential benefit outweighs the risks.
</Section>
    <Section id="S4" name="warnings">    WARNINGS



  NIZORAL  (r)  Tablets should be used only when other effective antifungal therapy is not available or tolerated and the potential benefits are considered to outweigh the potential risks.



    Hepatotoxicity



  Serious hepatotoxicity, including cases with a fatal outcome or requiring liver transplantation, has occurred with the use of oral ketoconazole. Some patients had no obvious risk factors for liver disease. Serious hepatotoxicity was reported both by patients receiving high doses for short treatment durations and by patients receiving low doses for long durations.



 The hepatic injury has usually, but not always, been reversible upon discontinuation of NIZORAL  (r)  Tablets treatment. Cases of hepatitis have been reported in children.



 At baseline, obtain laboratory tests (such as SGGT, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, total bilirubin (TBL), Prothrombin Time (PT), International Normalization Ratio (INR), and testing for viral hepatitides). Patients should be advised against alcohol consumption while on treatment. If possible, use of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs should be avoided in patients receiving NIZORAL  (r)  Tablets.



 Prompt recognition of liver injury is essential. During the course of treatment, serum ALT should be monitored weekly for the duration of treatment. If ALT values increase to a level above the upper limit of normal or 30 percent above baseline, or if the patient develops symptoms, ketoconazole treatment should be interrupted and a full set of liver tests should be obtained. Liver tests should be repeated to ensure normalization of values. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with restarting oral ketoconazole (rechallenge). If it is decided to restart oral ketoconazole, monitor the patient frequently to detect any recurring liver injury from the drug.



    QT Prolongation and Drug Interactions Leading to QT Prolongation



  Ketoconazole can prolong the QT interval. Co-administration of the following drugs with ketoconazole is contraindicated: dofetilide, quinidine, pimozide, cisapride, methadone, disopyramide, dronedarone, ranolazine. Ketoconazole can cause elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs which may prolong the QT interval, sometimes resulting in life-threatening ventricular dysrhythmias such as torsades de pointes.



    Adrenal Insufficiency



  NIZORAL  (r)  Tablets decrease adrenal corticosteroid secretion at doses of 400 mg and higher. This effect is not shared with other azoles. The recommended dose of 200 mg - 400 mg daily should not be exceeded.



 Adrenal function should be monitored in patients with adrenal insufficiency or with borderline adrenal function and in patients under prolonged periods of stress (major surgery, intensive care, etc.).



    Adverse Reactions Associated with Unapproved Uses



  Ketoconazole has been used in high doses for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer and for Cushing's syndrome when other treatment options have failed. The safety and effectiveness of ketoconazole have not been established in these settings and the use of ketoconazole for these indications is not approved by FDA.



 In a clinical trial involving 350 patients with metastatic prostatic cancer, eleven deaths were reported within two weeks of starting treatment with high doses of ketoconazole tablets (1200 mg/day). It is not possible to ascertain from the information available whether death was related to ketoconazole therapy or adrenal insufficiency in these patients with serious underlying disease.



    Hypersensitivity



  Anaphylaxis has been reported after the first dose. Several cases of hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria have also been reported.
