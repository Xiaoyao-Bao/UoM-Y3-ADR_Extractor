  The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:

 *  Hematologic Toxicity [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ] . 
 *  Acute Renal Failure [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2 )  ] . 
 *  Impairment of Fertility [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ] . 
 *  Fetal Toxicity [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.4)  ] . 
 *  Mutagenesis and Carcinogenesis [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.5)  ] . 
    The most common adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities reported in at least one indication by greater than or equal to 20% of adult patients treated with VALCYTE tablets are diarrhea, pyrexia, fatigue, nausea, tremor, neutropenia, anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, headache, insomnia, urinary tract infection, and vomiting. The most common reported adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities reported in greater than or equal to 20% of pediatric solid organ transplant recipients treated with VALCYTE for oral solution or tablets are diarrhea, pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, vomiting, neutropenia, leukopenia, and headache.

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect rates observed in practice.

 Valganciclovir, a prodrug of ganciclovir, is rapidly converted to ganciclovir after oral administration. Adverse reactions known to be associated with ganciclovir usage can therefore be expected to occur with VALCYTE.

     Adverse Reactions in Adults:  

     Treatment of CMV Retinitis in AIDS Patients:  In a clinical study for the treatment of CMV retinitis in HIV-infected patients, the adverse reactions reported by patients receiving VALCYTE tablets (n=79) or intravenous ganciclovir (n=79) for 28 days of randomized therapy (21 days induction dose and 7 days maintenance dose), respectively, included diarrhea (16%, 10%), nausea (8%, 14%), and headache (9%, 5%) . The incidence of adverse reactions was similar between the group who received VALCYTE tablets and the group who received intravenous ganciclovir. The frequencies of neutropenia (ANC less than 500/uL) were 11% for patients receiving VALCYTE tablets compared with 13% for patients receiving intravenous ganciclovir. Anemia (Hgb less than 8 g/dL) occurred in 8% of patients in each group. Other laboratory abnormalities occurred with similar frequencies in the two groups.

 Adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities are available for 370 patients who received maintenance therapy with VALCYTE tablets 900 mg once daily in two open-label clinical trials. Approximately 252 (68%) of these patients received VALCYTE tablets for more than nine months (maximum duration was 36 months).  Table 3  and  Table 4  show pooled selected adverse reactions and abnormal laboratory values from these patients.

     Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients:  

 VALCYTE for oral solution and tablets have been studied in 179 pediatric solid organ transplant patients who were at risk for developing CMV disease (aged 3 weeks to 16 years) and in 24 neonates with symptomatic congenital CMV disease (aged 8 to 34 days), with duration of ganciclovir exposure ranging from 2 to 200 days  [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.4)  ,  Clinical Studies (14.2)  ]  .

     Prevention of CMV Disease in Pediatric Solid Organ Transplant Patients:  The most frequently reported adverse reactions (greater than 10% of patients), regardless of seriousness, in pediatric solid organ transplant patients taking VALCYTE until Day 100 post-transplant were diarrhea, pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infection, vomiting, anemia, neutropenia, constipation and nausea. The most frequently reported adverse reactions (greater than 10% of patients) in pediatric kidney transplant patients treated with valganciclovir until Day 200 post-transplant were upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, diarrhea, leukopenia, neutropenia, headache, abdominal pain, tremor, pyrexia, anemia, blood creatinine increased, vomiting, and hematuria.

 In general, the safety profile was similar in pediatric patients compared to that observed in adult patients. However, the rates of certain adverse reactions, and laboratory abnormalities, such as upper respiratory tract infection, pyrexia, nasopharyngitis, anemia, and abdominal pain were reported more frequently in pediatric patients than in adults  [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.4)  ,  Clinical Studies (14.2)  ].  Neutropenia was reported with higher incidence in the two pediatric studies as compared to adults, but there was no correlation between neutropenia and infections observed in the pediatric population.

 The overall safety profile of VALCYTE was similar with the extension of prophylaxis until Day 200 post-transplant in high risk pediatric kidney transplant patients. However, the incidence of severe neutropenia (ANC&lt;500/uL) was higher in pediatric kidney transplant patients treated with VALCYTE until Day 200 (17/57, 30%) compared to pediatric kidney transplant patients treated until Day 100 (3/63, 5%). There were no differences in the incidence of severe (Grade 4) anemia or thrombocytopenia in patients treated 100 or 200 days with VALCYTE.

   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of VALCYTE. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. As VALCYTE is rapidly and extensively converted to ganciclovir, any adverse reactions associated with ganciclovir might also occur with valganciclovir.

 *  -  Anaphylactic reactions 
 *  -  Agranulocytosis 
 *  -  Granulocytopenia 
    In general, the adverse reactions reported during the postmarketing use of VALCYTE were similar to those identified during the clinical trials.

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings and precautions">   5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

   EXCERPT:    *  Acute renal failure: Acute renal failure may occur in elderly patients (with or without reduced renal function), patients who receive concomitant nephrotoxic drugs, or inadequately hydrated patients. Use with caution in elderly patients or those taking nephrotoxic drugs, reduce dosage in patients with renal impairment, and monitor renal function (  2.5  ,  8.5  ,  8.6  ). 
    
 

   5.1 Hematologic Toxicity

  Severe leukopenia, neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, and bone marrow failure including aplastic anemia have been reported in patients treated with VALCYTE or ganciclovir. VALCYTE should be avoided if the absolute neutrophil count is less than 500 cells/uL, the platelet count is less than 25,000/uL, or the hemoglobin is less than 8 g/dL. VALCYTE should also be used with caution in patients with pre-existing cytopenias and in patients receiving myelosuppressive drugs or irradiation. Cytopenia may occur at any time during treatment and may worsen with continued dosing. Cell counts usually begin to recover within 3 to 7 days after discontinuing drug. In patients with severe leukopenia, neutropenia, anemia and/or thrombocytopenia, treatment with hematopoietic growth factors may be considered.

 Due to the frequency of neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia in patients receiving VALCYTE [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  , complete blood counts with differential and platelet counts should be performed frequently, especially in patients with renal impairment and in patients in whom ganciclovir or other nucleoside analogues have previously resulted in leukopenia, or in whom neutrophil counts are less than 1000 cells/uL at the beginning of treatment. Increased monitoring for cytopenias may be warranted if therapy with oral ganciclovir is changed to VALCYTE, because of increased plasma concentrations of ganciclovir after VALCYTE administration [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  .

    5.2 Acute Renal Failure

  Acute renal failure may occur in:

 *  Elderly patients with or without reduced renal function. Caution should be exercised when administering VALCYTE to geriatric patients, and dosage reduction is recommended for those with impaired renal function [see  Dosage and Administration (2.5)  ,  Use in Specific Populations (8.5  ,  8.6)  ] . 
 *  Patients receiving potential nephrotoxic drugs. Caution should be exercised when administering VALCYTE to patients receiving potential nephrotoxic drugs. 
 *  Patients without adequate hydration. Adequate hydration should be maintained for all patients. 
       5.3 Impairment of Fertility
 

  Based on animal data with ganciclovir, VALCYTE at the recommended human doses may cause temporary or permanent inhibition of spermatogenesis in males, and may cause suppression of fertility in females. Advise patients that fertility may be impaired with use of VALCYTE [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1  ,  8.3)  ,  Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)  ]  .

    5.4 Fetal Toxicity

  Ganciclovir may cause fetal toxicity when administered to pregnant women based on findings in animal studies. When given to pregnant rabbits at dosages resulting in 2-times the human exposure (based on AUC), ganciclovir caused malformations in multiple organs of the fetuses. Maternal and fetal toxicity were also observed in pregnant mice and rabbits. Therefore, VALCYTE has the potential to cause birth defects. Pregnancy should be avoided in female patients taking VALCYTE and in females with male partners taking VALCYTE. Females of reproductive potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 30 days following treatment with VALCYTE because of the potential risk to the fetus. Similarly, males should be advised to use condoms during and for at least 90 days following treatment with VALCYTE [see  Dosage and Administration (2.6)  ,  Use in Specific Populations (8.1  ,  8.3)  ,  Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)  ].  

    5.5 Mutagenesis and Carcinogenesis

  Animal data indicate that ganciclovir is mutagenic and carcinogenic. VALCYTE should therefore be considered a potential carcinogen in humans [see  Dosage and Administration (2.6)  ,  Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)  ]  .
