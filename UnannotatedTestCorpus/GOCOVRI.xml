  6.1. Clinical Trial Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



   Placebo-Controlled Trials  



 GOCOVRI was evaluated in two double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy trials of similar design and population: Study 1 (123 patients) and Study 2 (75 patients). The study population was approximately 56% male and 94% white, with a mean age of 65 years (age range from 34 years to 82 years). The mean duration of levodopa-induced dyskinesia was 4 years (range 0.1 to 14 years). Active treatment started at 137 mg once daily for one week, followed by a dose increase to 274 mg once daily. The treatment duration was 25 weeks for Study 1 and 13 weeks for Study 2. Of the 100 patients in the safety population described below, 39 patients were treated with GOCOVRI for 24 weeks. The safety data for these trials were pooled.



 The most common adverse reactions reported in &gt;10% of GOCOVRI-treated patients and more frequently than on placebo were: hallucination, dizziness, dry mouth, peripheral edema, constipation, falls, and orthostatic hypotension.



 The overall rate of discontinuation because of adverse reactions for GOCOVRI-treated patients was 20%, compared to 8% for placebo-treated patients. Adverse reactions that led to treatment discontinuation in at least 2% of patients were hallucination (8% GOCOVRI vs. 0% placebo), dry mouth (3% GOCOVRI vs. 0% placebo), peripheral edema (3% GOCOVRI vs. 0% placebo), blurred vision (GOCOVRI 3% vs. 0% placebo), postural dizziness and syncope (GOCOVRI 2% vs. 0% placebo), abnormal dreams (GOCOVRI 2% vs. 1% placebo), dysphagia (GOCOVRI 2% vs. 0% placebo), and gait disturbance (GOCOVRI 2% vs. 0% placebo).

   Difference in the Frequency of Adverse Reactions by Gender  



 Adverse reactions reported more frequently in women treated with 274 mg of GOCOVRI (n=46), compared to men (n=54), were: dry mouth (22% women, 11% men), nausea (13% women, 4% men), livedo reticularis (13% women, 0% men), abnormal dreams (9% women, 0% men) and cataracts (7% women, 0% men).



 Men treated with 274 mg of GOCOVRI reported the following adverse reactions more frequently than women: dizziness (20% men, 11% women), peripheral edema (19% men, 11% women), anxiety (11% men, 2% women), orthostatic hypotension (7% men, 2% women) and gait disturbance (6% men, 0% women).



   Difference in the Frequency of Adverse Reactions by Age  



 Hallucinations (visual or auditory) were reported in 31% of GOCOVRI-treated patients age 65 years and over (n=52), compared to 10% in patients below the age of 65 years (n=48). Falls were reported in 17% of GOCOVRI-treated patients age 65 and over, compared to 8% of patients below age 65. Orthostatic hypotension was reported in 8% of patients age 65 and over, compared to 2% of patients below age 65.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *   Falling Asleep During Activities of Daily Living : Advise patients prior to treatment; ordinarily discontinue if occurs (  5.1  ) 
 *   Suicidality and Depression : Monitor patients for depressed mood, depression, or suicidal ideation or behavior (  5.2  ) 
 *   Hallucinations/Psychotic Behavior: Patients with major psychotic disorder should ordinarily not be treated with GOCOVRI; observe patients for the occurrence of hallucinations throughout treatment, especially at initiation and after dose increases (  5.3  ) 
 *   Dizziness and Orthostatic Hypotension : Monitor patients for dizziness and orthostatic hypotension, especially after starting GOCOVRI or increasing the dose (  5.4  ) 
 *   Withdrawal-Emergent Hyperpyrexia and Confusion : Avoid sudden discontinuation (  5.5  ) 
 *   Impulse Control/Compulsive Behaviors : Ask patients about increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending or other urges; consider dose reduction or discontinuation if occurs (  5.6  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Falling Asleep During Activities of Daily Living and Somnolence



  Patients treated for Parkinson's disease have reported falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living, including the operation of motor vehicles, which sometimes has resulted in accidents. Patients may not perceive warning signs, such as excessive drowsiness, or they may report feeling alert immediately prior to the event. In controlled clinical trials, somnolence and fatigue were reported as adverse reactions in 4% of patients treated with GOCOVRI 274 mg and 1% for placebo.



 Before initiating treatment with GOCOVRI, advise patients of the potential to develop drowsiness and specifically ask about factors that may increase the risk for somnolence with GOCOVRI, such as concomitant sedating medications or the presence of a sleep disorder. If a patient develops daytime sleepiness or episodes of falling asleep during activities that require full attention (e.g., driving a motor vehicle, conversations, eating), GOCOVRI should ordinarily be discontinued.



 If a decision is made to continue GOCOVRI, patients should be advised not to drive and to avoid other potentially dangerous activities. There is insufficient information to establish that dose reduction will eliminate episodes of falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living or daytime somnolence.



    5.2 Suicidality and Depression



  In controlled clinical trials, suicidal ideation or suicide attempt was reported in 2% of GOCOVRI-treated patients and 0% of placebo-treated patients. Depression or depressed mood was reported in 6% of GOCOVRI-treated patients and 1% of placebo-treated patients. Confusional state was reported in 3% of GOCOVRI-treated patients and 2% of placebo-treated patients. Apathy was reported in 2% of GOCOVRI-treated patients and 0% of placebo-treated patients.



 Monitor patients for depression, including suicidal ideation or behavior. Prescribers should consider whether the benefits outweigh the risks of treatment with GOCOVRI in patients with a history of suicidality or depression.



    5.3 Hallucinations/Psychotic Behavior



  Patients with a major psychotic disorder should ordinarily not be treated with GOCOVRI because of the risk of exacerbating psychosis. In controlled trials, the incidence of patients who experienced visual hallucination, auditory hallucination, delusions, illusions, or paranoia was 25% in patients treated with GOCOVRI 274 mg and 3% in placebo-treated patients. Hallucinations caused discontinuation of treatment in 8% of GOCOVRI-treated patients and 0% of placebo-treated patients.



 Observe patients for the occurrence of hallucinations throughout treatment, especially at initiation and after dose increases.



    5.4 Dizziness and Orthostatic Hypotension



  In controlled clinical trials, 29% of GOCOVRI-treated patients and 2% of placebo-treated patients experienced dizziness, syncope, orthostatic hypotension, presyncope, postural dizziness or hypotension. In GOCOVRI-treated patients, 3% discontinued study treatment because of dizziness, postural dizziness, or syncope, compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients.



 Monitor patients for dizziness and orthostatic hypotension, especially after starting GOCOVRI or increasing the dose. Concomitant use of alcohol when using GOCOVRI is not recommended [ see Drug Interactions (  7.4  )].  



    5.5 Withdrawal-Emergent Hyperpyrexia and Confusion



  A symptom complex resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome (characterized by elevated temperature, muscular rigidity, altered consciousness, and autonomic instability), with no other obvious etiology, has been reported in association with rapid dose reduction, withdrawal of, or changes in drugs that increase central dopaminergic tone.



 Abrupt discontinuation of GOCOVRI may cause an increase in the symptoms of Parkinson's disease or cause delirium, agitation, delusions, hallucinations, paranoid reaction, stupor, anxiety, depression, or slurred speech. It is recommended to avoid sudden discontinuation of GOCOVRI [ see Dosing Information (  2.4  )].  



    5.6 Impulse Control/Compulsive Behaviors



  Patients can experience intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money, binge eating, and/or other intense urges, and the inability to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications, including GOCOVRI, that increase central dopaminergic tone. In some cases, these urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal, it is important for prescribers to specifically ask patients or their caregivers about the development of new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending, or other urges while being treated with GOCOVRI. Consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges while taking GOCOVRI.
