  6.1 Clinical Studies Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.In double-blind clinical trials involving GLUCOVANCE as initial therapy or as second-line therapy, a total of 642 patients received GLUCOVANCE, 312 received metformin therapy, 324 received glyburide therapy, and 161 received placebo. The percent of patients reporting events and types of adverse events reported in clinical trials of GLUCOVANCE (all strengths) as initial therapy and second-line therapy are listed in Table 1.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: LACTIC ACIDOSIS

  WARNING: LACTIC ACIDOSIS

  Postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis have resulted in death, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias. The onset of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is often subtle, accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (&gt;5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; and metformin plasma levels generally &gt;5 mcg/mL [see   Warnings and Precautions   (  5.1  )].Risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (e.g., carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate), age 65 years old or greater, having a radiological study with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states (e.g., acute congestive heart failure), excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment.Steps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis in these high risk groups are provided [see   Dosage and Administration   (  2.3  ),   Contraindications   (  4  ) and   Warnings and Precautions   (  5.1  )].If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, immediately discontinue GLUCOVANCE and institute general supportive measures in a hospital setting. Prompt hemodialysis is recommended [see   Warnings and Precautions   (  5.1  )].

   5.1 Lactic Acidosis



  There have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (&gt;5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally &gt;5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.



 If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of GLUCOVANCE. In GLUCOVANCE treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.



 Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue GLUCOVANCE and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.



 For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:



 *  Renal Impairment-The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see  Dosage and Administration  (  2.1  ),  Clinical Pharmacology  (  12.3  )]: 
   *  Before initiating GLUCOVANCE, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). 
 *  GLUCOVANCE is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m  2  [see  CONTRAINDICATIONS  (  4  )]. 
 *  Initiation of GLUCOVANCE is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30-45 mL/min/1.73 m  2  . 
 *  Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patient taking GLUCOVANCE. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. 
 *  In patients taking GLUCOVANCE whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m  2  , assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.  
   *   Drug interactions -The concomitant use of GLUCOVANCE with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients. 
 *   Age 65 or Greater -The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients. 
 *   Radiologic studies with contrast -Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop GLUCOVANCE at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m  2  ; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure, or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Reevaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart GLUCOVANCE if renal function is stable. 
 *   Surgery and other procedures -Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. GLUCOVANCE should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake. 
 *   Hypoxic states -Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue GLUCOVANCE. 
 *   Excessive Alcohol intake -Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake, acute or chronic, while receiving GLUCOVANCE. 
 *   Hepatic impairment -Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of GLUCOVANCE in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. 
       5.2 Hypoglycemia
 

  All sulfonylurea-containing products, including GLUCOVANCE, are capable of producing hypoglycemia or hypoglycemic symptoms, therefore, proper patient selection, dosing, and instructions are important to avoid potential hypoglycemic episodes. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased when caloric intake is deficient, when strenuous exercise is not compensated by caloric supplementation, or during concomitant use with other glucose-lowering agents or ethanol. Renal or hepatic insufficiency may cause elevated drug levels of both glyburide and metformin, and the hepatic insufficiency may also diminish gluconeogenic capacity, both of which increase the risk of hypoglycemic reactions. Elderly, debilitated, or malnourished patients and those with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency or alcohol intoxication are particularly susceptible to hypoglycemic effects. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly and people who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking drugs.



    5.3 Cardiovascular Mortality



   The administration of oral hypoglycemic drugs has been reported to be associated with increased cardiovascular mortality as compared to treatment with diet alone or diet plus insulin. This warning is based on the study conducted by the University Group Diabetes Program (UGDP), a long-term prospective clinical trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of glucose-lowering drugs in preventing or delaying vascular complications in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes. The study involved 823 patients who were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups (Diabetes 19 (Suppl. 2):747-830, 1970).  UGDP reported that patients treated for 5 to 8 years with diet plus a fixed dose of tolbutamide (1.5 g per day) had a rate of cardiovascular mortality approximately 21/2 times that of patients treated with diet alone. A significant increase in total mortality was not observed, but the use of tolbutamide was discontinued based on the increase in cardiovascular mortality, thus limiting the opportunity for the study to show an increase in overall mortality. Despite controversy regarding the interpretation of these results, the findings of the UGDP study provide an adequate basis for this warning. The patient should be informed of the potential risks and benefits of glyburide and of alternative modes of therapy.Although only 1 drug in the sulfonylurea class (tolbutamide) was included in this study, it is prudent from a safety standpoint to consider that this warning may also apply to other hypoglycemic drugs in this class, in view of their close similarities in mode of action and chemical structure.
 

    5.4 Hemolytic Anemia



  Treatment of patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency with sulfonylurea agents can lead to hemolytic anemia. Because GLUCOVANCE contains a sulfonylurea agent (glyburide), caution should be used in patients with G6PD deficiency and a non-sulfonylurea alternative should be considered. In postmarketing reports, hemolytic anemia has also been reported in patients who did not have known G6PD deficiency.



    5.5 Vitamin B12Deficiency



  In metformin clinical trials of 29 weeks duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12levels, was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B12supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on GLUCOVANCE and manage any abnormalities (see  Adverse Reactions  (  6.1  ) ).



    5.6 Macrovascular Outcomes



  There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with GLUCOVANCE.
