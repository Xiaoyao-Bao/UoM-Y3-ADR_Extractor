 Adverse events were primarily mild in intensity and generally resolved without medical treatment or discontinuation of  VANIQA      (r)    . Only 2% of subjects discontinued studies due to an adverse event related to use of  VANIQA      (r)    .



     Laboratory Test Abnormalities  

  No laboratory test abnormalities have been consistently found to be associated with  VANIQA      (r)    . In an open-label study, some patients showed an increase in their transaminases; however, the clinical significance of these findings is not known.

     Information for Patients  



  Patients using VANIQA     (r)    should receive the following information and instructions:



 *  This medication is not a depilatory, but rather appears to retard hair growth to improve the condition and the patient's appearance. Patients will likely need to continue using a hair removal method (e.g., shaving, plucking, etc.) in conjunction with VANIQA    (r)   (eflornithine hydrochloride) cream, 13.9%. 
 *  Onset of improvement was seen after as little as 4-8 weeks of treatment in the 24-week clinical trials. The condition may return to pretreatment levels 8 weeks after discontinuing treatment. 
 *  If skin irritation or intolerance develops, direct the patient to temporarily reduce the frequency of application (e.g., once a day). If irritation continues, the patient should discontinue use of the product. 
    Refer to the Patient Information Leaflet for additional important information and instructions.
