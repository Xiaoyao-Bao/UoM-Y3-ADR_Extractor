    6.1  Clinical Trial Experience  

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 The safety of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets was evaluated in a total of 2011 patients in open-label and controlled clinical trials.  The clinical trials enrolled of patients with moderate to severe chronic non-malignant pain, cancer pain, and post surgical pain.  The most common serious adverse events reported with administration of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets were chest pain, pneumonia and vomiting.



 Tables 1 and 2 list the most frequently occurring adverse reactions (in at least 5% of patients) from the placebo-controlled trials in patients with low back pain.

         The common (&gt;=1% to &lt;10%) adverse drug reactions reported at least once by patients treated with oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in the clinical trials organized by MedDRA's (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities) System Organ Class and not represented in Table 1 were:
 

   Eye disorders:  vision blurred



   Gastrointestinal disorders:  diarrhea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia



   General disorders and administration site conditions  :    dry mouth, appetite decreased, fatigue, lethargy, weakness, pyrexia, dehydration, weight decreased, edema



   Nervous system disorders:  insomnia 



   Psychiatricdisorders:  anxiety, confusion, disorientation, restlessness, nervousness, depression



   Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders:  dyspnea



   Vascular disorders:  flushing and hypertension



 Otherless commonadverse reactions known with opioid treatment that were seen &lt;1% in the oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets trials include the following:  Bradycardia, palpitation, syncope, tachycardia, postural hypotension, miosis,  abdominal distention, ileus, hot flashes, allergic reactions, hypersensitivity, urticaria, oxygen saturation decreased, central nervous system depression, depressed level of consciousness, agitation, dysphoria, euphoric mood, hallucination, mental status changes, difficult micturition, urinary retention, hypoxia, respiratory depression, respiratory distress, clamminess, dermatitis, hypotension.



     6.2  Post-marketing Experience  

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of opioids. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Nervous system disorder    :    amnesia, convulsion, memory impairment



   Serotonin syndrome:  Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs.



   Adrenal insufficiency:  Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use.



   Anaphylaxis:  Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in OPANA ER



   Androgen deficiency:  Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with chronic use of opioids  [see Clinical Pharmacology (  12.2  )]  .

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: ADDICTION, ABUSE, AND MISUSE; RISK EVALUATION AND MITIGATION STRATEGY (REMS); LIFE-THREATENING RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION; ACCIDENTAL INGESTION; NEONATAL OPIOID WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME;INTERACTION WITH ALCOHOL; and RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH BENZODIAZEPINES OR OTHER CNS DEPRESSANTS

    WARNING: ADDICTION, ABUSE, AND MISUSE; RISK EVALUATION AND MITIGATION STRATEGY (REMS); LIFE-THREATENING RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION; ACCIDENTAL INGESTION; NEONATAL OPIOID WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME;INTERACTION WITH ALCOHOL; and RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH BENZODIAZEPINES OR OTHER CNS DEPRESSANTS  

      Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse    



   OPANA ER exposes patients and other users to the risks of opioid addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death.  Assess each patient's risk prior to prescribing OPANA ER, and monitor all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors and conditions [  see Warnings and Precautions (      5.1      )  ].  



     Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS):    



     To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a REMS for these products [  see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )  ]. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to    



 *  complete a REMS-compliant education program, 
 *  counsel patients and/or their caregivers, with every prescription, on safe use, serious risks, storage, and disposal            of these products, 
 *  emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide every time it is        provided by their pharmacist, and 
 *  consider other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety. 
        Life-threatening Respiratory Depression    
 

   Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of OPANA ER.  Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of OPANA ER or following a dose increase. Instruct patients to swallow OPANA ER tablets whole; crushing, chewing, or dissolving OPANA ER tablets can cause rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxymorphone [  see Warnings and Precautions (      5.3      )  ].  



     Accidental Ingestion    



   Accidental ingestion of even one dose of OPANA ER, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of oxymorphone [  see Warnings and Precautions (      5.3      )  ].  



     Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome    



   Prolonged use of OPANA ER during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [  see Warnings and Precautions (      5.4      )  ].  



     Interaction with Alcohol    



   Instruct patients not to consume alcoholic beverages or use prescription or non-prescription products that contain alcohol while taking OPANA ER. The co-ingestion of alcohol with OPANA ER may result in increased plasma levels and a potentially fatal overdose of oxymorphone [  see Warnings and Precautions (      5.5      )  ].  



     Risks From Concomitant Use With Benzodiazepines Or Other CNS Depressants    



   Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death [  see Warnings and Precautions (      5.5  ), Drug Interactions (    7        )  ].  



 *  Reserve concomitant prescribing of OPANA ER and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. 
 *  Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. 
 *  Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. 
      EXCERPT:     WARNING: ADDICTION, ABUSE,  AND MISUSE; RISK EVALUATION AND MITIGATION STRATEGY (REMS); LIFE-THREATENING RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION; ACCIDENTAL INGESTION; NEONATAL OPIOID WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME; INTERACTION WITH ALCOHOL; and RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH BENZODIAZEPINES AND OTHER CNS DEPRESSANTS

 *  OPANA ER exposes users to risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess patient's risk before prescribing and monitor regularly for these behaviors and conditions. (5.1) 
 *  To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. (5.2) 
 *  Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur. Monitor closely, especially upon initiation or following a dose increase.  Instruct patients to swallow OPANA ER tablets whole to avoid exposure to a potentially fatal dose of oxymorphone. (5.3) 
 *  Accidental ingestion of OPANA ER, especially by children, can result in fatal overdose of oxymorphone. (5.3) 
 *  Prolonged use of OPANA ER during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available (5.4). 
 *  Instruct patients not to consume alcohol or any product containing alcohol while taking OPANA ER because co-ingestion can result in fatal plasma oxymorphone levels. (5.5) 
 *  Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate; limit dosages and durations to the minimum required; and follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.

    5.1  Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Potential  



  OPANA ER contains oxymorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance.  As an opioid, OPANA ER exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse .  Because extended-release products such as OPANA ER deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of oxymorphone present [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (  9  )]  .



 Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed OPANA ER.  Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused.



 Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing OPANA ER, and monitor all patients receiving OPANA ER for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression).  The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient.  Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as OPANA ER, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of OPANA ER along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse.



 Abuse or misuse of OPANA ER by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product will result in the uncontrolled delivery of the oxymorphone and can result in overdose and death [see Overdosage (  10  )]  .



 Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion.  Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing OPANA ER.  Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see Patient Counseling Information (  17  )]  .  Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 



     5.2 Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)  



   To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to do all of the following:  



 *   Complete a REMS-compliant education program offered by an accredited provider of continuing education (CE) or another education program that includes all the elements of the FDA Education Blueprint for Health Care Providers Involved in the Management or Support of Patients with Pain.  
 *   Discuss the safe use, serious risks, and proper storage and disposal of opioid analgesics with patients and/or their caregivers every time these medicines are prescribed. The Patient Counseling Guide (PCG) can be obtained at this link:   www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSPCG  .  
 *   Emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide that they will receive from their pharmacist every time an opioid analgesic is dispensed to them.  
 *   Consider using other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety, such as patient-prescriber agreements that reinforce patient-prescriber responsibilities.  
     To obtain further information on the opioid analgesic REMS and for a list of accredited REMS CME/CE, call 1-800-503-0784, or log on to  www.opioidanalgesicrems.com  . The FDA Blueprint can be found at  www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSBlueprint  .  
 

     5.3  Life Threatening Respiratory Depression  



  Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended.  Respiratory depression from opioid use, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see Overdosage (  10  )]  . Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.



 While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of OPANA ER, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within 24-72 hours of initiating therapy with and following dose increases of OPANA ER.



 To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of OPANA ER are essential [see Dosage and Administration (  2  )]  . Overestimating the OPANA ER dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in fatal overdose with the first dose.



 Accidental ingestion of even one dose of OPANA ER, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of oxymorphone.



     5.4  Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome  



  Prolonged use of OPANA ER during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly.  Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available.



     5.5  Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants   



  Patients must not consume alcoholic beverages or prescription or non-prescription products containing alcohol while on OPANA ER therapy. The co-ingestion of alcohol with OPANA ER may result in increased plasma levels and a potentially fatal overdose of oxymorphone [see Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )].  



 Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of OPANA ER with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.



 Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions (  7  )]  .



 If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.



 Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when OPANA ER is used with benzodiazepine or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [see Drug Interactions (  7  ) and Patient Counseling Information (  17  )]  .



     5.6  Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients  



  The use of OPANA ER in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated.



  Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease:  OPANA ER-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive, including apnea even at recommended dosages of OPANA ER [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  )]  . 



  Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients:  Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  )].  



 Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating OPANA ER and when OPANA ER is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  )]  .  Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients 



     5.7  Anaphylaxis, Angioedema, and Other Hypersensitivity Reactions  



  Potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema, have occurred in patients treated with OPANA ER in the postmarket setting. The most commonly described clinical features in these reports were swelling of the face, eyes, mouth, lips, tongue, hands, and/or throat; dyspnea; hives, pruritus, and/or rash; and nausea/vomiting. If anaphylaxis or other hypersensitivity occurs, stop administration of OPANA ER immediately, discontinue OPANA ER permanently, and do not rechallenge with any formulation of oxymorphone. Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if they experience any symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction [see Patient Counseling Information (  17  )]  . 



     5.8  Adrenal Insufficiency  



  Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. 



     5.9  Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment  



  A study of OPANA ER in patients with hepatic disease indicated greater plasma concentrations than those with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )]  .  OPANA ER is contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. In patients with mild hepatic impairment reduce the starting dose to the lowest dose and monitor for signs of respiratory and central nervous system depression [see Dosage and Administration (  2.5  )]  .



     5.10  Severe Hypotension  



  OPANA ER may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g. phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (  7  )]  .  Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of OPANA ER. In patients with circulatory shock, OPANA ER may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of OPANA ER in patients with circulatory shock.



     5.11  Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness  



  In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), OPANA ER may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2retention can further increase intracranial pressure .  Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with OPANA ER.



 Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury.  Avoid the use of OPANA ER in patients with impaired consciousness or coma.



     5.12  Difficulty in Swallowing and Risk for Obstruction in Patients at Risk for a Small Gastrointestinal Lumen  



  There have been post-marketing reports of difficulty in swallowing OPANA ER tablets. These reports included choking, gagging, regurgitation and tablets stuck in the throat. Instruct patients not to pre-soak, lick or otherwise wet OPANA ER tablets prior to placing in the mouth, and to take one tablet at a time with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth.



 There have been rare post-marketing reports of cases of intestinal obstruction, some of which have required medical intervention to remove the tablet. Patients with underlying GI disorders such as esophageal cancer or colon cancer with a small gastrointestinal lumen are at greater risk of developing these complications. Consider use of an alternative analgesic in patients who have difficulty swallowing and patients at risk for underlying GI disorders resulting in a small gastrointestinal lumen. 



     5.13  Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions  



  OPANA ER is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus.



 The oxymorphone in OPANA ER may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. 



     5.14  Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders  



  The oxymorphone in OPANA ER may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures.  Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during OPANA ER therapy. 



     5.15  Withdrawal  



  Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) and partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including OPANA ER.  In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms.



 When discontinuing OPANA ER, gradually taper the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (  2.4  )]  .  Do not abruptly discontinue OPANA ER. 



     5.16  Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery  



  OPANA ER may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery.  Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of OPANA ER and know how they will react to the medication.
