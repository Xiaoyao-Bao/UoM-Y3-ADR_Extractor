   General



  Eurax should not be applied in the eyes or mouth because it may cause irritation. It should not be applied to acutely inflamed skin or raw or weeping surfaces until the acute inflammation has subsided.



    Information for Patients



  See   DIRECTIONS FOR PATIENTS WITH SCABIES    .



    Drug Interactions



  None known.



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility



  Long-term carcinogenicity studies in animals have not been conducted.



    Pregnancy (Category C)



  Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Eurax. It is also not known whether Eurax can cause fetal harm when applied topically to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Eurax should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.



    Pediatric Use



  Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.



    Geriatric Use



  Clinical studies with Eurax (crotamiton USP) Lotion/Cream did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.
