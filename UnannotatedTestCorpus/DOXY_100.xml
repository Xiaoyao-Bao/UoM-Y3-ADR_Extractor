  Gastrointestinal

  Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, glossitis, dysphagia, enterocolitis and inflammatory lesions (with monilial overgrowth) in the anogenital region.  Hepatotoxicity has been reported rarely.  These reactions have been caused by both the oral and parenteral administration of tetracyclines.



   Skin

  Maculopapular and erythematous rashes.  Exfoliative dermatitis has been reported but is uncommon.  Photosensitivity is discussed above (see    WARNINGS    ).



   Renal Toxicity

  Rise in BUN has been reported and is apparently dose related (see    WARNINGS    ).



   Hypersensitivity Reactions

  Urticaria, angioneurotic edema, anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid purpura, pericarditis and exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus.



 Bulging fontanels in infants and benign intracranial hypertension in adults have been reported in individuals receiving full therapeutic dosages.  These conditions disappeared rapidly when the drug was discontinued.



   Blood

  Hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and eosinophilia have been reported.



 When given over prolonged periods, tetracyclines have been reported to produce brown-black microscopic discoloration of thyroid glands.  No abnormalities of thyroid function studies are known to occur.

  Prescribing doxycycline in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.



 As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi.  If superinfection occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.



 In venereal diseases when coexistent syphilis is suspected, a dark field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least four months.



 Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage.



 In long-term therapy, periodic laboratory evaluation of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal and hepatic studies should be performed.



 All infections due to group A beta-hemolytic streptococci should be treated for at least 10 days.



 Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline in conjunction with penicillin.



    Pregnancy



     Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category D      



 There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of doxycycline in pregnant women.  The vast majority of reported experience with doxycycline during human pregnancy is short-term, first trimester exposure.  There are no human data available to assess the effects of long-term therapy of doxycycline in pregnant women such as that proposed for treatment of anthrax exposure.  An expert review of published data on experiences with doxycycline use during pregnancy by TERIS-the Teratogen Information System-concluded that therapeutic doses during pregnancy are unlikely to pose a substantial teratogenic risk (the quantity and quality of data were assessed as limited to fair), but the data are insufficient to state that there is no risk.  1  



 A case-control study (18,515 mothers of infants with congenital anomalies and 32,804 mothers of infants with no congenital anomalies) shows a weak but marginally statistically significant association with total malformations and use of doxycycline anytime during pregnancy.  (Sixty-three (0.19%) of the controls and 56 (0.3%) of the cases were treated with doxycycline).  This association was not seen when the analysis was confined to maternal treatment during the period of organogenesis (i.e., in the second and third months of gestation) with the exception of a marginal relationship with neural tube defect based on only two exposed cases.  2  



 A small prospective study of 81 pregnancies describes 43 pregnant women treated for 10 days with doxycycline during early first trimester.  All mothers reported their exposed infants were normal at 1 year of age.  3  



    Nursing Mothers



  Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk, however, the extent of absorption of tetracyclines, including doxycycline, by the breastfed infant is not known.  Short-term use by lactating women is not necessarily contraindicated; however, the effects of prolonged exposure to doxycycline in breast milk are unknown.  4    Because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants from doxycycline, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (see   WARNINGS    ).



    Information for Patients



  Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including doxycycline should only be used to treat bacterial infections.  They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold).  When doxycycline is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed.  Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by doxycycline or other antibacterial drugs in the future.



 Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued.  Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic.  If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

  THE USE OF DRUGS OF THE TETRACYCLINE CLASS DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT (LAST HALF OF PREGNANCY, INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD TO THE AGE OF 8 YEARS) MAY CAUSE PERMANENT DISCOLORATION OF THE TEETH (YELLOW-GRAY-BROWN).  This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drugs but has been observed following repeated short-term courses.  Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported.  TETRACYCLINE DRUGS, THEREFORE, SHOULD NOT BE USED IN THIS AGE GROUP, EXCEPT FOR ANTHRAX, INCLUDING INHALATIONAL ANTHRAX (POST-EXPOSURE), UNLESS OTHER DRUGS ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE EFFECTIVE OR ARE CONTRAINDICATED.



   Clostridium difficile    associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including doxycycline for injection, USP, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of  C. difficile.    



   C. difficile    produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD.  Hypertoxin producing strains of  C. difficile    cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy.  CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use.  Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.



 If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against  C. difficile    may need to be discontinued.  Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of  C. difficile,    and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.



 Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines.  Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light, should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema.



 The anti-anabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN.  Studies to date indicate that this does not occur with the use of doxycycline in patients with impaired renal function.



     Usage in Pregnancy      
 

 (See above   WARNINGS    about use during tooth development).



 Doxycycline for injection has not been studied in pregnant patients.  It should not be used in pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, it is essential for the welfare of the patient.



 Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development).  Evidence of embryotoxicity has also been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy.



     Usage in Children      
 

 The use of doxycycline for injection in children under 8 years is not recommended because safe conditions for its use have not been established.  (See above   WARNINGS    about use during tooth development).



 As with other tetracyclines, doxycycline forms a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue.  A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in prematures given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours.  This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued.



 Tetracyclines are present in the milk of lactating women who are taking a drug in this class.
