  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

   Patient Exposure

 The data described in this section are derived from a clinical trial database consisting of a total of 3817 subjects (approximately 1705 patient-years exposure) with schizophrenia who received at least one dose of INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  in the recommended dose range of 39 mg to 234 mg and a total of 510 subjects with schizophrenia who received placebo. Among the 3817 INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  -treated subjects, 1293 received INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  in four fixed-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (one 9-week and three 13-week studies), 849 received INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  in the maintenance trial (median exposure 229 days during the initial 33-week open-label phase of this study, of whom 205 continued to receive INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  during the double-blind placebo-controlled phase of this study [median exposure 171 days]), and 1675 received INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  in five non-placebo controlled trials (three noninferiority active-comparator trials, one long-term open-label pharmacokinetic and safety study, and an injection site [deltoid-gluteal] cross-over trial). One of the 13-week studies included a 234 mg INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  initiation dose followed by treatment with either 39 mg, 156 mg, or 234 mg every 4 weeks.

 The safety of INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  was also evaluated in a 15-month, long-term study comparing INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  to selected oral antipsychotic therapies in adult subjects with schizophrenia. A total of 226 subjects received INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  during the 15-month, open-label period of this study; 218 subjects received selected oral antipsychotic therapies. The safety of INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  was similar to that seen in previous double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in adult subjects with schizophrenia.

 The safety of INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  was also evaluated in a long-term study in adult subjects with schizoaffective disorder. A total of 667 subjects received INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  during the initial 25-week open-label period of this study (median exposure 147 days); 164 subjects continued to receive INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  during the 15-month double-blind placebo-controlled period of this study (median exposure 446 days). Adverse reactions that occurred more frequently in the INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  than the placebo group (a 2% difference or more between groups) were weight increased, nasopharyngitis, headache, hyperprolactinemia, and pyrexia.

   Adverse Reactions in Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials

     Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions:  The most common (at least 5% in any INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  group) and likely drug-related (adverse events for which the drug rate is at least twice the placebo rate) adverse reactions from the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in subjects with schizophrenia were injection site reactions, somnolence/sedation, dizziness, akathisia, and extrapyramidal disorder  .  No occurrences of adverse events reached this threshold in the long-term double-blind, placebo-controlled study in subjects with schizoaffective disorder.

     Discontinuation of Treatment Due to Adverse Events:  The percentage of subjects who discontinued due to adverse events in the four fixed-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled schizophrenia trials were similar for INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  - and placebo-treated subjects.

 The percentage of subjects who discontinued due to adverse events in the open-label period of the long-term study in subjects with schizoaffective disorder was 7.5%. During the double-blind, placebo-controlled period of that study, the percentages of subjects who discontinued due to adverse events were 5.5% and 1.8% in INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  - and placebo-treated subjects, respectively.

     Dose-Related Adverse Reactions:  Based on the pooled data from the four fixed-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in subjects with schizophrenia, among the adverse reactions that occurred with &gt;= 2% incidence in the subjects treated with INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  , only akathisia increased with dose. Hyperprolactinemia also exhibited a dose relationship, but did not occur at &gt;= 2% incidence in INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  -treated subjects from the four fixed-dose studies.

     Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 2% or More in INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  -Treated Patients:  Table 10 lists the adverse reactions reported in 2% or more of INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  -treated subjects and at a greater proportion than in the placebo group with schizophrenia in the four fixed-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials.

   Demographic Differences

 An examination of population subgroups in the double-blind placebo-controlled trials did not reveal any evidence of differences in safety on the basis of age, gender, or race alone; however, there were few subjects 65 years of age and older.

   Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS)

 Pooled data from the two double-blind, placebo-controlled, 13-week, fixed-dose trials in adult subjects with schizophrenia provided information regarding EPS. Several methods were used to measure EPS: (1) the Simpson-Angus global score which broadly evaluates parkinsonism, (2) the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale global clinical rating score which evaluates akathisia, (3) the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale scores which evaluates dyskinesia, and (4) use of anticholinergic medications to treat EPS (Table 11), and (5) incidence of spontaneous reports of EPS (Table 12).

           The results across all phases of the maintenance trial in subjects with schizophrenia exhibited comparable findings. In the 9-week, fixed-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, the proportions of parkinsonism and akathisia assessed by incidence of rating scales were higher in the INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  156 mg group (18% and 11%, respectively) than in the INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  78 mg group (9% and 5%, respectively) and placebo group (7% and 4%, respectively).
 

 In the 13-week study in subjects with schizophrenia involving 234 mg initiation dosing, the incidence of any EPS was similar to that of the placebo group (8%), but exhibited a dose-related pattern with 6%, 10%, and 11% in the INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  234/39 mg, 234/156 mg, and 234/234 mg groups, respectively. Hyperkinesia was the most frequent category of EPS-related adverse events in this study, and was reported at a similar rate between the placebo (4.9%) and INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  234/156 mg (4.8%) and 234/234 mg (5.5%) groups, but at a lower rate in the 234/39 mg group (1.3%).

 In the long-term study in subjects with schizoaffective disorder, EPS reported during the 25-week open-label INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  treatment included hyperkinesia (12.3%), parkinsonism (8.7%), tremor (3.4%), dyskinesia (2.5%), and dystonia (2.1%). During the 15-month double-blind treatment, the incidence of any EPS was similar to that of the placebo group (8.5% and 7.1% respectively). The most commonly reported treatment-emergent EPS-related adverse events (&gt; 2%) in any treatment group in the double-blind phase of the study (INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  versus placebo) were hyperkinesia (3.7% vs. 2.9%), parkinsonism (3.0% vs. 1.8%), and tremor (1.2% vs. 2.4%).

   Dystonia

 Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups.

   Pain Assessment and Local Injection Site Reactions

 In the pooled data from the two 13-week, fixed-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in subjects with schizophrenia, the mean intensity of injection pain reported by subjects using a visual analog scale (0 = no pain to 100 = unbearably painful) decreased in all treatment groups from the first to the last injection (placebo: 10.9 to 9.8; 39 mg: 10.3 to 7.7; 78 mg: 10.0 to 9.2; 156 mg: 11.1 to 8.8). The results from both the 9-week, fixed-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and the double-blind phase of the maintenance trial exhibited comparable findings.

 In the 13-week study involving 234 mg initiation dosing in subjects with schizophrenia, occurrences of induration, redness, or swelling, as assessed by blinded study personnel, were infrequent, generally mild, decreased over time, and similar in incidence between the INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  and placebo groups. Investigator ratings of injection pain were similar for the placebo and INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  groups. Investigator evaluations of the injection site after the first injection for redness, swelling, induration, and pain were rated as absent for 69-100% of subjects in both the INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  and placebo groups. At Day 92, investigators rated absence of redness, swelling, induration, and pain in 95-100% of subjects in both the INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  and placebo groups.

   Additional Adverse Reactions Reported in Clinical Trials with Oral Paliperidone

 The following is a list of additional adverse reactions that have been reported in clinical trials with oral paliperidone:

   Cardiac disorders  : bundle branch block left, sinus arrhythmia

   Gastrointestinal disorders  : abdominal pain, small intestinal obstruction

   General disorders and administration site conditions  : edema, edema peripheral

   Immune system disorders  : anaphylactic reaction

   Infections and infestations:  rhinitis

   Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders  : musculoskeletal pain, torticollis, trismus

   Nervous system disorders  : grand mal convulsion, parkinsonian gait, transient ischemic attack

   Psychiatric disorders:  sleep disorder

   Reproductive system and breast disorders  : breast engorgement

   Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders:  pharyngolaryngeal pain, pneumonia aspiration

   Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:  rash papular

   Vascular disorders  : hypotension, ischemia

   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of paliperidone; because these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: angioedema, ileus, swollen tongue, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, urinary incontinence, and urinary retention.

 Cases of anaphylactic reaction after injection with INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  have been reported during postmarketing experience in patients who have previously tolerated oral risperidone or oral paliperidone.

 Paliperidone is the major active metabolite of risperidone. Adverse reactions reported with oral risperidone and risperidone long-acting injection can be found in the  Adverse Reactions (6)  sections of the package inserts for those products.

   5.1 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis

  Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see  Boxed Warning  and  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]  .

    5.2 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions, Including Stroke, in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis

  In placebo-controlled trials with risperidone, aripiprazole, and olanzapine in elderly subjects with dementia, there was a higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (cerebrovascular accidents and transient ischemic attacks) including fatalities compared to placebo-treated subjects. No studies have been conducted with oral paliperidone, INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  , or the 3-month paliperidone palmitate extended-release injectable suspension in elderly patients with dementia. These medicines are not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see  Boxed Warning  and  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  .

    5.3 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome

  A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs, including paliperidone.

 Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.

 The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases in which the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever, and primary central nervous system pathology.

 The management of NMS should include: (1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy; (2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring; and (3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS.

 If a patient appears to require antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, reintroduction of drug therapy should be closely monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported.

    5.4 QT Prolongation

  Paliperidone causes a modest increase in the corrected QT (QTc) interval. The use of paliperidone should be avoided in combination with other drugs that are known to prolong QTc including Class 1A (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications, antipsychotic medications (e.g., chlorpromazine, thioridazine), antibiotics (e.g., gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin), or any other class of medications known to prolong the QTc interval. Paliperidone should also be avoided in patients with congenital long QT syndrome and in patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias.

 Certain circumstances may increase the risk of the occurrence of Torsades de pointes and/or sudden death in association with the use of drugs that prolong the QTc interval, including (1) bradycardia; (2) hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia; (3) concomitant use of other drugs that prolong the QTc interval; and (4) presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval.

 The effects of oral paliperidone on the QT interval were evaluated in a double-blind, active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg single dose), multicenter QT study in adults with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, and in three placebo- and active-controlled 6-week, fixed-dose efficacy trials in adults with schizophrenia.

 In the QT study (n=141), the 8 mg dose of immediate-release oral paliperidone (n=50) showed a mean placebo-subtracted increase from baseline in QTcLD of 12.3 msec (90% CI: 8.9; 15.6) on day 8 at 1.5 hours post-dose. The mean steady-state peak plasma concentration for this 8 mg dose of paliperidone immediate release (Cmax ss= 113 ng/mL) was more than 2-fold the exposure observed with the maximum recommended 234 mg dose of INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  administered in the deltoid muscle (predicted median Cmax ss= 50 ng/mL). In this same study, a 4 mg dose of the immediate-release oral formulation of paliperidone, for which Cmax ss= 35 ng/mL, showed an increased placebo-subtracted QTcLD of 6.8 msec (90% CI: 3.6; 10.1) on day 2 at 1.5 hours post-dose.

 In the three fixed-dose efficacy studies of oral paliperidone extended release in subjects with schizophrenia, electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements taken at various time points showed only one subject in the oral paliperidone 12 mg group had a change exceeding 60 msec at one time-point on Day 6 (increase of 62 msec).

 In the four fixed-dose efficacy studies of INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  in subjects with schizophrenia and in the long-term study in subjects with schizoaffective disorder, no subject experienced a change in QTcLD exceeding 60 msec and no subject had a QTcLD value of &gt; 500 msec at any time point. In the maintenance study in subjects with schizophrenia, no subject had a QTcLD change &gt; 60 msec, and one subject had a QTcLD value of 507 msec (Bazett's QT corrected interval [QTcB] value of 483 msec); this latter subject also had a heart rate of 45 beats per minute.

    5.5 Tardive Dyskinesia

  A syndrome of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to predict which patients will develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown.

 The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible appear to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase, but the syndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses, although this is uncommon.

  The syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment itself may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and may thus mask the underlying process. The effect of symptomatic suppression on the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.  

 Given these considerations, INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.

 If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient treated with INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  , drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  despite the presence of the syndrome.

    5.6 Metabolic Changes

  Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While all of the drugs in the class have been shown to produce some metabolic changes, each drug has its own specific risk profile.

   Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus

 Hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, have been reported in patients treated with all atypical antipsychotics. These cases were, for the most part, seen in post-marketing clinical use and epidemiologic studies, not in clinical trials. Hyperglycemia and diabetes have been reported in trial subjects treated with INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  . Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse events is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics.

 Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug.

 Pooled data from the four placebo-controlled (one 9-week and three 13-week), fixed-dose studies in subjects with schizophrenia are presented in Table 5.

              In a long-term open-label pharmacokinetic and safety study in subjects with schizophrenia in which the highest dose available (234 mg) was evaluated, INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  was associated with a mean change in glucose of -0.4 mg/dL at Week 29 (n=109) and +6.8 mg/dL at Week 53 (n=100).
 

 During the initial 25-week open-label period of a long-term study in subjects with schizoaffective disorder, INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  was associated with mean change in glucose of +5.3 mg/dL (n=518). At the endpoint of the subsequent 15-month double-blind period of the study, INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  was associated with a mean change in glucose of +0.3 mg/dL (n=131) compared with a mean change of +4.0 mg/dL in the placebo group (n=120).

   Dyslipidemia

 Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics.

 Pooled data from the four placebo-controlled (one 9-week and three 13-week), fixed-dose studies in subjects with schizophrenia are presented in Table 6.

            Weight Gain
 

 Weight gain has been observed with atypical antipsychotic use. Clinical monitoring of weight is recommended.

 Data on mean changes in body weight and the proportion of subjects meeting a weight gain criterion of &gt;= 7% of body weight from the four placebo-controlled (one 9-week and three 13-week), fixed-dose studies in subjects with schizophrenia are presented in Table 9.

Other dose groups (39 mg, 78 mg, and 156 mg) are from studies involving only gluteal injection. [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].]    234/156 mg     234/234 mg

              In a long-term open-label pharmacokinetic and safety study in which the highest dose available (234 mg) was evaluated, INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  was associated with a mean change in weight of +2.4 kg at Week 29 (n=134) and +4.3 kg at Week 53 (n=113).
 

 During the initial 25-week open-label period of a long-term study in subjects with schizoaffective disorder, INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  was associated with a mean change in weight of +2.2 kg and 18.4% of subjects had an increase in body weight of &gt;= 7% (n=653). At the endpoint of the subsequent 15-month double-blind period of the study, INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  was associated with a mean change in weight of -0.2 kg and 13.0% of subjects had an increase in body weight of &gt;= 7% (n=161); the placebo group had a mean change in weight of -0.8 kg and 6.0% of subjects had an increase in body weight of &gt;= 7% (n=168).

    5.7 Orthostatic Hypotension and Syncope

  Paliperidone can induce orthostatic hypotension and syncope in some patients because of its alpha-adrenergic blocking activity. Syncope was reported in &lt; 1% (4/1293) of subjects treated with INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  in the recommended dose range of 39 mg to 234 mg in the four fixed-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials compared with 0% (0/510) of subjects treated with placebo. In the four fixed-dose efficacy studies in subjects with schizophrenia, orthostatic hypotension was reported as an adverse event by &lt; 1% (2/1293) of INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  -treated subjects compared to 0% (0/510) with placebo. Incidences of orthostatic hypotension and syncope in the long-term studies in subjects with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder were similar to those observed in the short-term studies.

 INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (e.g., heart failure, history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, or conditions that predispose the patient to hypotension (e.g., dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications). Monitoring of orthostatic vital signs should be considered in patients who are vulnerable to hypotension.

    5.8 Falls

   Somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability have been reported with the use of antipsychotics, including INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  , which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other fall-related injuries. For patients, particularly the elderly, with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, assess the risk of falls when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy.  

    5.9 Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis

  In clinical trial and/or postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia and neutropenia have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents, including INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  . Agranulocytosis has also been reported.

 Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC)/absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia. In patients with a history of a clinically significant low WBC/ANC or a drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia, perform a complete blood count (CBC) frequently during the first few months of therapy. In such patients, consider discontinuation of INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors.

 Monitor patients with clinically significant neutropenia for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treat promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Discontinue INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  in patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1000/mm  3  ) and follow their WBC until recovery.

    5.10 Hyperprolactinemia

  Like other drugs that antagonize dopamine D2receptors, paliperidone elevates prolactin levels and the elevation persists during chronic administration. Paliperidone has a prolactin-elevating effect similar to that seen with risperidone, a drug that is associated with higher levels of prolactin than other antipsychotic drugs.

 Hyperprolactinemia, regardless of etiology, may suppress hypothalamic GnRH, resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotrophin secretion. This, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported in patients receiving prolactin-elevating compounds. Long-standing hyperprolactinemia when associated with hypogonadism may lead to decreased bone density in both female and male subjects.

 Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent in vitro  , a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is considered in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. An increase in the incidence of pituitary gland, mammary gland, and pancreatic islet cell neoplasia (mammary adenocarcinomas, pituitary and pancreatic adenomas) was observed in the risperidone carcinogenicity studies conducted in mice and rats [see  Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)  ]  . Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration of this class of drugs and tumorigenesis in humans, but the available evidence is too limited to be conclusive.

  Prolactin data from two long-term, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies with INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  are presented below; one study was in a population of patients with schizophrenia; the second study was in patients with schizoaffective disorder.  

    Schizophrenia  

  In a long-term maintenance trial of INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  in schizophrenia patients (Study PSY-3001), see   Clinical Studies (14.1)    , elevations of prolactin to above the reference range (&gt; 18 ng/mL in males and &gt; 30 ng/mL in females) relative to open-label baseline at any time during the double-blind phase were noted in a higher percentage of the patients in the INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  group than those in the placebo group in males (51.9% vs. 29.0%) and in females (50.5% vs. 42.9%). During the double-blind phase, 4 females (4.2%) in the INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  group experienced potentially prolactin-related adverse reactions (amenorrhea N=2; galactorrhea N=1; menstruation irregular N=1), while 2 females (2.2%) in the placebo group experienced potentially prolactin-related adverse reactions (amenorrhea N=1; breast pain N=1). One male (0.9%) in the INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  group experienced erectile dysfunction and 1 male (0.9%) in placebo group experienced gynecomastia.  

  Prior to the double-blind phase (during the 33-week open-label phase of the long-term maintenance trial), the mean (SD) serum prolactin values at baseline were 14.9 (22.3) ng/mL in males (N=490) and 35.2 (39.6) ng/mL in females (N=358). At the end of the open-label phase, mean (SD) prolactin values were 24.7 (22.5) ng/mL in males (N=470) and 59.5 (38.1) ng/mL in females (N=333). During the open-label phases 49.2% of females and 47.7% of males experienced elevations of prolactin above the reference range relative to baseline, and a higher proportion of females experienced potentially prolactin-related adverse reactions compared to males (5.3% vs. 1.8%). Amenorrhea (2.5%) in females and no single potentially prolactin-related adverse reaction in males were observed with a rate greater than 2%.  

    Schizoaffective Disorder  

  In a long-term maintenance trial of INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  in patients with schizoaffective disorder (Study SCA-3004) see   Clinical Studies (14.2)    , elevations of prolactin to above the reference range (&gt; 13.13 ng/mL in males and &gt; 26.72 ng/mL in females) relative to open-label baseline at any time during the 15-month double-blind phase were noted in a higher percentage of patients in the INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  group than those in the placebo group in males (55.6% vs. 23.2%) and in females (44.3% vs. 25.0%). During the 15-month double-blind phase, 11 females (13.9%) in the INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  group had 14 potentially prolactin-related adverse reactions (hyperprolactinemia N=3; blood prolactin increased N=4; libido decreased N=1; amenorrhea N=3; galactorrhea N=3), while 5 females (5.8%) in the placebo group had 6 potentially prolactin-related adverse reactions (hyperprolactinemia N=2; blood prolactin increased N=1; amenorrhea N=2; galactorrhea N=1). Six males (7.1%) in the INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  group experienced 6 potentially prolactin-related adverse reactions (hyperprolactinemia N=4; libido decreased N=1; erectile dysfunction N=1), while 1 male (1.2%) in the placebo group experienced adverse reaction of blood prolactin increased.  

  Prior to the 15-month double-blind phase (during the 25-week open-label phase of the long-term maintenance trial), the mean (SD) serum prolactin values at baseline were 14.6 (14.0) ng/mL in males (N=352) and 39.1 (44.6) ng/mL in females (N=302). At the end of the open-label phase, mean (SD) prolactin values were 32.8 (17.2) ng/mL in males (N=275) and 72.4 (46.5) ng/mL in females (N=239). During the open-label phase, 48.9% of females and 53.3% of males experienced elevations of prolactin above the reference range relative to baseline, and a higher proportion of females experienced potentially prolactin-related adverse reactions compared to males (10.0% vs. 9.0%). Amenorrhea (5.8%) and galactorrhea (2.9%) in females and libido decrease (2.8%) and erectile dysfunction (2.5%) in males were observed with a rate greater than 2%.  

    5.11 Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment

  Somnolence, sedation, and dizziness were reported as adverse reactions in subjects treated with INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)   [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Antipsychotics, including INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  , have the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills. Patients should be cautioned about performing activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating hazardous machinery or operating a motor vehicle, until they are reasonably certain that paliperidone therapy does not adversely affect them.

    5.12 Seizures

  In the four fixed-dose double-blind placebo-controlled studies in subjects with schizophrenia, &lt;1% (1/1293) of subjects treated with INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  in the recommended dose range of 39 mg to 234 mg experienced an adverse event of convulsion compared with &lt;1% (1/510) of placebo-treated subjects who experienced an adverse event of grand mal convulsion.

 Like other antipsychotic drugs, INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or other conditions that potentially lower the seizure threshold. Conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in patients 65 years or older.

    5.13 Dysphagia

  Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia.

    5.14 Priapism

  Drugs with alpha-adrenergic blocking effects have been reported to induce priapism. Although no cases of priapism have been reported in clinical trials with INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  , priapism has been reported with oral paliperidone during postmarketing surveillance. Severe priapism may require surgical intervention.

    5.15 Disruption of Body Temperature Regulation

  Disruption of the body's ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Appropriate care is advised when prescribing INVEGA SUSTENNA  (r)  to patients who will be experiencing conditions which may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature, e.g., exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medication with anticholinergic activity, or being subject to dehydration.
