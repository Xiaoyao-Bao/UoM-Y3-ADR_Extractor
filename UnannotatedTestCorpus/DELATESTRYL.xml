    Endocrine and Urogenital, Female  - The most common side effects of androgen therapy are amenorrhea and other menstrual irregularities, inhibition of gonadotropin secretion, and virilization, including deepening of the voice and clitoral enlargement. The latter usually is not reversible after androgens are discontinued. When administered to a pregnant woman, androgens cause virilization of the external genitalia of the female fetus.



   Male  - Gynecomastia, and excessive frequency and duration of penile erections. Oligospermia may occur at high dosages (see    CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY    ).



   Cardiovascular Disorders  - myocardial infarction, stroke



   Skin and Appendages  - Hirsutism, male pattern baldness, and acne.



   Fluid and Electrolyte Disturbances  - Retention of sodium, chloride, water, potassium, calcium (see    WARNINGS    ), and inorganic phosphates.



   Gastrointestinal  - Nausea, cholestatic jaundice, alterations in liver function tests; rarely, hepatocellular neoplasms, peliosis hepatis (see    WARNINGS    ).



   Hematologic  - Suppression of clotting factors II, V, VII, and X; bleeding in patients on concomitant anticoagulant therapy; polycythemia.



   Nervous System  - Increased or decreased libido, headache, anxiety, depression, and generalized paresthesia.



   Metabolic  - Increased serum cholesterol.



   Vascular Disorders  - venous thromboembolism



   Miscellaneous  - Rarely, anaphylactoid reactions; inflammation and pain at injection site.

    General  



  Women should be observed for signs of virilization (deepening of the voice, hirsutism, acne, clitoromegaly, and menstrual irregularities). Discontinuation of drug therapy at the time of evidence of mild virilism is necessary to prevent irreversible virilization. Such virilization is usual following androgen use at high doses and is not prevented by concomitant use of estrogens. A decision may be made by the patient and the physician that some virilization will be tolerated during treatment for breast carcinoma.



 Because androgens may alter serum cholesterol concentration, caution should be used when administering these drugs to patients with a history of myocardial infarction or coronary artery disease. Serial determinations of serum cholesterol should be made and therapy adjusted accordingly. A causal relationship between myocardial infarction and hypercholesterolemia has not been established.



     Information for Patients  



  Male adolescent patients receiving androgens for delayed puberty should have bone development checked every six months.



 The physician should instruct patients to report any of the following side effects of androgens:



   Adult or adolescent males  - too frequent or persistent erections of the penis.   Women  - hoarseness, acne, changes in menstrual periods, or more facial hair. All patients  - any nausea, vomiting, changes in skin color, or ankle swelling.
 

     Geriatric Use  



  Clinical studies of DELATESTRYL did not include sufficient numbers of subjects, aged 65 and older, to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Testosterone replacement is not indicated in geriatric patients who have age-related hypogonadism only ("andropause"), because there is insufficient safety and efficacy information to support such use. Current studies do not assess whether testosterone use increases risks of prostate cancer, prostate hyperplasia, and cardiovascular disease in the geriatric population.



     Intramuscular Administration  



  When properly given, injections of DELATESTRYL are well tolerated. Care should be taken to slowly inject the preparation deeply into the gluteal muscle, being sure to follow the usual precautions for intramuscular administration, such as the avoidance of intravascular injection. There have been rare postmarketing reports of transient reactions involving urge to cough, coughing fits, and respiratory distress immediately after the injection of DELATESTRYL, an oil-based depot preparation (see   DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION    ).



     Laboratory Tests  



  Women with disseminated breast carcinoma should have frequent determination of urine and serum calcium levels during the course of androgen therapy (see   WARNINGS    ).



 Periodic (every six months) X-ray examinations of bone age should be made during treatment of pre-pubertal males to determine the rate of bone maturation and the effects of androgen therapy on the epiphyseal centers.



 Hemoglobin and hematocrit should be checked periodically for polycythemia in patients who are receiving high doses of androgens.



     Drug Interactions  



  When administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with androgens:



  Anticoagulants, oral  - C-17 substituted derivatives of testosterone, such as methandrostenolone, have been reported to decrease the anticoagulant requirement. Patients receiving oral anticoagulant therapy require close monitoring especially when androgens are started or stopped.



  Antidiabetic drugs and insulin  - In diabetic patients, the metabolic effects of androgens may decrease blood glucose and insulin requirements.



  ACTH and corticosteroids  - Enhanced tendency toward edema. Use caution when giving these drugs together, especially in patients with hepatic or cardiac disease.



  Oxyphenbutazone  - Elevated serum levels of oxyphenbutazone may result.



     Drug/Laboratory Test Interferences  



  Androgens may decrease levels of thyroxine-binding globulin, resulting in decreased total T4serum levels and increased resin uptake of T3and T4. Free thyroid hormone levels remain unchanged, however, and there is no clinical evidence of thyroid dysfunction.



     Carcinogenesis  



  Testosterone has been tested by subcutaneous injection and implantation in mice and rats. The implant induced cervical-uterine tumors in mice, which metastasized in some cases. There is suggestive evidence that injection of testosterone into some strains of female mice increases their susceptibility to hepatoma. Testosterone is also known to increase the number of tumors and decrease the degree of differentiation of chemically induced carcinomas of the liver in rats.



 There are rare reports of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients receiving long-term therapy with androgens in high doses. Withdrawal of the drugs did not lead to regression of the tumors in all cases.



 Geriatric patients treated with androgens may be at an increased risk for the development of prostatic hypertrophy and prostatic carcinoma.



     Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects  



  Category X (see   CONTRAINDICATIONS    ).



     Nursing Mothers  



  It is not known whether androgens are excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from androgens, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.



     Pediatric Use  



  Androgen therapy should be used very cautiously in pediatric patients and only by specialists who are aware of the adverse effects on bone maturation. Skeletal maturation must be monitored every six months by an X-ray of the hand and wrist (see   INDICATIONS AND USAGE    , and   WARNINGS    ).

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings">     WARNINGS  



  In patients with breast cancer and in immobilized patients, androgen therapy may cause hypercalcemia by stimulating osteolysis. In patients with cancer, hypercalcemia may indicate progression of bony metastasis. If hypercalcemia occurs, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate measures instituted.



 Prolonged use of high doses of androgens has been associated with the development of peliosis hepatis and hepatic neoplasms including hepatocellular carcinoma (see   PRECAUTIONS, Carcinogenesis    ). Peliosis hepatis can be a life-threatening or fatal complication.



 If cholestatic hepatitis with jaundice appears or if liver function tests become abnormal, the androgen should be discontinued and the etiology should be determined. Drug-induced jaundice is reversible when the medication is discontinued.



 Geriatric patients treated with androgens may be at an increased risk for the development of prostatic hypertrophy and prostatic carcinoma.



 There have been postmarketing reports of venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients using testosterone products, such as DELATESTRYL  (r)  .  Evaluate patients who report symptoms of pain, edema, warmth and erythema in the lower extremity for DVT and those who present with acute shortness of breath for PE.  If a venous thromboembolic event is suspected, discontinue treatment with DELATESTRYL  (r)  and initiate appropriate workup and management .  



 Long term clinical safety trials have not been conducted to assess the cardiovascular outcomes of testosterone replacement therapy in men. To date, epidemiologic studies and randomized controlled trials have been inconclusive for determining the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), such as non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and cardiovascular death, with the use of testosterone compared to non-use. Some studies, but not all, have reported an increased risk of MACE in association with use of testosterone replacement therapy in men. Patients should be informed of this possible risk when deciding whether to use or to continue to use DELATESTRYL.



 Testosterone has been subject to abuse, typically at doses higher than recommended for the approved indication and in combination with other anabolic steroids. This type of testosterone abuse can lead to serious cardiovascular and psychiatric adverse reactions (  see     DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE    ).



 If testosterone abuse is suspected, check serum testosterone concentrations to ensure they are within therapeutic range. However, testosterone levels may be in the normal or subnormal range in men abusing synthetic testosterone derivatives. Counsel patients concerning the serious adverse reactions associated with abuse of testosterone and anabolic steroids. Conversely, consider the possibility of testosterone and anabolic steroid abuse in suspected patients who present with serious cardiovascular or psychiatric adverse events.



 Due to sodium and water retention, edema with or without congestive heart failure may be a serious complication in patients with preexisting cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease. In addition to discontinuation of the drug, diuretic therapy may be required. If the administration of testosterone enanthate is restarted, a lower dose should be used.



 Gynecomastia frequently develops and occasionally persists in patients being treated for hypogonadism.



 Androgen therapy should be used cautiously in healthy males with delayed puberty. The effect on bone maturation should be monitored by assessing bone age of the wrist and hand every six months. In children, androgen treatment may accelerate bone maturation without producing compensatory gain in linear growth. This adverse effect may result in compromised adult stature. The younger the child the greater the risk of compromising final mature height.
