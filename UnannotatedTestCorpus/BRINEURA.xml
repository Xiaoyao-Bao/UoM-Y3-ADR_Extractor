  6.1     Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The safety of Brineura was evaluated in 24 patients with CLN2 disease who received at least one dose of Brineura in a clinical study with extension of up to 161 weeks  [see Clinical Studies (  14  )]  . Table 1 summarizes the most common adverse reactions that occurred in Brineura-treated patients through 96 weeks.

   Description of Selected Adverse Reactions  



   Seizures  



 Seizures were reported in 12 of 24 (50%) patients. The seizure types reported include atonic, generalized tonic-clonic, focal, and absence. Seizures were managed with standard anti-convulsive therapies and did not result in discontinuation of Brineura treatment.



   Device-Related Complications  



 Adverse reactions related to the device were observed in 12 of 24 (50%) of patients. Device-related adverse reactions include infection, delivery system-related complications, and pleocytosis. Nine of these patients (38%) experienced adverse reactions, which involved complications of the non-implanted delivery system components. Four patients (16%) had device-related adverse reactions, which required medical intervention, including two patients (8%) with intraventricular access device-related CNS infections, and one patient (4%) each with leakage of the intraventricular access device and pleocytosis. Device-related infections were diagnosed by increased CSF pleocytosis and microbiology culture and organism identification, without accompanying signs and symptoms of meningitis. Intraventricular access devices were replaced and infections were treated with antibiotics  .  Device-related complications did not result in discontinuation of Brineura treatment  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )]  .



   Hematoma  



 Hematoma adverse reactions were reported in 5 (21%) patients treated with Brineura and presented as hematoma, post procedural hematoma, traumatic hematoma and subdural hematoma. Hematomas did not require treatment and did not interfere with Brineura infusion.



   Hypersensitivity  



 Hypersensitivity reactions were reported in 11 out of 24 patients (46%) treated with Brineura during or within 24 hours after completion of the Brineura infusion, despite pre-medication with antihistamines with or without antipyretics or corticosteroids  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )]  . The most common manifestations observed concomitantly with hypersensitivity included pyrexia with vomiting, pleocytosis, or irritability, which are not consistent with classic immune mediated hypersensitivity. Symptoms resolved over time or with administration of antipyretics, antihistamines and/or corticosteroids and no patient discontinued treatment with Brineura.



 One patient experienced hypoxia (decreased oxygen saturation less than 88% by pulse oximeter), 8 hours after Brineura infusion, followed by a low mean arterial pressure at 15 hours post infusion. Symptoms resolved after oxygen administration, airway repositioning and normal saline infusion. One patient reported decreased oxygen saturation (90% by pulse oximeter), 45 minutes after starting Brineura with associated low diastolic blood pressures. Hypoxia resolved after oxygen administration. No treatment was administered for the low diastolic blood pressure, which returned to normal while the patient continued to receive Brineura infusion without change to the infusion rate or dose.



   6.2     Immunogenicity

  As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to cerliponase alfa in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading.



 Anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) to cerliponase alfa were detected in both serum and CSF in 79% and 33%, respectively, of patients treated with Brineura for up to 161 weeks. Patients who experienced hypersensitivity adverse reactions were tested for drug-specific IgE and found to be negative, including three patients for whom grade 3 (severe) hypersensitivity adverse reactions were reported. No association was found between serum or CSF ADA titers and incidence or severity of hypersensitivity. Drug-specific neutralizing antibodies (NAb) have not been evaluated.



   6.3     Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Brineura.  Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5     WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *   Intraventricular Access Device-Related Complications: Inspect the scalp for skin integrity and for signs of intraventricular access device leakage. Do not administer if there are signs of device leakage or infection. Routinely send CSF samples for testing to detect subclinical device-related infections. (  2.5  ,  5.1  )
 
    

 item{ Cardiovascular Adverse Reactions: Monitor vital signs before, during, and post-infusion. Monitor Electrocardiogram (ECG) in patients with a history of bradycardia, conduction disorder, or with structural heart disease, during the infusion. In patients without cardiac abnormalities, perform regular 12-lead ECG evaluations every 6 months. (  2.5  ,  5.2  )
 

 item{ Hypersensitivity Reactions: Observe patients during and after the infusion.  If a severe hypersensitivity reaction occurs, immediately stop the infusion and initiate appropriate treatment. (  5.3  )

   5.1       Intraventricular Access Device-Related Complications



  Brineura must be administered using aseptic technique to reduce the risk of infection. Healthcare professionals should inspect the scalp for skin integrity to ensure the intraventricular access device is not compromised prior to each infusion [see Dosage and Administration (  2.5  )]  .



  Brineura is contraindicated if there are signs of acute intraventricular access device-related complications (e.g., leakage, device failure or signs of device-related infection such as swelling, erythema of the scalp, extravasation of fluid, or bulging of the scalp around or above the intraventricular access device) [see Contraindications (  4  )]  . Consultation with a neurosurgeon may be needed to confirm the integrity of the device. In case of intraventricular access device complications, discontinue the Brineura infusion and refer to the device manufacturer's labeling for further instructions.  



 The signs and symptoms of device-related infections may not be apparent, therefore, CSF samples should routinely be sent for testing to detect subclinical device infections [see Dosage and Administration (  2.5  )]  .



  Intraventricular access device-related infections, including sub-clinical infections and meningitis, have been observed in patients treated with Brineura. Meningitis may present with the following symptoms: fever, headache, neck stiffness, light sensitivity, nausea, vomiting, and change in mental status. In clinical studies, antibiotics were administered, the intraventricular access device was replaced, and the patient continued on Brineura treatment.  



  Material degradation of the intraventricular access device reservoir has occurred after approximately 105 perforations of the intraventricular access device in benchtop testing, and observed in clinical trials with approximately 4 years of administration. Intraventricular access device replacement should be considered prior to 4 years of regular administration, equating to 105 administrations of Brineura  .



    5.2       Cardiovascular Adverse Reactions



  Monitor vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate) before infusion starts, periodically during infusion, and post-infusion in a healthcare setting [see Dosage and Administration (  2.5  )]  . Upon completion of the infusion, clinically assess the patient status. Continued observation may be necessary if clinically indicated.



 Perform electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring during infusion in patients with a history of bradycardia, conduction disorder, or with structural heart disease, as some patients with CLN2 disease may develop conduction disorders or heart disease. In patients without cardiac abnormalities, regular 12-lead ECG evaluations should be performed every 6 months.



 In the clinical studies, hypotension was reported in 2 (8%) patients, which occurred during or up to eight hours after Brineura infusion. Patients did not require alteration in treatment, and reactions resolved spontaneously or after intravenous fluid administration [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  .



    5.3       Hypersensitivity Reactions



  Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in Brineura-treated patients during the clinical studies. A total of 11 (46%) patients experienced hypersensitivity reactions during the infusion or within 24 hours of completion of the infusion. The signs and symptoms observed concomitantly with hypersensitivity reactions included pyrexia, vomiting, pleocytosis or irritability. Patients were routinely pre-medicated with antihistamines with or without antipyretics or corticosteroids, prior to infusion of Brineura.



 Due to the potential for anaphylaxis, appropriate medical support should be readily available when Brineura is administered. If anaphylaxis occurs, immediately discontinue the infusion and initiate appropriate medical treatment. Observe patients closely during and after the infusion. Inform patients/caregivers of the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis, and instruct them to seek immediate medical care should signs and symptoms occur.



 The management of hypersensitivity reactions should be based on the severity of the reaction and may include temporarily interrupting the infusion, and/or treatment with antihistamines, antipyretics, and/or corticosteroids. If a severe hypersensitivity reaction occurs, immediately discontinue the infusion and initiate appropriate medical treatment.
