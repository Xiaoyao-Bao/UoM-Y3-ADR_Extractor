    6.1         Clinical Trial    s    Experience  

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 Over 1700 patients with IBS-D have been treated with 75 or 100 mg of VIBERZI twice daily in controlled trials. Exposures from placebo-controlled clinical trials in adult patients with IBS-D included 1391 exposed for 3 months, 1001 exposed for 6 months and 488 exposed for one year. 



 Demographic characteristics were comparable between the treatment groups  [see Clinical Studies (    14    )]    .   Data described below represent pooled data compared to placebo across the randomized trials.



   Pancreatitis  



 Cases of pancreatitis, not associated with sphincter of Oddi spasm, were reported in 2/807 (0.2%) of patients receiving 75 mg and 3/1032 (0.3%) of patients receiving 100 mg VIBERZI twice daily in clinical trials. Of these 5 cases, 3 were associated with excessive alcohol intake, one was associated with biliary sludge, and in one case the patient discontinued VIBERZI 2 weeks prior to the onset of symptoms. All pancreatic events resolved with lipase normalization upon discontinuation of VIBERZI, with 80% (4/5) resolving within 1 week of treatment discontinuation. The case of sphincter of Oddi spasm-induced pancreatitis resolved within 24 hours of discontinuation.



   Sp    h    incter of Oddi Spasm  



 In clinical trials, sphincter of Oddi spasm     occurred in 0.2% (2/807) of patients receiving 75 mg and 0.8% (8/1032) of patients receiving 100 mg VIBERZI twice daily.



 *  Among patients receiving 75 mg, 1/807 (0.1%) patient experienced a sphincter of Oddi spasm presenting with abdominal pain but with lipase elevation less than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and 1/ 807 (0.1%) patient experienced a sphincter of Oddi spasm manifested as elevated hepatic enzymes associated with abdominal pain 
 *  Among patients receiving 100 mg, 1/1032 (0.1%) patient experienced a sphincter of Oddi spasm manifested as pancreatitis and 7/1032 (0.7%) patients experienced sphincter of Oddi spasm manifested as elevated hepatic enzymes associated with abdominal pain 
    Of those patients who experienced a sphincter of Oddi spasm, 80% (8/10) reported their first onset of symptoms within the first week of treatment. The case of sphincter of Oddi spasm-induced pancreatitis occurred within minutes of taking the first dose of VIBERZI. No cases of sphincter of Oddi spasm occurred greater than 1 month after treatment onset. All events resolved upon discontinuation of VIBERZI, with symptoms typically improved by the following day.
 

   Common Adverse Reactions  



   Table 1   provides the incidence of common adverse reactions reported in &gt; 2% of IBS-D patients in either VIBERZI treatment group and at an incidence greater than in the placebo group.

 **  "  Abdominal Pain" term includes: abdominal pain, abdominal pain lower, and abdominal pain upper



 ***  "  Rash" term includes: dermatitis, dermatitis allergic, rash, rash erythematous, rash generalized, rash maculo-papular, rash papular, rash pruritic, urticaria, and idiopathic urticaria



 Constipation was the most commonly reported adverse reaction in VIBERZI-treated patients in these trials. Approximately 50% of constipation events occurred within the first 2 weeks of treatment while the majority occurred within the first 3 months of therapy. Rates of severe constipation were less than 1% in patients receiving 75 mg and 100 mg VIBERZI. Similar rates of constipation occurred between the active and placebo arms beyond 3 months of treatment.



   Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation  



 Eight percent of patients treated with 75 mg, 8% of patients treated with 100 mg VIBERZI and 4% of patients treated with placebo discontinued prematurely due to adverse reactions. In the VIBERZI treatment groups, the most common reasons for discontinuation due to adverse reactions were constipation (1% for 75 mg and 2% for 100 mg) and abdominal pain (1% for both 75 mg and 100 mg). In comparison, less than 1% of patients in the placebo group withdrew due to constipation or abdominal pain.



   Less Common    Adverse Reactions  



 Adverse reactions that were reported in &lt;= 2% of VIBERZI-treated patients are listed below by body system.



   Gastrointestinal  :     gastroesophageal reflux disease  General Disorders and administration site conditions  : feeling drunk  Investigations:  increased AST  Nervous system    :  sedation,     somnolence  Psychiatric disorders  :     euphoric mood  Respiratory  :     asthma, bronchospasm, respiratory failure, wheezing



     6.2         Postmarketing Experience  

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of VIBERZI. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Hypersensitivity  : anaphylaxis, angioedema (e.g. swollen face and throat), dyspnea, throat tightness, and chest pain/tightness  [see Warnings and Precautions (    5.3    )]  .

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">     5        WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  



   EXCERPT:    *   Pancreatitis and  Sphincter of Oddi Spasm : Monitor patients for new or worsening abdominal pain, with or without nausea and vomiting, or acute biliary pain with liver or pancreatic enzyme elevations; immediately discontinue VIBERZI and seek medical attention if symptoms develop. (  5.1  ,  5.2  )    
 *   Hypersensitivity Reactions, including anaphylaxis : Immediately discontinue VIBERZI and seek medical attention if symptoms develop. (  4  ,  5.3  ) 
 *   Constipation: Instruct patients to stop VIBERZI and immediately contact their healthcare provider if they develop severe constipation. Avoid use with other drugs that may cause constipation (  5.4  ,  7  ) 
    
 

    5.1        Pancreatitis  



  Pancreatitis, with or without sphincter of Oddi spasm [ see Warnings and Precautions (    5.1   )  ], has been reported in patients taking either the 75 mg or 100 mg dosage of VIBERZI, including serious cases resulting in hospitalization, primarily in patients without a gallbladder. Fatal cases have also been reported in patients without a gallbladder. VIBERZI is contraindicated in patients without a gallbladder [ see Contraindications (    4   )  ].  Most of the reported cases of serious pancreatitis occurred within a week of starting treatment with VIBERZI and some developed symptoms after one to two doses.   



 In patients with a gallbladder, evaluate a patient's alcohol intake prior to starting VIBERZI. Instruct patients to avoid chronic or acute excessive alcohol use while taking VIBERZI. Monitor for new or worsening abdominal pain that may radiate to the back or shoulder, with or without nausea and vomiting. Instruct patients to immediately stop VIBERZI and seek medical attention if they experience symptoms suggestive of pancreatitis such as acute abdominal or epigastric pain radiating to the back or shoulder associated with elevations of pancreatic enzymes with or without nausea and vomiting [ see Contraindications (    4   )  ].



     5.2        Sphincter of Oddi Spasm  



  There is a risk of sphincter of Oddi spasm, resulting in pancreatitis or hepatic enzyme elevation associated with acute abdominal pain (e.g., biliary-type pain) in patients taking VIBERZI [ see Adverse Reactions (    6.1   )  ]. Postmarketing serious adverse reactions of sphincter of Oddi spasm with or without pancreatitis resulting in hospitalization have been reported, primarily in patients without a gallbladder [ see Warnings and Precautions (    5.1   )  ]. Most of the reported cases of serious sphincter of Oddi spasm occurred within a week of starting treatment with VIBERZI and some developed symptoms after one to two doses. VIBERZI is contraindicated in patients without a gallbladder [ see Contraindications (    4   )  ].



 Instruct patients to immediately stop VIBERZI and seek medical attention if they experience symptoms suggestive of sphincter of Oddi spasm such as acute worsening of abdominal pain, (e.g. acute epigastric or biliary [i.e., right upper quadrant] pain), that may radiate to the back or shoulder with or without nausea and vomiting, associated with elevations of pancreatic enzymes or liver transaminases. Do not restart VIBERZI in patients who developed biliary duct obstruction or sphincter of Oddi spasm while taking VIBERZI [ see Contraindications (    4   )  ].



     5.3        Hypersensitivity Reactions  



  In postmarketing experience, serious hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis) have been reported following VIBERZI administration. Some of these reactions occurred after the first one or two doses of VIBERZI [ see Adverse Reactions (    6.2   )]  .



 Instruct patients to immediately stop VIBERZI and seek medical attention if they experience symptoms suggestive of a hypersensitivity reaction [ see Contraindications (    4   )  ].



     5.4        Constipation  



  Constipation, sometimes requiring hospitalization, has been reported following VIBERZI administration. In postmarketing experience, severe cases with development of intestinal obstruction, intestinal perforation, and fecal impaction, requiring intervention, have also been reported. Instruct patients to stop VIBERZI and immediately contact their healthcare provider if they experience severe constipation. Avoid use with other drugs that may cause constipation [ see Adverse Reactions (    6.1   ), Drug Interactions (    7   )  ].
