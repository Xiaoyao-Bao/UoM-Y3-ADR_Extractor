  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The safety data described below for adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older are based on 3 clinical trials of 2 to 6 weeks duration and one 52-week trial. In the 3 trials of 2 to 6 weeks duration, 1524 patients (495 males and 1029 females, ages 12 to 86 years old) with seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis were treated with OMNARIS Nasal Spray 200, 100, 50, or 25 mcg or placebo once daily. The racial distribution in these three trials included 1374 Caucasians, 69 Blacks, 31 Asians, and 50 patients classified as Other. The 52-week trial was conducted in 663 patients (227 males and 436 females, ages 12 to 73 years old) treated with OMNARIS Nasal Spray 200 mcg or placebo once daily. The racial distribution in this trial included 538 Caucasians, 69 Blacks, 16 Asians, and 40 patients classified as Other. The data from pediatric patients are based upon 4 clinical trials in which 1541 children (871 males and 670 females, ages 2 to 11 years old) with seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis were treated with OMNARIS Nasal Spray 200, 100, or 25 mcg or placebo once daily for 2 to 12 weeks. The racial distribution in these four trials included 1136 Caucasians, 273 Blacks, 20 Asians, and 112 patients classified as Other.



     Adults and Adolescents 12 Years of Age and Older in Short-Term (2-6 weeks) Trials:    In three short-term trials conducted in the US and Canada, 546 patients were treated with OMNARIS Nasal Spray 200 mcg daily. Adverse reactions did not differ appreciably based on age, gender, or race. Approximately 2% of patients treated with OMNARIS Nasal Spray 200 mcg in clinical trials discontinued because of adverse reactions; this rate was similar for patients treated with placebo. The table below displays reactions that occurred with an incidence of 2% or greater and more frequently with OMNARIS Nasal Spray 200 mcg than with placebo in clinical trials of 2 to 6 weeks in duration.

             Pediatric Patients Aged 6 to 11 Years in Short-Term (2-12 weeks) Trials:    In two short-term trials, conducted in the US and Canada, 913 patients were treated with OMNARIS Nasal Spray 200 mcg, 100 mcg or 25 mcg daily. Adverse events did not differ appreciably based on age, gender, or race. In clinical trials, 1.6% and 2.7% of patients treated with OMNARIS Nasal Spray 200 mcg or 100 mcg, respectively, discontinued because of adverse reactions; these rates were lower than the rate in patients treated with placebo (2.8%).  Table 2  displays adverse events that occurred with an incidence of 3% or greater and more frequently with OMNARIS Nasal Spray 200 mcg than with placebo.

             Pediatric Patients Aged 2 to 5 Years in Short-Term (6-12 weeks) Trials:    In two short-term trials conducted in the US, 183 patients were treated with OMNARIS Nasal Spray 200 mcg, 100 mcg or 25 mcg daily. The distribution of adverse events was similar to that seen in the 6 to 11 year old children.
 

     Long-Term (52-Week) Safety Trial:    In a 52-week double-blind, placebo-controlled safety trial that included 663 adults and adolescent patients (441 treated with ciclesonide: 227 males and 436 females) with perennial allergic rhinitis, the adverse reaction profile over the treatment period was similar to the adverse event profile in trials of shorter duration. Adverse reactions, irrespective of drug relationship, that occurred with an incidence of 3% or greater and more frequently with OMNARIS Nasal Spray 200 mcg than with placebo were epistaxis, pharyngolaryngeal pain, sinusitis, headache, nasal discomfort, cough, bronchitis, influenza, back pain, and urinary tract infection. No patient experienced a nasal septal perforation or nasal ulcer during this long-term trial of OMNARIS Nasal Spray.



   6.2 Post-Marketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been reported in association with post-marketing use of OMNARIS Nasal Spray and are not listed above: nasal congestion, nasal ulcer and dizziness. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *    Epistaxis, Candida albicans infection, nasal septal perforation, impaired wound healing. Monitor patients periodically for signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa. Avoid spraying OMNARIS directly onto the nasal septum. Avoid use in patients with recent nasal ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma. (  5.1  ) 
 *    Development of glaucoma or cataracts. Monitor patients closely with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts. (  5.2  ) 
 *    Potential worsening of existing tuberculosis; fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections, or ocular herpes simplex. More serious or even fatal course of chickenpox or measles in susceptible patients. Use caution in patients with the above because of the potential for worsening of these infections. (  5.3  ) 
 *    Hypercorticism and adrenal suppression with very high dosages or at the regular dosage in susceptible individuals. If such changes occur, discontinue OMNARIS Nasal Spray slowly. (  5.4  ) 
 *    Potential reduction in growth velocity in children. Monitor growth routinely in pediatric patients receiving OMNARIS Nasal Spray. (  5.5  ,  8.4  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Local Nasal Effects



   Epistaxis  : In clinical studies of 2 to 52 weeks' duration, epistaxis was observed more frequently in patients treated with OMNARIS Nasal Spray than those who received placebo [see Adverse Reactions (  6  )]  .



   Candida  Infection  : In clinical studies with OMNARIS Nasal Spray, the development of localized infections of the nose and pharynx with Candida albicans  has occurred. When such an infection develops, it may require treatment with appropriate local therapy and discontinuation of OMNARIS Nasal Spray. Therefore, patients using OMNARIS Nasal Spray over several months or longer should be examined periodically for evidence of Candida  infection or other signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa.



  Nasal Septal Perforation  : Instances of nasal septal perforation have been reported in patients following the intranasal application of corticosteroids. No cases of nasal septal perforation were identified in clinical studies with OMNARIS Nasal Spray. Avoid spraying OMNARIS Nasal Spray directly onto the nasal septum.



  Impaired Wound Healing  : Because of the inhibitory effect of corticosteroids on wound healing, patients who have experienced recent nasal septal ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma should not use a nasal corticosteroid until healing has occurred.



    5.2 Glaucoma and Cataracts



  Nasal and inhaled corticosteroids may result in the development of glaucoma and/or cataracts. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts.



 The risk of glaucoma was evaluated by assessments of intraocular pressure in 3 studies including 943 patients. Of these, 390 adolescents or adults were treated for up to 52 weeks and 186 children ages 2 to 11 received treatment with OMNARIS Nasal Spray 200 mcg daily for up to 12 weeks. In these studies, no significant differences in intraocular pressure changes were observed between OMNARIS Nasal Spray 200 mcg and placebo-treated patients. Additionally, no significant differences between OMNARIS Nasal Spray 200 mcg and placebo-treated patients were noted during the 52-week study of adults and adolescent patients in whom thorough ophthalmologic assessments were performed, including evaluation of cataract formation using slit lamp examinations.



    5.3 Immunosuppression



  Patients who are using drugs that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids. In children or adults who have not had these diseases or been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If a patient is exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If a patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.



 Corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculosis infections of the respiratory tract; or in patients with untreated local or systemic fungal or bacterial infections; systemic viral or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex because of the potential for worsening of these infections.



    5.4 Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Effect



   Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression  : When intranasal corticosteroids are used at higher than recommended dosages or in susceptible individuals at recommended dosages, systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression may appear. If such changes occur, the dosage of OMNARIS Nasal Spray should be discontinued slowly, consistent with accepted procedures for discontinuing oral steroid therapy.



 The replacement of a systemic corticosteroid with a topical corticosteroid can be accompanied by signs of adrenal insufficiency. In addition, some patients may experience symptoms of corticosteroid withdrawal, e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, and depression. Patients previously treated for prolonged periods with systemic corticosteroids and transferred to topical corticosteroids should be carefully monitored for acute adrenal insufficiency in response to stress. In those patients who have asthma or other clinical conditions requiring long-term systemic corticosteroid treatment, rapid decreases in systemic corticosteroid dosages may cause a severe exacerbation of their symptoms.



    5.5 Effect on Growth



  Corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. Monitor the growth routinely (e.g., via stadiometry) in pediatric patients receiving OMNARIS Nasal Spray.
