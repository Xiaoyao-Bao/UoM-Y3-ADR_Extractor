  In clinical trials, a broad variety of serious adverse reactions were observed in 1,010 subjects who received PEGASYS at doses of 180 mcg for 48 weeks, alone or in combination with COPEGUS  (r)    [see  Boxed Warning  and  Warnings and Precautions (5)  ]  . The most common life-threatening or fatal events induced or aggravated by PEGASYS and COPEGUS include depression, suicide, relapse of drug abuse/overdose, and bacterial infections, each occurring at a frequency of less than 1%. Hepatic decompensation occurred in 2% (10/574) of CHC/HIV subjects  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.9)  ]  .



    EXCERPT:    *  Adult subjects: The most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than 40%) are fatigue/asthenia, pyrexia, myalgia, and headache (  6.1  ) 
 *  Pediatric subjects: The most common adverse reactions are similar to those seen in adults (  6.1  )

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying and controlled conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug, and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



     Chronic Hepatitis C  



     Adult Subjects  



 In all hepatitis C studies, one or more serious adverse reactions occurred in 10% of CHC monoinfected subjects and in 19% of CHC/HIV subjects receiving PEGASYS alone or in combination with COPEGUS. The most common serious adverse reactions (3% in CHC and 5% in CHC/HIV) was bacterial infection (e.g., sepsis, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, pyelonephritis, pneumonia). Other SAEs occurred at a frequency of less than 1% and included: suicide, suicidal ideation, aggression, anxiety, drug abuse and drug overdose, angina, hepatic dysfunction, fatty liver, cholangitis, arrhythmia, diabetes mellitus, autoimmune phenomena (e.g., hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis), peripheral neuropathy, aplastic anemia, peptic ulcer, gastrointestinal bleeding, pancreatitis, colitis, corneal ulcer, pulmonary embolism, coma, myositis, cerebral hemorrhage, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, psychotic disorder, and hallucination.



 In clinical trials, 98 to 99 percent of subjects experienced one or more adverse reactions. For hepatitis C subjects, the most commonly reported adverse reactions were psychiatric reactions, including depression, insomnia, irritability, anxiety, and flu-like symptoms such as fatigue, pyrexia, myalgia, headache, and rigors. Other common reactions were anorexia, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, arthralgias, injection site reactions, alopecia, and pruritus.  Table 7  displays pooled rates of adverse reactions occurring in greater than 5% of subjects in the PEGASYS monotherapy and PEGASYS/COPEGUS combination therapy clinical trials.



 Overall 11% of CHC monoinfected subjects receiving 48 weeks of therapy with PEGASYS either alone or in combination with COPEGUS discontinued therapy; 16% of CHC/HIV coinfected subjects discontinued therapy. The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy were psychiatric, flu-like syndrome (e.g., lethargy, fatigue, headache), dermatologic and gastrointestinal disorders, and laboratory abnormalities (thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia).



 Overall 39% of subjects with CHC or CHC/HIV required modification of PEGASYS and/or COPEGUS therapy. The most common reasons for dose modification of PEGASYS in CHC and CHC/HIV subjects was for neutropenia (20% and 27%, respectively) and thrombocytopenia (4% and 6%, respectively). The most common reason for dose modification of COPEGUS in CHC and CHC/HIV subjects was anemia (22% and 16%, respectively). PEGASYS dose was reduced in 12% of subjects receiving 1000 mg to 1200 mg COPEGUS for 48 weeks and in 7% of subjects receiving 800 mg COPEGUS for 24 weeks. COPEGUS dose was reduced in 21% of subjects receiving 1000 mg to 1200 mg COPEGUS for 48 weeks and in 12% of subjects receiving 800 mg COPEGUS for 24 weeks.



 Chronic hepatitis C monoinfected subjects treated for 24 weeks with PEGASYS and 800 mg COPEGUS were observed to have lower incidence of serious adverse reactions (3% vs. 10%), Hgb less than 10 g/dL (3% vs. 15%), dose modification of PEGASYS (30% vs. 36%) and COPEGUS (19% vs. 38%) and of withdrawal from treatment (5% vs. 15%) compared to subjects treated for 48 weeks with PEGASYS and 1000 mg or 1200 mg COPEGUS. The overall incidence of adverse reactions appeared to be similar in the two treatment groups.

               Pediatric Subjects  
 

 In a clinical trial with 114 pediatric subjects (5 to 17 years of age) treated with PEGASYS alone or in combination with COPEGUS, dose modifications were required in approximately one-third of subjects, most commonly for neutropenia and anemia. In general, the safety profile observed in pediatric subjects was similar to that seen in adults. In the pediatric study, the most prevalent adverse events in subjects treated with combination therapy for up to 48 weeks with PEGASYS and COPEGUS were influenza-like illness (91%), upper respiratory tract infection (60%), headache (64%), gastrointestinal disorder (56%), skin disorder (47%), and injection-site reaction (45%). Seven subjects receiving combination PEGASYS and COPEGUS treatment for 48 weeks discontinued therapy for safety reasons (depression, psychiatric evaluation abnormal, transient blindness, retinal exudates, hyperglycemia, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and anemia). Most of the adverse events reported in the study were mild or moderate in severity. Severe adverse events were reported in 2 subjects in the PEGASYS plus COPEGUS combination therapy group (hyperglycemia and cholecystectomy).

         In pediatric subjects randomized to combination therapy, the incidence of most adverse reactions were similar for the entire treatment period (up to 48 weeks plus 24 weeks follow-up) in comparison to the first 24 weeks, and increased only slightly for headache, gastrointestinal disorder, irritability and rash. The majority of adverse reactions occurred in the first 24 weeks of treatment.
 

     Growth inhibition in CHC pediatric subjects [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.15)  ]  .



 Pediatric subjects treated with PEGASYS plus ribavirin combination therapy showed a delay in weight and height increases up to 48 weeks of therapy compared with baseline. Both weight and height for age z-scores as well as the percentiles of the normative population for subject weight and height decreased during treatment. At the end of 2 years follow-up after treatment, most subjects had returned to baseline normative curve percentiles for weight (64  th  mean percentile at baseline, 60  th  mean percentile at 2 years post-treatment) and height (54  th  mean percentile at baseline, 56  th  mean percentile at 2 years post-treatment). At the end of treatment, 43% (23 of 53) of subjects experienced a weight percentile decrease of more than 15 percentiles, and 25% (13 of 53) experienced a height percentile decrease of more than 15 percentiles on the normative growth curves. At 2 years post-treatment, 16% (6 of 38) of subjects were more than 15 percentiles below their baseline weight curve and 11% (4 of 38) were more than 15 percentiles below their baseline height curve.



 Thirty-eight of the 114 subjects enrolled in the long-term follow-up study extending up to 6 years post-treatment. For most subjects, post-treatment recovery in growth at 2 years post-treatment was maintained to 6 years post-treatment.



     CHC with HIV Coinfection (Adults)  



 The adverse reaction profile of coinfected subjects treated with PEGASYS/COPEGUS in Study 7 was generally similar to that shown for monoinfected subjects in Study 4 (  Table 7  ). Events occurring more frequently in coinfected subjects were neutropenia (40%), anemia (14%), thrombocytopenia (8%), weight decrease (16%), and mood alteration (9%).



     Chronic Hepatitis B  



     Adult Subjects  



 In clinical trials of 48 week treatment duration, the adverse reaction profile of PEGASYS in CHB was similar to that seen in CHC PEGASYS monotherapy use, except for exacerbations of hepatitis  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.9)  ]  . Six percent of PEGASYS-treated subjects in the hepatitis B studies experienced one or more serious adverse reactions.



 The most common or important serious adverse reactions, all of which occurred at a frequency of less than or equal to 1%, in the hepatitis B studies were infections (sepsis, appendicitis, tuberculosis, influenza), hepatitis B flares, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.



 One serious adverse reaction of anaphylactic shock occurred in a dose ranging study of 191 subjects in a subject taking a higher than the approved dose of PEGASYS.



 The most commonly observed adverse reactions in the PEGASYS and lamivudine groups, respectively, were pyrexia (54% vs. 4%), headache (27% vs. 9%), fatigue (24% vs. 10%), myalgia (26% vs. 4%), alopecia (18% vs. 2%), and anorexia (16% vs. 3%).



 Overall 5% of hepatitis B subjects discontinued PEGASYS therapy and 40% of subjects required modification of PEGASYS dose. The most common reason for dose modification in subjects receiving PEGASYS therapy was for laboratory abnormalities including neutropenia (20%), thrombocytopenia (13%), and ALT elevation (11%).



     Pediatric Subjects  



 In a clinical trial with 111 subjects 3 to 17 years of age treated with PEGASYS for 48 weeks, the safety profile was consistent with that seen in adults with CHB and in pediatric subjects with CHC. The most commonly observed adverse reactions in PEGASYS-treated patients were pyrexia (51%), headache (21%), abdominal pain (17%), cough (15%), vomiting (15%), influenza-like illness (14%), alanine aminotransferase increased (10%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (10%), rash (10%), asthenia (9.0%), epistaxis (9.0%), nausea (9.0%), fatigue (8%), upper respiratory tract infection (8%), alopecia (6%), decreased appetite (6%), dizziness (6%), and nasopharyngitis (6%).



     Growth inhibition in CHB pediatric subjects [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.15)  ]  .



 The mean changes from baseline in z-scores for height and weight for age were -0.07 and -0.21 for PEGASYS-treated subjects at Week 48. Comparable findings were observed in untreated patients at Week 48 (changes in z-scores for height and weight for age were -0.01 and -0.08, respectively). At Week 48 of PEGASYS treatment, a height or weight decrease of more than 15 percentiles on the normative growth curves was observed in 6% of subjects for height and 11% of subjects for weight. At 24 weeks after the end of PEGASYS treatment the percentage of subjects with decrease of more than 15 percentiles from baseline were 12% for height and 12% for weight. No data are available on longer term follow-up post-treatment in these subjects.



     Laboratory Values  



     Adult Subjects  



 The laboratory test values observed in the hepatitis B trials (except where noted below) were similar to those seen in the PEGASYS monotherapy CHC trials.



     Neutrophils  



 In the hepatitis C studies, decreases in neutrophil count below normal were observed in 95% of all subjects treated with PEGASYS either alone or in combination with COPEGUS. Severe potentially life-threatening neutropenia (ANC less than 500 cells/mm  3  ) occurred in 5% of CHC subjects and 12% of CHC/HIV subjects receiving PEGASYS either alone or in combination with COPEGUS. Modification of PEGASYS dose for neutropenia occurred in 17% of subjects receiving PEGASYS monotherapy and 22% of subjects receiving PEGASYS/COPEGUS combination therapy. In the CHC/HIV subjects 27% required modification of interferon dosage for neutropenia. Two percent of subjects with CHC and 10% of subjects with CHC/HIV required permanent reductions of PEGASYS dosage and less than 1% required permanent discontinuation. Median neutrophil counts return to pre-treatment levels 4 weeks after cessation of therapy  [see  Dosage and Administration (2.6)  ].  



     Lymphocytes  



 Decreases in lymphocyte count are induced by interferon alpha therapy. PEGASYS plus COPEGUS combination therapy induced decreases in median total lymphocyte counts (56% in CHC and 40% in CHC/HIV, with median decrease of 1170 cells/mm  3  in CHC and 800 cells/mm  3  in CHC/HIV). In the hepatitis C studies, lymphopenia was observed during both monotherapy (81%) and combination therapy with PEGASYS and COPEGUS (91%). Severe lymphopenia (less than 500 cells/mm  3  ) occurred in approximately 5% of all monotherapy subjects and 14% of all combination PEGASYS and COPEGUS therapy recipients. Dose adjustments were not required by protocol. The clinical significance of the lymphopenia is not known.



 In CHC with HIV coinfection, CD4 counts decreased by 29% from baseline (median decrease of 137 cells/mm  3  ) and CD8 counts decreased by 44% from baseline (median decrease of 389 cells/mm  3  ) in the PEGASYS plus COPEGUS combination therapy arm. Median lymphocyte CD4 and CD8 counts return to pre-treatment levels after 4 to 12 weeks of the cessation of therapy. CD4% did not decrease during treatment.



     Platelets  



 In the hepatitis C studies, platelet counts decreased in 52% of CHC subjects and 51% of CHC/HIV subjects treated with PEGASYS alone (respectively median decrease of 41% and 35% from baseline), and in 33% of CHC subjects and 47% of CHC/HIV subjects receiving combination therapy with COPEGUS (median decrease of 30% from baseline). Moderate to severe thrombocytopenia (less than 50,000 cells/mm  3  ) was observed in 4% of CHC and 8% of CHC/HIV subjects. Median platelet counts return to pre-treatment levels 4 weeks after the cessation of therapy.



     Hemoglobin  



 In the hepatitis C studies, the hemoglobin concentration decreased below 12 g/dL in 17% (median Hgb reduction of 2.2 g/dL) of monotherapy and 52% (median Hgb reduction of 3.7 g/dL) of combination therapy subjects. Severe anemia (Hgb less than 10 g/dL) was encountered in 13% of all subjects receiving combination therapy and in 2% of CHC subjects and 8% of CHC/HIV subjects receiving PEGASYS monotherapy. Dose modification for anemia in COPEGUS recipients treated for 48 weeks occurred in 22% of CHC subjects and 16% of CHC/HIV subjects  [see  Dosage and Administration (2.6)  ].  



     Triglycerides  



 Triglyceride levels are elevated in subjects receiving alfa interferon therapy and were elevated in the majority of subjects participating in clinical studies receiving either PEGASYS alone or in combination with COPEGUS. Random levels greater than or equal to 400 mg/dL were observed in about 20% of CHC subjects. Severe elevations of triglycerides (greater than 1000 mg/dL) occurred in 2% of CHC monoinfected subjects.



 In HCV/HIV coinfected subjects, fasting levels greater than or equal to 400 mg/dL were observed in up to 36% of subjects receiving either PEGASYS alone or in combination with COPEGUS. Severe elevations of triglycerides (greater than 1000 mg/dL) occurred in 7% of coinfected subjects.



     ALT Elevations  



     Chronic Hepatitis C  



 One percent of subjects in the hepatitis C trials experienced marked elevations (5- to 10-fold above the upper limit of normal) in ALT levels during treatment and follow-up. These transaminase elevations were on occasion associated with hyperbilirubinemia and were managed by dose reduction or discontinuation of study treatment. Liver function test abnormalities were generally transient. One case was attributed to autoimmune hepatitis, which persisted beyond study medication discontinuation  [see  Dosage and Administration (2.6)  ].  



     Chronic Hepatitis B  



 Transient ALT elevations are common during hepatitis B therapy with PEGASYS. Twenty-five percent and 27% of subjects experienced elevations of 5 to 10 * ULN and 12% and 18% had elevations of greater than 10 * ULN during treatment of HBeAg negative and HBeAg positive disease, respectively. Flares have been accompanied by elevations of total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase and less commonly with prolongation of PT and reduced albumin levels. Eleven percent of subjects had dose modifications due to ALT flares and less than 1% of subjects were withdrawn from treatment  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.9)  and  Dosage and Administration (2.6)  ].  



 ALT flares of 5 to 10 * ULN occurred in 13% and 16% of subjects, while ALT flares of greater than 10 * ULN occurred in 7% and 12% of subjects in HBeAg-negative and HBeAg-positive disease, respectively, after discontinuation of PEGASYS therapy.



     Thyroid Function  



 PEGASYS alone or in combination with COPEGUS was associated with the development of abnormalities in thyroid laboratory values, some with associated clinical manifestations. In the hepatitis C studies, hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism requiring treatment, dose modification or discontinuation occurred in 4% and 1% of PEGASYS treated subjects and 4% and 2% of PEGASYS and COPEGUS treated subjects, respectively. Approximately half of the subjects, who developed thyroid abnormalities during PEGASYS treatment, still had abnormalities during the follow-up period  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.6)  ]  .



     Pediatric Subjects  



 Decreases in hemoglobin, neutrophils and platelets may require dose reduction or permanent discontinuation from treatment in pediatric subjects  [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3  ,  2.5  ,  2.6)  ]  . Most laboratory abnormalities noted during the CHC clinical trial (    Table 9    ) returned to baseline levels shortly after completion of treatment.

         In patients randomized to combination therapy, the incidence of abnormalities during the entire treatment phase (up to 48 weeks plus 24 weeks follow-up) in comparison to the first 24 weeks increased slightly for neutrophils between 500 and 1,000 cells/mm  3  and hemoglobin values between 8.5 and 10 g/dL. The majority of hematologic abnormalities occurred in the first 24 weeks of treatment.
 

 The hematologic laboratory abnormalities observed in the CHB pediatric trial were similar to those observed in the CHC pediatric trial.



   6.2 Immunogenicity

  As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to peginterferon alfa-2a in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading.



     Chronic Hepatitis C  



 Nine percent (71/834) of subjects treated with PEGASYS with or without COPEGUS developed binding antibodies to interferon alfa-2a, as assessed by an ELISA assay. Three percent of subjects (25/835) receiving PEGASYS with or without COPEGUS, developed low-titer neutralizing antibodies (using an assay with a sensitivity of 100 INU/mL).



     Chronic Hepatitis B  



 Twenty-nine percent (42/143) of hepatitis B subjects treated with PEGASYS for 24 weeks developed binding antibodies to interferon alfa-2a, as assessed by an ELISA assay. Thirteen percent of subjects (19/143) receiving PEGASYS developed low-titer neutralizing antibodies (using an assay with a sensitivity of 100 INU/mL).



 The clinical and pathological significance of the appearance of serum neutralizing antibodies is unknown. No apparent correlation of antibody development to clinical response or adverse events was observed. The percentage of subjects whose test results were considered positive for antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assays.



   6.3 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified and reported during post-approval use of PEGASYS therapy. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Blood and lymphatic system disorders:  pure red cell aplasia



   Ear and labyrinth disorders:  hearing impairment, hearing loss



   Gastrointestinal disorders:  tongue pigmentation



   Immune system disorders:  liver graft rejection and renal graft rejection  [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.8)  ]  



   Infections and infestations:  limb abscess



   Metabolism and nutrition disorders:  dehydration



   Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:  serious skin reactions



   Neurological:  seizures

    Risk of Serious Disorders  



   Alpha interferons, including PEGASYS (peginterferon alfa-2a), may cause or aggravate fatal or life-threatening neuropsychiatric, autoimmune, ischemic, and infectious disorders. Patients should be monitored closely with periodic clinical and laboratory evaluations. Therapy should be withdrawn in patients with persistently severe or worsening signs or symptoms of these conditions. In many, but not all cases, these disorders resolve after stopping PEGASYS therapy     [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.2  ,   5.5  ,   5.8  ,   5.11  ,   5.14  ,   5.16)  ,   Adverse Reactions (6.1)   and   Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)  ].

   5.1 Pregnancy: Use with Ribavirin



   Ribavirin may cause birth defects and/or death of the exposed fetus.  Patients must avoid pregnancy (female patients or female partners of male patients) while taking PEGASYS and ribavirin combination therapy. Ribavirin therapy should not be started unless a confirmed negative pregnancy test has been obtained immediately prior to initiation of therapy. Women of childbearing potential and men must use two forms of effective contraception during treatment and for at least 6 months after treatment has concluded. Routine monthly pregnancy tests must be performed during this time [see  Contraindications (4)  ,  Patient Counseling Information (17)  and ribavirin labeling]  .



    5.2 Neuropsychiatric Reactions



  Life-threatening or fatal neuropsychiatric reactions may manifest in all patients receiving therapy with PEGASYS and include suicide, suicidal ideation, homicidal ideation, depression, relapse of drug addiction, and drug overdose. These reactions may occur in patients with and without previous psychiatric illness.



 PEGASYS should be used with extreme caution in all patients who report a history of depression. Neuropsychiatric adverse events observed with alpha interferon treatment include aggressive behavior, psychoses, hallucinations, bipolar disorders, and mania. Physicians should monitor all patients for evidence of depression and other psychiatric symptoms. Patients should be advised to report any sign or symptom of depression or suicidal ideation to their prescribing physicians. In severe cases, therapy should be stopped immediately and psychiatric intervention instituted [see  Boxed Warning  ,  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  and  Dosage and Administration (2.6)  ]  .



    5.3 Cardiovascular Disorders



  Hypertension, supraventricular arrhythmias, chest pain, and myocardial infarction have been observed in patients treated with PEGASYS. PEGASYS should be administered with caution to patients with pre-existing cardiac disease. Because cardiac disease may be worsened by ribavirin-induced anemia, patients with a history of significant or unstable cardiac disease should not receive PEGASYS/ribavirin [see ribavirin prescribing information]  .



    5.4 Bone Marrow Suppression



  PEGASYS suppresses bone marrow function and may result in severe cytopenias. Ribavirin may potentiate the neutropenia and lymphopenia induced by alpha interferons including PEGASYS. Very rarely, alpha interferons may be associated with aplastic anemia. It is advised that complete blood counts (CBC) be obtained pre-treatment and monitored routinely during therapy [see ribavirin prescribing information]  .



 PEGASYS/ribavirin should be used with caution in patients with baseline neutrophil counts less than 1,500 cells/mm  3  , with baseline platelet counts less than 90,000 cells/mm  3  or baseline hemoglobin less than 10 g/dL. PEGASYS therapy should be discontinued, at least temporarily, in patients who develop severe decreases in neutrophil and/or platelet counts [see  Dosage and Administration (2.6)  ]  .



 Severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occur with a greater incidence in HIV coinfected patients than monoinfected patients and may result in serious infections or bleeding [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



 Pancytopenia (marked decreases in RBCs, neutrophils and platelets) and bone marrow suppression have been reported in the literature to occur within 3 to 7 weeks after the concomitant administration of pegylated interferon/ribavirin and azathioprine. In this limited number of patients (n=8), myelotoxicity was reversible within 4 to 6 weeks upon withdrawal of both HCV antiviral therapy and concomitant azathioprine and did not recur upon reintroduction of either treatment alone. PEGASYS, ribavirin, and azathioprine should be discontinued for pancytopenia, and pegylated interferon/ribavirin should not be re-introduced with concomitant azathioprine.



    5.5 Autoimmune Disorders



  Development or exacerbation of autoimmune disorders including myositis, hepatitis, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, interstitial nephritis, thyroiditis, and systemic lupus erythematosus have been reported in patients receiving alpha interferon. PEGASYS should be used with caution in patients with autoimmune disorders [see  Boxed Warning  ]  .



    5.6 Endocrine Disorders



  PEGASYS causes or aggravates hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. Hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and diabetes mellitus have been observed to develop in patients treated with PEGASYS. Patients with these conditions at baseline who cannot be effectively treated by medication should not begin PEGASYS therapy. Patients who develop these conditions during treatment and cannot be controlled with medication may require discontinuation of PEGASYS therapy.



    5.7 Ophthalmologic Disorders



  Decrease or loss of vision, retinopathy including macular edema, retinal artery or vein thrombosis, retinal hemorrhages and cotton wool spots, optic neuritis, papilledema and serous retinal detachment are induced or aggravated by treatment with PEGASYS or other alpha interferons. All patients should receive an eye examination at baseline. Patients with pre-existing ophthalmologic disorders (e.g., diabetic or hypertensive retinopathy) should receive periodic ophthalmologic exams during interferon alpha treatment. Any patient who develops ocular symptoms should receive a prompt and complete eye examination. PEGASYS treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new or worsening ophthalmologic disorders.



    5.8 Cerebrovascular Disorders



  Ischemic and hemorrhagic cerebrovascular events have been observed in patients treated with interferon alfa-based therapies, including PEGASYS. Events occurred in patients with few or no reported risk factors for stroke, including patients less than 45 years of age. Because these are spontaneous reports, estimates of frequency cannot be made and a causal relationship between interferon alfa-based therapies and these events is difficult to establish [see  Boxed Warning  ]  .



    5.9 Hepatic Failure and Hepatitis Exacerbations



  Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients with cirrhosis may be at risk of hepatic decompensation and death when treated with alpha interferons, including PEGASYS. Cirrhotic CHC patients coinfected with HIV receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and interferon alfa-2a with or without ribavirin appear to be at increased risk for the development of hepatic decompensation compared to patients not receiving HAART. In Study 7 [see  Clinical Studies (14.3)  ]  , among 129 CHC/HIV cirrhotic subjects receiving HAART, 14 (11%) of these subjects across all treatment arms developed hepatic decompensation resulting in 6 deaths. All 14 subjects were on NRTIs, including stavudine, didanosine, abacavir, zidovudine, and lamivudine. These small numbers of patients do not permit discrimination between specific NRTIs for the associated risk. During treatment, patients' clinical status and hepatic function should be closely monitored, and PEGASYS/ribavirin treatment should be immediately discontinued in patients with hepatic decompensation [see  Contraindications (4)  ]  .



 Exacerbations of hepatitis during hepatitis B therapy are not uncommon and are characterized by transient and potentially severe increases in serum ALT. Chronic hepatitis B subjects experienced transient acute exacerbations (flares) of hepatitis B (ALT elevation greater than 10-fold higher than the upper limit of normal) during PEGASYS treatment (12% and 18%) and post-treatment (7% and 12%) in HBeAg-negative and HBeAg-positive subjects, respectively. Marked transaminase flares while on PEGASYS therapy have been accompanied by other liver test abnormalities. Patients experiencing ALT flares should receive more frequent monitoring of liver function. PEGASYS dose reduction should be considered in patients experiencing transaminase flares. If ALT increases are progressive despite reduction of PEGASYS dose or are accompanied by increased bilirubin or evidence of hepatic decompensation, PEGASYS should be immediately discontinued [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  and  Dosage and Administration (2.6)  ]  .



    5.10 Pulmonary Disorders



  Dyspnea, pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonia, bronchiolitis obliterans, interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary hypertension and sarcoidosis, some resulting in respiratory failure and/or patient deaths, may be induced or aggravated by PEGASYS or alpha interferon therapy. Recurrence of respiratory failure has been observed with interferon rechallenge. PEGASYS combination treatment should be suspended in patients who develop pulmonary infiltrates or pulmonary function impairment. Patients who resume interferon treatment should be closely monitored.



    5.11 Infections



  While fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of high or persistent fever must be ruled out, particularly in patients with neutropenia. Serious and severe infections (bacterial, viral, or fungal), some fatal, have been reported during treatment with alpha interferons including PEGASYS. Appropriate anti-infective therapy should be started immediately and discontinuation of therapy should be considered [see  Boxed Warning  ]  .



    5.12 Colitis



  Ulcerative and hemorrhagic/ischemic colitis, sometimes fatal, have been observed within 12 weeks of starting alpha interferon treatment. Abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and fever are the typical manifestations of colitis. PEGASYS should be discontinued immediately if these symptoms develop. The colitis usually resolves within 1 to 3 weeks of discontinuation of alpha interferon.



    5.13 Pancreatitis



  Pancreatitis, sometimes fatal, has occurred during alpha interferon and ribavirin treatment. PEGASYS/ribavirin should be suspended if symptoms or signs suggestive of pancreatitis are observed. PEGASYS/ribavirin should be discontinued in patients diagnosed with pancreatitis.



    5.14 Hypersensitivity



  Severe acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, and anaphylaxis) have been observed during alpha interferon and ribavirin therapy. If such reaction occurs, therapy with PEGASYS/ribavirin should be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy immediately instituted. Serious skin reactions including vesiculobullous eruptions, reactions in the spectrum of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (erythema multiforme major) with varying degrees of skin and mucosal involvement and exfoliative dermatitis (erythroderma) have been reported in patients receiving PEGASYS with and without ribavirin. Patients developing signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions must discontinue therapy [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ]  .



    5.15 Impact on Growth in Pediatric Patients



   Growth inhibition was observed in CHC pediatric subjects 5 to 17 years of age during combination therapy for up to 48 weeks with PEGASYS plus ribavirin. At the end of treatment, 43% of subjects were more than 15 percentiles below their baseline weight curve, and 25% of subjects were more than 15 percentiles below their baseline height curve. At the end of 2 years follow-up after treatment, most subjects had returned to baseline normative curve percentiles for weight and height; 16% of subjects were more than 15 percentiles below their baseline weight curve and 11% were more than 15 percentiles below their baseline height curve.  



 The available longer term data on subjects who were followed up to 6 years post-treatment are too limited to determine the risk of reduced adult height in some patients [see  Clinical Trials Experience (6.1)  ]  .



 Growth inhibition was also observed in CHB pediatric subjects 3 to 17 years of age during therapy with PEGASYS lasting up to 48 weeks. At Week 48 of treatment 11% of subjects were more than 15 percentiles below their baseline weight curve and 6% were more than 15 percentiles below their baseline height curve. At 24 weeks after the end of treatment, 12% of subjects were more than 15 percentiles below their baseline weight curve and 12% were more than 15 percentiles below their baseline height curve. No data are available on longer term follow-up post-treatment in these patients [see  Clinical Trials Experience (6.1)  ].  



    5.16 Peripheral Neuropathy



  Peripheral neuropathy has been reported when alpha interferons were given in combination with telbivudine. In one clinical trial, an increased risk and severity of peripheral neuropathy was observed with the combination use of telbivudine and PEGASYS as compared to telbivudine alone. The safety and efficacy of telbivudine in combination with interferons for the treatment of CHB have not been demonstrated.



    5.17 Laboratory Tests



  Before beginning PEGASYS or PEGASYS combination therapy, standard hematological and biochemical laboratory tests are recommended for all patients. Pregnancy screening for women of childbearing potential must be performed. Patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities should have electrocardiograms administered before treatment with PEGASYS/ribavirin.



 After initiation of therapy, hematological tests should be performed at 2 weeks and 4 weeks and biochemical tests should be performed at 4 weeks. Additional testing should be performed periodically during therapy. In adult clinical studies, the CBC (including hemoglobin level and white blood cell and platelet counts) and chemistries (including liver function tests and uric acid) were measured at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks, and then every 4 to 6 weeks or more frequently if abnormalities were found. In a pediatric clinical trial, hematological and chemistry assessments were at 1, 3, 5, and 8 weeks, then every 4 weeks. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was measured every 12 weeks. Monthly pregnancy testing should be performed during combination therapy and for 6 months after discontinuing therapy.



 The entrance criteria used for the clinical studies of PEGASYS may be considered as a guideline to acceptable baseline values for initiation of treatment:



 *  Platelet count greater than or equal to 90,000 cells/mm  3  (as low as 75,000 cells/mm  3  in HCV subjects with cirrhosis or 70,000 cells/mm  3  in subjects with CHC and HIV) 
 *  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1,500 cells/mm  3   
 *  Serum creatinine concentration less than 1.5 * upper limit of normal 
 *  TSH and T4within normal limits or adequately controlled thyroid function 
 *  CD4+ cell count greater than or equal to 200 cells/mm  3  or CD4+ cell count greater than or equal to 100 cells/mm  3  but less than 200 cells/mm  3  and HIV-1 RNA less than 5,000 copies/mL in subjects coinfected with HIV 
 *  Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 12 g/dL for women and greater than or equal to 13 g/dL for men in CHC monoinfected subjects 
 *  Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 11 g/dL for women and greater than or equal to 12 g/dL for men in subjects with CHC and HIV
