      6.1 Clinical Trial Experience
   Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The clinical trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of Daysee was a 12-month, randomized, multicenter, open-label study, which enrolled women aged 18 to 40, of whom 1,006 took at least one dose of Daysee.



     Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation    



 16.3% of the women discontinued from the clinical trial due to an adverse reaction; the most common adverse reactions (&gt;= 1% of women) leading to discontinuation were irregular and/or heavy uterine bleeding (5.9%), weight gain (2.4%), mood changes (1.5%), and acne (1.0%).



     Common Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions (&gt;= 5% of women)    



 Irregular and/or heavy uterine bleeding (17%), weight gain (5%), acne (5%).



     Serious Adverse Reactions    



 Migraine, cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, pancreatitis, abdominal pain, and major depressive disorder.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Daysee. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency of establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

  WARNING: CIGARETTE SMOKING AND SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS

  EXCERPT:     WARNING: CIGARETTE SMOKING AND SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS  



   See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.  



 *  Women who are over 35 years old and smoke should not use Daysee. 
 *  Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from combination oral contraceptive (COC) use. 
    
 

    Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from combination oral contraceptives (COC) use. This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked. For this reason, COCs should not be used by women who are over 35 years of age and smoke. [  See     CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)  ]  



 





    BOXED WARNING: 17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

  17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

  See   FDA - Approved Patient Labeling  



 *  Counsel patients that cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from COC use, and that women who are over 35 years old and smoke should not use COCs. 
 *  Counsel patients that this product does not protect against HIV-infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases. 
 *  Counsel patients on Warnings and Precautions associated with COCs. 
 *  Counsel patients to take one tablet daily by mouth at the same time every day. Instruct patients what to do in the event pills are missed. See WHAT TO DO IF YOU MISS PILLS section of FDA-Approved Patient Labeling. 
 *  Counsel patients to use a back-up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. 
 *  Counsel patients who are breastfeeding or who desire to breastfeed that COCs may reduce breast milk production. This is less likely to occur if breastfeeding is well established. 
 *  Counsel any patient who starts COCs postpartum, and who has not yet had a period, to use an additional method of contraception until she has taken a light blue tablet for 7 consecutive days. 
 *  Counsel patients that amenorrhea may occur. Pregnancy should be considered in the event of amenorrhea, and should be ruled out if amenorrhea is associated with symptoms of pregnancy, such as morning sickness or unusual breast tenderness.

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Vascular risks: Stop Daysee if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop Daysee at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start Daysee no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding.  (5.1)   
 *  Liver disease: Discontinue Daysee if jaundice occurs.  (5.3)   
 *  High blood pressure: Do not prescribe Daysee for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease.  (5.4)   
 *  Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking Daysee. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias.  (5.6)   
 *  Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue Daysee if indicated.  (5.7)   
 *  Uterine bleeding: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea.  (5.8)   
    
 

   5.1 Thrombotic and Other Vascular Events



  Stop Daysee if an arterial or deep venous thrombotic event occurs. Although the use of COCs increases the risk of venous thromboembolism, pregnancy increases the risk of venous thromboembolism as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of venous thromboembolism in women using COCs is 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The excess risk is highest during the first year of use of a COC. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued.



 Use of Daysee provides women with more hormonal exposure on a yearly basis than conventional monthly oral contraceptives containing the same strength synthetic estrogens and progestins (an additional 9 and 13 weeks of exposure to progestin and estrogen, respectively, per year).



 If feasible, stop Daysee at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism.



 Start Daysee no earlier than 4 to 6 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week.



 COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (&gt;35 years of age), and hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors.



 Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors.



 Stop Daysee if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately.



    5.2 Carcinoma of the Breast and Cervix



  Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use Daysee because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive.



 There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings.



 Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings are due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors.



    5.3 Liver Disease



  Discontinue Daysee if jaundice develops. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded.



 Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage.



 Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (&gt; 8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users.



 Oral contraceptive-related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. Women with a history of COC-related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use.



     5.4 Risk of Liver Enzyme Elevations with Concomitant Hepatitis C Treatment  



   During clinical trials with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen that contains obmitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, ALT elevations greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), including some cases greater than 20 times the ULN, were significantly more frequent in women using ethinyl estradiol-containing medications, such as COCs. Discontinue Daysee prior to starting therapy with the combination drug regimen ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (  4  )  ]. Daysee can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen.  



    5.5 High Blood Pressure



  For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Daysee if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs.



 An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin.



    5.6 Gallbladder Disease



  Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users.



    5.7 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects



  Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking Daysee. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion.



 Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs.



 Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs.



    5.8 Headache



  If a woman taking Daysee develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Daysee if indicated.



 An increase in frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) may be a reason for immediate discontinuation of the COC.



    5.9 Bleeding Irregularities



  Unscheduled (breakthrough) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first 3 months of use. If bleeding persists, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC.



 When prescribing Daysee, the convenience of fewer planned menses (4 per year instead of 13 per year) should be weighed against the inconvenience of increased unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting. The primary clinical trial (PSE-301) that evaluated the efficacy of Daysee also assessed unscheduled bleeding. The participants in the 12-month clinical trial (N=1,006) completed the equivalent of 8,681 28-day cycles of exposure and were composed primarily of women who had used oral contraceptives previously (89%) as opposed to new users (11%). A total of 82 (8.2%) of the women discontinued Daysee, at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting.



 Scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding and/or spotting remained fairly constant over time, with an average of 3 days of bleeding and/or spotting per each 91-day cycle. Unscheduled bleeding and unscheduled spotting decreased over successive 91-day cycles. Table 1 below presents the number of days with unscheduled bleeding in treatment cycles 1 and 4. Table 2 presents the number of days with unscheduled spotting in treatment cycles 1 and 4.

  Figure 1: Percent of Women Taking Daysee who Reported Unscheduled Bleeding and/or Spotting or only Unscheduled Bleeding  



 Amenorrhea sometimes occurs in women who are using COCs. Pregnancy should be ruled out in the event of amenorrhea. Some women may encounter amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after stopping COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.



    5.10 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy



  Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned, when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Oral contraceptive use should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed.



 The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see   USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1)  ].  



    5.11 Emotional Disorders



  Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and Daysee discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree.



    5.12 Interference with Laboratory Tests



  The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid binding globulin increase with use of COCs.



    5.13 Monitoring



  A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated health care.



    5.14 Other Conditions



  In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking COCs.
