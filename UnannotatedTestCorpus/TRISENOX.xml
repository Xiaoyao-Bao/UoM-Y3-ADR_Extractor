    6.1 Clinical Trials Experience  

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 Newly-Diagnosed Low-Risk APL



 The safety evaluation of TRISENOX in combination with tretinoin is based on results from a randomized trial comparing TRISENOX plus tretinoin (n=129) versus chemotherapy plus tretinoin (n=137) in patients with newly-diagnosed APL (Study APL0406)  [see Clinical Studies (  14.1  )]  .  In the TRISENOX/tretinoin group, 98% of patients completed induction therapy and 89% completed at least three consolidation cycles. In the chemotherapy/tretinoin group, 96% completed induction therapy and 87% patients completed all three courses of consolidation therapy.



 Fatal adverse reactions were reported in 1 (1%) patient on the TRISENOX/tretinoin arm and 8 (6%) patients on the chemotherapy/tretinoin arm.  TRISENOX/tretinoin was discontinued due to toxicity in 1 patient during induction and in 4 patients during the first three consolidation courses, whereas chemotherapy/tretinoin was discontinued due to toxicity in 4 patients during induction and in 6 patients during consolidation.  Serious adverse reactions reported in 25% on the TRISENOX/ tretinoin arm and 24% on the chemotherapy/tretinoin arm. The serious adverse reactions reported in &gt;= 2% of patients receiving TRISENOX/tretinoin were abnormal liver tests, differentiation syndrome, dyspnea, pneumonia, and other infections.



 Selected hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities that occurred during induction or consolidation are presented in Table 4 for the 129 patients treated with TRISENOX plus tretinoin and the 137 patients treated with chemotherapy plus tretinoin.

 Relapsed or Refractory APL



 Safety information was available for 52 patients with relapsed or refractory APL who participated in clinical trials of TRISENOX.  Forty patients in the Phase 2 study received the recommended dose of 0.15 mg/kg, of whom 28 completed both induction and consolidation treatment cycles. An additional 12 patients with relapsed or refractory APL received doses generally similar to the recommended dose. Most patients experienced some drug-related toxicity, most commonly leukocytosis, gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain), fatigue, edema, hyperglycemia, dyspnea, cough, rash or itching, headaches, and dizziness. These adverse effects have not been observed to be permanent or irreversible nor do they usually require interruption of therapy.



 SAEs, Grade &gt;=3 according to version 2 of the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria, were common. Those SAEs attributed to TRISENOX in the Phase 2 study of 40 patients with refractory or relapsed APL included APL differentiation syndrome (n=3), hyperleukocytosis (n=3), QTc interval &gt;= 500 msec (n=16, 1 with torsade de pointes), atrial dysrhythmias (n=2), and hyperglycemia (n=2).



 Table 5 describes the adverse reactions that were observed in &gt;= 5% patients, between the ages of 5-73 years, treated for APL with TRISENOX at the recommended dose. Similar adverse reactions profiles were seen in the other patient populations who received TRISENOX.

               Leukocytosis  :  TRISENOX in combination with tretinoin can induce proliferation of leukemic promyelocytes resulting in a rapid increase in white blood cell count. Leukocytosis greater than 10 Gi/L developed during induction therapy in 43% patients receiving TRISENOX/tretinoin for newly-diagnosed low-risk APL and in 50% of patients receiving TRISENOX monotherapy for relapsed/refractory APL. In the relapsed/refractory setting, a relationship did not exist between baseline WBC counts and development of hyperleukocytosis nor baseline WBC counts and peak WBC counts. Hyperleukocytosis due to TRISENOX may warrant treatment with hydroxyurea  [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  )]  .

    BOXED WARNING: 

  

    WARNING: DIFFERENTIATION SYNDROME AND CARDIAC CONDUCTION ABNORMALITIES  



   Differentiation Syndrome: Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) treated with TRISENOX have experienced symptoms of differentiation syndrome, which can be fatal if not treated. Symptoms may include fever, dyspnea, acute respiratory distress, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural or pericardial effusions, weight gain or peripheral edema, hypotension, and renal, hepatic, or multi-organ dysfunction, in the presence or absence of leukocytosis. If differentiation syndrome is suspected, immediately initiate high-dose corticosteroid therapy and hemodynamic monitoring until resolution of signs and symptoms. Temporary discontinuation of TRISENOX may be required   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  ) and Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )].    



     Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities: Arsenic trioxide can cause QTc interval prolongation, complete atrioventricular block, and a torsade de pointes-type ventricular arrhythmia, which can be fatal. Before initiating therapy, assess the QTc interval, correct pre-existing electrolyte abnormalities, and consider discontinuing drugs known to prolong QTc interval. Do not administer TRISENOX to patients with ventricular arrhythmia or prolonged QTcF   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )].      



   EXCERPT:     WARNING: DIFFERENTIATION SYNDROME AND     CARDIAC CONDUCTION ABNORMALITIES   



     See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.    



 *  Patients treated with TRISENOX may develop differentiation syndrome, which can be fatal. If symptoms occur, initiate high-dose steroids immediately and monitor hemodynamics. (5.1) 
 *  TRISENOX can cause QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia, which can be fatal.  Before administering TRISENOX, assess the QT interval, correct electrolyte abnormalities, and consider discontinuing drugs known to prolong QT interval.  Do not administer TRISENOX to patients with ventricular arrhythmia or prolonged QTcF. (2.3, 5.2)

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings and precautions">     5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  



   EXCERPT:    *  Hepatotoxicity: Grade &gt;=3 elevations in hepatic transaminase elevation have occurred in patients with newly diagnosed low or intermediate risk APL treated with TRISENOX in combination with tretinoin. Monitor hepatic function tests at least twice weekly during TRISENOX therapy. (  5.3  ) 
 *  Carcinogenesis: Arsenic trioxide is a human carcinogen. Monitor patients for the development of second primary malignancies. (  5.4  ) 
 *  Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise of potential risk to a fetus and use of effective contraception. (  5.5  ,  8.1  ,  8.3  ) 
    
 

    5.1 Differentiation Syndrome  



  Differentiation syndrome, which may be life-threatening or fatal, has been observed in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) treated with TRISENOX.  In clinical trials, 16-23% of patients treated with TRISENOX for APL developed differentiation syndrome.  Symptoms include unexplained fever, dyspnea, hypoxia, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural or pericardial effusion, weight gain, peripheral edema, hypotension, renal insufficiency, hepatopathy and multi-organ dysfunction.  Differentiation syndrome has been observed with and without concomitant hyperleukocytosis, and it has occurred as early as day 1 of induction to as late as the second month induction therapy. When TRISENOX is used in combination with tretinoin, prednisone prophylaxis is advised [see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  )]  .



 At the first signs of differentiation syndrome, interrupt treatment with TRISENOX and administer dexamethasone 10 mg intravenously twice daily.  Continue high-dose steroids until signs and symptoms have abated for at least 3 days [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  )]  . 



     5.2 Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities  



  Patients treated with TRISENOX can develop QTc prolongation, torsade de pointes, and complete heart block.  In the clinical trials of patients with newly-diagnosed low-risk APL treated with TRISENOX in combination with tretinoin, 11% experienced QTc prolongation &gt; 450 msec for men and &gt; 460 msec for women throughout the treatment cycles. In the clinical trial of patients with relapsed or refractory APL treated with TRISENOX monotherapy, 40% had at least one ECG tracing with a QTc interval greater than 500 msec. A prolonged QTc was observed between 1 and 5 weeks after start of TRISENOX infusion, and it usually resolved by 8 weeks after TRISENOX infusion. There are no data on the effect of TRISENOX on the QTc interval during the infusion of the drug.



 The risk of torsade de pointes is related to the extent of QTc prolongation, concomitant administration of QTc prolonging drugs, a history of torsade de pointes, pre-existing QTc interval prolongation, congestive heart failure, administration of potassium-wasting diuretics, or other conditions that result in hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia. The risk may be increased when TRISENOX is coadministered with medications that can lead to electrolyte abnormalities (such as diuretics or amphotericin B) [see Drug Interactions (  7  )]  .



 Prior to initiating therapy with TRISENOX, assess the QTc interval by electrocardiogram, correct pre-existing electrolyte abnormalities, and consider discontinuing drugs known to prolong QTc interval.  Do not administer TRISENOX to patients with ventricular arrhythmia or prolonged QTc.  If possible, discontinue drugs that are known to prolong the QTc interval. If it is not possible to discontinue the interacting drug, perform cardiac monitoring frequently [see Drug Interactions (  7  )]  . During TRISENOX therapy, maintain potassium concentrations above 4 mEq/L and magnesium concentrations above 1.8 mg/dL.  Monitor ECG weekly, and more frequently for clinically unstable patients. 



 For patients who develop a QTc greater than 500 msec, immediately withhold treatment with TRISENOX and any medication known to prolong the QTc interval.  Correct electrolyte abnormalities. When the QTc normalizes, resume TRISENOX at a reduced dose [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  )]  . 



     5.3 Hepatotoxicity  



  In the clinical trials, 44% of patients with newly-diagnosed low-risk APL treated with TRISENOX in combination with tretinoin experienced elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, and/or serum bilirubin.  These abnormalities resolved with temporary discontinuation of TRISENOX and/or tretinoin.  During treatment with TRISENOX, monitor liver chemistries at least 2-3 times per week through recovery from toxicities.  Withhold treatment with TRISENOX and/or tretinoin if elevations in AST), alkaline phosphatase, and/or serum bilirubin occur to greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  )]  .



 Long-term liver abnormalities can occur in APL patients treated with TRISENOX in combination with tretinoin.  In a published series, mild liver dysfunction and hepatic steatosis were seen in 15% and 43%, respectively, of patients at a median of 7 years (range 0-14 years) after treatment with arsenic trioxide in combination with tretinoin.



     5.4 Carcinogenesis  



  The active ingredient of TRISENOX, arsenic trioxide, is a human carcinogen. Monitor patients for the development of second primary malignancies. 



     5.5 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity  



  TRISENOX can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Arsenic trioxide was embryolethal and teratogenic in rats when administered on gestation day 9 at a dose approximately 10 times the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m2 basis. A related trivalent arsenic, sodium arsenite, produced teratogenicity when administered during gestation in mice at a dose approximately 5 times the projected human dose on a mg/m2 basis and in hamsters at an intravenous dose approximately equivalent to the projected human daily dose on a mg/m2 basis. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females and males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and after treatment with TRISENOX [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  ,  8.3  )]  .
