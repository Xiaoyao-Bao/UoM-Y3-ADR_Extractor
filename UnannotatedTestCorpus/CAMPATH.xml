  The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label:



 *  Cytopenias [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  
 *  Infusion Reactions [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]  
 *  Immunosuppression/Infections [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  
    The most common adverse reactions with CAMPATH are: infusion reactions (pyrexia, chills, hypotension, urticaria, nausea, rash, tachycardia, dyspnea), cytopenias (neutropenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia), infections (CMV viremia, CMV infection, other infections), gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, emesis, abdominal pain), and neurological symptoms (insomnia, anxiety). The most common serious adverse reactions are cytopenias, infusion reactions, and immunosuppression/infections.
 

   EXCERPT:   Most common adverse reactions (&gt;=10%): cytopenias, infusion reactions, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and other infections, nausea, emesis, diarrhea, and insomnia. (  6  )

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The data below reflect exposure to CAMPATH in 296 patients with CLL of whom 147 were previously untreated and 149 received at least 2 prior chemotherapy regimens. The median duration of exposure was 11.7 weeks for previously untreated patients and 8 weeks for previously treated patients.



     Lymphopenia  



 Severe lymphopenia and a rapid and sustained decrease in lymphocyte subsets occurred in previously untreated and previously treated patients following administration of CAMPATH. In previously untreated patients, the median CD4+ was 0 cells/muL at one month after treatment and 238 cells/muL [25%-75% interquartile range 115 to 418 cells/muL at 6 months post treatment  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ].  



     Neutropenia  



 In previously untreated patients, the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was 42% with a median time to onset of 31 days and a median duration of 37 days. In previously treated patients, the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was 64% with a median duration of 28 days. Ten percent of previously untreated patients and 17% of previously treated patients received granulocyte colony stimulating factors.



     Anemia  



 In previously untreated patients, the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 anemia was 12% with a median time to onset of 31 days and a median duration of 8 days. In previously treated patients, the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 anemia was 38%. Seventeen percent of previously untreated patients and 66% of previously treated patients received either erythropoiesis stimulating agents, transfusions or both.



     Thrombocytopenia  



 In previously untreated patients, the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was 14% with a median time to onset of 9 days and a median duration of 14 days. In previously treated patients, the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was 52% with a median duration of 21 days. Autoimmune thrombocytopenia was reported in 2% of previously treated patients with one fatality.



     Infusion Reactions  



 Infusion reactions, which included pyrexia, chills, hypotension, urticaria, and dyspnea, were common. Grade 3 and 4 pyrexia and/or chills occurred in approximately 10% of previously untreated patients and in approximately 35% of previously treated patients. The occurrence of infusion reactions was greatest during the initial week of treatment and decreased with subsequent doses of CAMPATH. All patients were pretreated with antipyretics and antihistamines; additionally, 43% of previously untreated patients received glucocorticoid pre-treatment.



     Infections  



 In the study of previously untreated patients, patients were tested weekly for CMV using a PCR assay from initiation through completion of therapy, and every 2 weeks for the first 2 months following therapy. CMV infection occurred in 16% (23/147) of previously untreated patients; approximately one-third of these infections were serious or life threatening. In studies of previously treated patients in which routine CMV surveillance was not required, CMV infection was documented in 6% (9/149) of patients; nearly all of these infections were serious or life threatening.



 Other infections were reported in approximately 50% of patients across all studies. Grade 3 to 5 sepsis ranged from 3% to 10% across studies and was higher in previously treated patients. Grade 3 to 4 febrile neutropenia ranged from 5% to 10% across studies and was higher in previously treated patients. Infection-related fatalities occurred in 2% of previously untreated patients and 16% of previously treated patients. There were 198 episodes of other infection in 109 previously untreated patients; 16% were bacterial, 7% were fungal, 4% were other viral, and in 73% the organism was not identified.



     Cardiac  



 Cardiac dysrhythmias occurred in approximately 14% of previously untreated patients. The majority were tachycardias and were temporally associated with infusion; dysrhythmias were Grade 3 or 4 in 1% of patients.



     Previously Untreated Patients  



 Table 1 contains selected adverse reactions observed in 294 patients randomized (1:1) to receive CAMPATH or chlorambucil as first line therapy for B-CLL. CAMPATH was administered at a dose of 30 mg intravenously three times weekly for up to 12 weeks. The median duration of therapy was 11.7 weeks with a median weekly dose of 82 mg (25-75% interquartile range: 69-90 mg).

 Additional safety information was obtained from 3 single arm studies of 149 previously treated patients with CLL administered 30 mg CAMPATH intravenously three times weekly for 4 to 12 weeks (median cumulative dose 673 mg [range 2-1106 mg]; median duration of therapy 8.0 weeks). Adverse reactions in these studies not listed in Table 1 that occurred at an incidence rate of &gt;5% were fatigue, nausea, emesis, musculoskeletal pain, anorexia, dysesthesia, mucositis, and bronchospasm.



   6.2 Immunogenicity

  As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. Using an ELISA assay, anti-human antibodies (HAHA) were detected in 11 of 133 (8.3%) previously untreated patients. In addition, two patients were weakly positive for neutralizing activity. Limited data suggest that the anti-CAMPATH antibodies did not adversely affect tumor response. Four of 211 (1.9%) previously treated patients were found to have antibodies to CAMPATH following treatment.



 The incidence of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to CAMPATH with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.



   6.3 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of alemtuzumab. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Fatal infusion reactions



 Cardiovascular: congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, decreased ejection fraction (some patients had been previously treated with cardiotoxic agents).



 Gastrointestinal: Acute acalculous cholecystitis



 Immune disorders: Goodpasture's syndrome, Graves' disease, aplastic anemia, Guillain Barre syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, serum sickness, fatal transfusion associated graft versus host disease.



 Infections: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) including EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorder, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), reactivation of latent viruses.



 Metabolic: tumor lysis syndrome.



 Neurologic: optic neuropathy.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: CYTOPENIAS, INFUSION REACTIONS, and INFECTIONS

    WARNING: CYTOPENIAS, INFUSION REACTIONS, and INFECTIONS  

  EXCERPT:   WARNING: CYTOPENIAS, INFUSION REACTIONS, and INFECTIONS



   See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.  



   Serious, including fatal, cytopenias, infusion reactions, and infections can occur (5.1- 5.3).  



 *  Limit doses to 30 mg (single) and 90 mg (cumulative weekly); higher doses increase risk of pancytopenia. (2.1) 
 *  Escalate dose gradually and monitor patients during infusion. Withhold therapy for Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions. (5.2) 
 *  Administer prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) and herpes virus infections. (2.2, 5.3) 
    
 

      Cytopenias  : Serious, including fatal, pancytopenia/marrow hypoplasia, autoimmune idiopathic thrombocytopenia, and autoimmune hemolytic anemia can occur in patients receiving CAMPATH. Single doses of CAMPATH greater than 30 mg or cumulative doses greater than 90 mg per week increase the incidence of pancytopenia   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ].    



       Infusion Reactions  : CAMPATH administration can result in serious, including fatal, infusion reactions. Carefully monitor patients during infusions and withhold CAMPATH for Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions. Gradually escalate CAMPATH to the recommended dose at the initiation of therapy and after interruption of therapy for 7 or more days   [see   Dosage and Administration (2)   and   Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]  .  



       Infections  : Serious, including fatal, bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoan infections can occur in patients receiving CAMPATH. Administer prophylaxis against   Pneumocystis jiroveci   pneumonia (PCP) and herpes virus infections   [see   Dosage and Administration (2.2)   and   Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  .  
</Section>
    <Section id="S3" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



  EXCERPT:    Cytopenias:  



 *  Obtain complete blood counts (CBC) and platelet counts at weekly intervals during therapy and CD4 counts after therapy until recovery to &gt;=200 cells/uL. (  5.4  ) 
 *  Discontinue for autoimmune or severe hematologic adverse reactions. (  5.1  ) 
     Infections:  
 

 *  CAMPATH induces severe and prolonged lymphopenia and increases risk of infection. If a serious infection occurs, withhold treatment until infection resolves. (  5.3  ) 
 *  Do not administer live viral vaccines to patients who have recently received CAMPATH. (  5.5  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Cytopenias



  Severe, including fatal, autoimmune anemia and thrombocytopenia, and prolonged myelosuppression have been reported in patients receiving CAMPATH.



 In addition, hemolytic anemia, pure red cell aplasia, bone marrow aplasia, and hypoplasia have been reported after treatment with CAMPATH at the recommended dose. Single doses of CAMPATH greater than 30 mg or cumulative doses greater than 90 mg per week increase the incidence of pancytopenia.



 Withhold CAMPATH for severe cytopenias (except lymphopenia). Discontinue for autoimmune cytopenias or recurrent/persistent severe cytopenias (except lymphopenia) [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  . No data exist on the safety of CAMPATH resumption in patients with autoimmune cytopenias or marrow aplasia [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



    5.2 Infusion Reactions



  Adverse reactions occurring during or shortly after CAMPATH infusion include pyrexia, chills/rigors, nausea, hypotension, urticaria, dyspnea, rash, emesis, and bronchospasm. In clinical trials, the frequency of infusion reactions was highest in the first week of treatment. Monitor for the signs and symptoms listed above and withhold infusion for Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



 The following serious, including fatal, infusion reactions have been identified in postmarketing reports: syncope, pulmonary infiltrates, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), respiratory arrest, cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, acute cardiac insufficiency, cardiac arrest, angioedema, and anaphylactoid shock.



 Initiate CAMPATH according to the recommended dose-escalation scheme [see  Dosage and Administration (2)  ]  . Premedicate patients with an antihistamine and acetaminophen prior to dosing. Institute medical management (e.g., glucocorticoids, epinephrine, meperidine) for infusion reactions as needed [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  . If therapy is interrupted for 7 or more days, reinstitute CAMPATH with gradual dose escalation [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)    and   Adverse Reactions (6)  ].  



    5.3 Immunosuppression/Infections



  CAMPATH treatment results in severe and prolonged lymphopenia with a concomitant increased incidence of opportunistic infections [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Administer PCP and herpes viral prophylaxis during CAMPATH therapy and for a minimum of 2 months after completion of CAMPATH or until the CD4+ count is &gt;=200 cells/uL, whichever occurs later [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  . Prophylaxis does not eliminate these infections.



 Routinely monitor patients for CMV infection during CAMPATH treatment and for at least 2 months following completion of treatment. Withhold CAMPATH for serious infections and during antiviral treatment for CMV infection or confirmed CMV viremia (defined as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive CMV in &gt;=2 consecutive samples obtained 1 week apart) [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Initiate therapeutic ganciclovir (or equivalent) for CMV infection or confirmed CMV viremia [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .



 Administer only irradiated blood products to avoid transfusion associated Graft versus Host Disease (TAGVHD), unless emergent circumstances dictate immediate transfusion.  1  



 In patients receiving CAMPATH as initial therapy, recovery of CD4+ counts to &gt;=200 cells/uL occurred by 6 months post treatment; however at 2 months post treatment, the median was 183 cells/uL. In previously treated patients receiving CAMPATH, the median time to recovery of CD4+ counts to &gt;=200 cells/uL was 2 months; however, full recovery (to baseline) of CD4+ and CD8+ counts may take more than 12 months [see  Boxed Warning  and  Adverse Reactions (6)  ]  .



    5.4 Laboratory Monitoring



  Obtain complete blood counts (CBC) at weekly intervals during CAMPATH therapy and more frequently if worsening anemia, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia occurs. Assess CD4+ counts after treatment until recovery to &gt;=200 cells/uL [see  Dosage and Administration (5.3)  and  Adverse Reactions (6)  ]  .



    5.5 Immunization



  The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines following CAMPATH therapy has not been studied. Do not administer live viral vaccines to patients who have recently received CAMPATH. The ability to generate an immune response to any vaccine following CAMPATH therapy has not been studied.
