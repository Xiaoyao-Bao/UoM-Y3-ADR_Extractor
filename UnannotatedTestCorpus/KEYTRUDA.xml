  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The data described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS section reflect exposure to KEYTRUDA as a single agent in 2799 patients in three randomized, open-label, active-controlled clinical trials (KEYNOTE-002, KEYNOTE-006, and KEYNOTE-010), which enrolled 912 patients with melanoma and 682 patients with NSCLC, and one single-arm trial (KEYNOTE-001), which enrolled 655 patients with melanoma and 550 patients with NSCLC. In addition, these data reflect exposure to KEYTRUDA as a single agent in a non-randomized, open-label, multi-cohort trial (KEYNOTE-012), which enrolled 192 patients with HNSCC and in two non-randomized, open-label trials (KEYNOTE-013 and KEYNOTE-087), which enrolled 241 patients with cHL; in combination with chemotherapy in a randomized, active-controlled trial (KEYNOTE-189), which enrolled 405 patients with nonsquamous NSCLC; and in post-marketing use. Across all trials, KEYTRUDA was administered at doses of 2 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks, 10 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks, 10 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks, or 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks. Among the 2799 patients, 41% were exposed for 6 months or more and 21% were exposed for 12 months or more.



 The data described in this section were obtained in six randomized, controlled clinical trials (KEYNOTE-002, KEYNOTE-006, KEYNOTE-010, KEYNOTE-045, KEYNOTE-189, and KEYNOTE-407) in which KEYTRUDA was administered to 912 patients with melanoma, 1188 patients with NSCLC, and 542 patients with urothelial carcinoma, and seven non-randomized, open-label trials (KEYNOTE-012, KEYNOTE-087, KEYNOTE-170, KEYNOTE-052, KEYNOTE-059, KEYNOTE-158, and KEYNOTE-224) in which KEYTRUDA was administered to 192 patients with HNSCC, 210 patients with cHL, 53 patients with PMBCL, 370 patients with urothelial carcinoma, 259 patients with gastric cancer, 98 patients with cervical cancer, and 104 patients with HCC. In these trials, KEYTRUDA was administered at 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks, 200 mg every 3 weeks, or 10 mg/kg every 2 or 3 weeks.



     Melanoma  



     Ipilimumab-Naive Melanoma  



 The safety of KEYTRUDA for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma who had not received prior ipilimumab and who had received no more than one prior systemic therapy was investigated in Study KEYNOTE-006. KEYNOTE-006 was a multicenter, open-label, active-controlled trial where patients were randomized (1:1:1) and received KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (n=278) or KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks (n=277) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 doses unless discontinued earlier for disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (n=256)  [see  Clinical Studies (14.1)  ]  . Patients with autoimmune disease, a medical condition that required systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medication; a history of interstitial lung disease; or active infection requiring therapy, including HIV or hepatitis B or C, were ineligible.



 The median duration of exposure was 5.6 months (range: 1 day to 11.0 months) for KEYTRUDA and similar in both treatment arms. Fifty-one and 46% of patients received KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg every 2 or 3 weeks, respectively, for &gt;=6 months. No patients in either arm received treatment for more than one year.



 The study population characteristics were: median age of 62 years (range: 18 to 89 years), 60% male, 98% White, 32% had an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) value at baseline, 65% had M1c stage disease, 9% with history of brain metastasis, and approximately 36% had been previously treated with systemic therapy which included a BRAF inhibitor (15%), chemotherapy (13%), and immunotherapy (6%).



 In KEYNOTE-006, the adverse reaction profile was similar for the every 2 week and every 3 week schedule, therefore summary safety results are provided in a pooled analysis (n=555) of both KEYTRUDA arms. Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA occurred in 9% of patients. Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 21% of patients; the most common (&gt;=1%) was diarrhea (2.5%). The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) were fatigue and diarrhea. Table 2 and Table 3 summarize the incidence of selected adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities that occurred in patients receiving KEYTRUDA.

     Ipilimumab-Refractory Melanoma  



 The safety of KEYTRUDA in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with disease progression following ipilimumab and, if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor, was evaluated in Study KEYNOTE-002. KEYNOTE-002 was a multicenter, partially blinded (KEYTRUDA dose), randomized (1:1:1), active-controlled trial in which 528 patients received KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg (n=178) or 10 mg/kg (n=179) every 3 weeks or investigator's choice of chemotherapy (n=171), consisting of dacarbazine (26%), temozolomide (25%), paclitaxel and carboplatin (25%), paclitaxel (16%), or carboplatin (8%)  [see  Clinical Studies (14.1)  ]  . The trial excluded patients with autoimmune disease, severe immune-related toxicity related to ipilimumab, defined as any Grade 4 toxicity or Grade 3 toxicity requiring corticosteroid treatment (greater than 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent dose) for greater than 12 weeks; medical conditions that required systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medication; a history of interstitial lung disease; or an active infection requiring therapy, including HIV or hepatitis B or C.



 The median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks was 3.7 months (range: 1 day to 16.6 months) and to KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks was 4.8 months (range: 1 day to 16.8 months). The data described below reflect exposure to KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg in 36% of patients exposed to KEYTRUDA for &gt;=6 months and in 4% of patients exposed for &gt;=12 months. In the KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg arm, 41% of patients were exposed to KEYTRUDA for &gt;=6 months and 6% of patients were exposed to KEYTRUDA for &gt;=12 months.



 The study population characteristics were: median age of 62 years (range: 15 to 89 years), 61% male, 98% White, 41% with an elevated LDH value at baseline, 83% with M1c stage disease, 73% received two or more prior therapies for advanced or metastatic disease (100% received ipilimumab and 25% a BRAF inhibitor), and 15% with history of brain metastasis.



 In KEYNOTE-002, the adverse reaction profile was similar for the 2 mg/kg dose and 10 mg/kg dose, therefore summary safety results are provided in a pooled analysis (n=357) of both KEYTRUDA arms. Adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation occurred in 12% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA; the most common (&gt;=1%) were general physical health deterioration (1%), asthenia (1%), dyspnea (1%), pneumonitis (1%), and generalized edema (1%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 14% of patients; the most common (&gt;=1%) were dyspnea (1%), diarrhea (1%), and maculo-papular rash (1%). The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) of KEYTRUDA were fatigue, pruritus, rash, constipation, nausea, diarrhea, and decreased appetite.

     NSCLC  



     First-line treatment of metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy  



 The safety of KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and investigator's choice of platinum (either carboplatin or cisplatin) was investigated in Study KEYNOTE-189, a multicenter, double-blind, randomized (2:1), active-controlled trial in patients with previously untreated, metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. A total of 607 patients received KEYTRUDA 200 mg, pemetrexed and platinum every 3 weeks for 4 cycles followed by KEYTRUDA and pemetrexed (n=405) or placebo, pemetrexed, and platinum every 3 weeks for 4 cycles followed by placebo and pemetrexed (n=202). Patients with autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment; a medical condition that required immunosuppression; or who had received more than 30 Gy of thoracic radiation within the prior 26 weeks were ineligible  [see  Clinical Studies (14.2)  ]  .



 The median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA 200 mg every 3 weeks was 7.2 months (range: 1 day to 20.1 months). Sixty percent of patients in the KEYTRUDA arm were exposed to KEYTRUDA for &gt;=6 months. Seventy-two percent of patients received carboplatin. The study population characteristics were: median age of 64 years (range: 34 to 84), 49% age 65 years or older, 59% male, 94% White and 3% Asian, and 18% with history of brain metastases at baseline.



 KEYTRUDA was discontinued for adverse reactions in 20% of patients. The most common adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA were pneumonitis (3%) and acute kidney injury (2%). Adverse reactions leading to the interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 53% of patients; the most common adverse reactions or laboratory abnormalities leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA (&gt;=2%) were neutropenia (13%), asthenia/fatigue (7%), anemia (7%), thrombocytopenia (5%), diarrhea (4%), pneumonia (4%), increased blood creatinine (3%), dyspnea (2%), febrile neutropenia (2%), upper respiratory tract infection (2%), increased ALT (2%), and pyrexia (2%).

               First-line treatment of metastatic squamous NSCLC with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy  
 

 The safety of KEYTRUDA in combination with carboplatin and investigator's choice of either paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel was investigated in Study KEYNOTE-407, a multicenter, double-blind, randomized (1:1), placebo-controlled trial in 558 patients with previously untreated, metastatic squamous NSCLC. Safety data are available for the first 203 patients who received KEYTRUDA and chemotherapy (n=101) or placebo and chemotherapy (n=102). Patients with autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment; a medical condition that required immunosuppression; or who had received more than 30 Gy of thoracic radiation within the prior 26 weeks were ineligible  [see  Clinical Studies (14.2)  ]  .



 The median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA was 7 months (range: 1 day to 12 months). Sixty-one percent of patients in the KEYTRUDA arm were exposed to KEYTRUDA for &gt;=6 months. A total of 139 of 203 patients (68%) received paclitaxel and 64 patients (32%) received nab-paclitaxel in combination with carboplatin. The study population characteristics were: median age of 65 years (range: 40 to 83); 52% age 65 or older; 78% male; 83% White; and 9% with history of brain metastases.



 KEYTRUDA was discontinued for adverse reactions in 15% of patients, with no single type of adverse reaction accounting for the majority. Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 43% of patients; the most common (&gt;=2%) were thrombocytopenia (20%), neutropenia (11%), anemia (6%), asthenia (2%), and diarrhea (2%). The most frequent (&gt;=2%) serious adverse reactions were febrile neutropenia (6%), pneumonia (6%), and urinary tract infection (3%).



 The adverse reactions observed in KEYNOTE-407 were similar to those observed in KEYNOTE-189 with the exception that increased incidences of alopecia (47% vs. 36%) and peripheral neuropathy (31% vs. 25%) were observed in the KEYTRUDA and chemotherapy arm compared to the placebo and chemotherapy arm in KEYNOTE-407.



     Previously Treated NSCLC  



 The safety of KEYTRUDA was investigated in Study KEYNOTE-010, a multicenter, open-label, randomized (1:1:1), active-controlled trial, in patients with advanced NSCLC who had documented disease progression following treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy and, if positive for EGFR or ALK genetic aberrations, appropriate therapy for these aberrations. A total of 991 patients received KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg (n=339) or 10 mg/kg (n=343) every 3 weeks or docetaxel (n=309) at 75 mg/m  2  every 3 weeks. Patients with autoimmune disease, medical conditions that required systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medication, or who had received more than 30 Gy of thoracic radiation within the prior 26 weeks were ineligible.



 The median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks was 3.5 months (range: 1 day to 22.4 months) and to KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks was 3.5 months (range 1 day to 20.8 months). The data described below reflect exposure to KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg in 31% of patients exposed to KEYTRUDA for &gt;=6 months. In the KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg arm, 34% of patients were exposed to KEYTRUDA for &gt;=6 months.



 The study population characteristics were: median age of 63 years (range: 20 to 88), 42% age 65 years or older, 61% male, 72% white and 21% Asian, 8% with advanced localized disease, 91% with metastatic disease, and 15% with history of brain metastases. Twenty-nine percent received two or more prior systemic treatments for advanced or metastatic disease.



 In KEYNOTE-010, the adverse reaction profile was similar for the 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg dose, therefore summary safety results are provided in a pooled analysis (n=682). Treatment was discontinued for adverse reactions in 8% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA. The most common adverse events resulting in permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA was pneumonitis (1.8%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 23% of patients; the most common (&gt;=1%) were diarrhea (1%), fatigue (1.3%), pneumonia (1%), liver enzyme elevation (1.2%), decreased appetite (1.3%), and pneumonitis (1%).

     HNSCC  



 Among the 192 patients with HNSCC enrolled in Study KEYNOTE-012, the median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA was 3.3 months (range: 1 day to 27.9 months). Patients with autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible for KEYNOTE-012. The median age of patients was 60 years (range: 20 to 84), 35% were age 65 years or older, 83% were male, 77% were White, 15% were Asian, and 5% were Black. Sixty-one percent of patients had two or more lines of therapy in the recurrent or metastatic setting, and 95% had prior radiation therapy. Baseline ECOG PS was 0 (30%) or 1 (70%) and 86% had M1 disease.



 KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 17% of patients. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 45% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients were pneumonia, dyspnea, confusional state, vomiting, pleural effusion, and respiratory failure. The incidence of adverse reactions, including serious adverse reactions, was similar between dosage regimens (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 200 mg every 3 weeks); these data were pooled. The most common adverse reactions (occurring in &gt;=20% of patients) were fatigue, decreased appetite, and dyspnea. Adverse reactions occurring in patients with HNSCC were generally similar to those occurring in patients with melanoma or NSCLC, with the exception of increased incidences of facial edema (10% all Grades; 2.1% Grades 3-4) and new or worsening hypothyroidism  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.4)  ]  .



     cHL  



 Among the 210 patients with cHL enrolled in Study KEYNOTE-087  [see  Clinical Studies (14.4)  ]  , the median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA was 8.4 months (range: 1 day to 15.2 months). KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 5% of patients, and treatment was interrupted due to adverse reactions in 26%. Fifteen percent (15%) of patients had an adverse reaction requiring systemic corticosteroid therapy. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 16% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions (&gt;=1%) included pneumonia, pneumonitis, pyrexia, dyspnea, graft versus host disease and herpes zoster. Two patients died from causes other than disease progression; one from GVHD after subsequent allogeneic HSCT and one from septic shock.

     PMBCL  



 Among the 53 patients with PMBCL treated in KEYNOTE-170  [see  Clinical Studies (14.5)  ],  the median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA was 3.5 months (range: 1 day to 22.8 months). KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 8% of patients, and treatment was interrupted due to adverse reactions in 15%. Twenty-five percent of patients had an adverse reaction requiring systemic corticosteroid therapy. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 26% of patients, and included arrhythmia (4%), cardiac tamponade (2%), myocardial infarction (2%), pericardial effusion (2%), and pericarditis (2%). Six (11%) patients died within 30 days of start of treatment.

     Cisplatin Ineligible Patients with Urothelial Carcinoma  



 The safety of KEYTRUDA was investigated in Study KEYNOTE-052, a single-arm trial that enrolled 370 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who were not eligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy. Patients with autoimmune disease or medical conditions that required systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications were ineligible. Patients received KEYTRUDA 200 mg every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or either radiographic or clinical disease progression. The median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA was 2.8 months (range: 1 day to 15.8 months).



 The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) were fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, decreased appetite, constipation, rash and diarrhea. KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 11% of patients. Eighteen patients (5%) died from causes other than disease progression. Five patients (1.4%) who were treated with KEYTRUDA experienced sepsis which led to death, and three patients (0.8%) experienced pneumonia which led to death. Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 22% of patients; the most common (&gt;=1%) were liver enzyme increase, diarrhea, urinary tract infection, acute kidney injury, fatigue, joint pain, and pneumonia. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 42% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions (&gt;=2%) were urinary tract infection, hematuria, acute kidney injury, pneumonia, and urosepsis.



 Immune-related adverse reactions that required systemic glucocorticoids occurred in 8% of patients, use of hormonal supplementation due to an immune-related adverse reaction occurred in 8% of patients, and 5% of patients required at least one steroid dose &gt;=40 mg oral prednisone equivalent.



 Table 14 summarizes the incidence of adverse reactions occurring in at least 10% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA.

             Previously Treated Urothelial Carcinoma  
 

 The safety of KEYTRUDA for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma with disease progression following platinum-containing chemotherapy was investigated in Study KEYNOTE-045. KEYNOTE-045 was a multicenter, open-label, randomized (1:1), active-controlled trial in which 266 patients received KEYTRUDA 200 mg every 3 weeks or investigator's choice of chemotherapy (n=255), consisting of paclitaxel (n=84), docetaxel (n=84) or vinflunine (n=87)  [see  Clinical Studies (14.6)  ]  . Patients with autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications were ineligible. The median duration of exposure was 3.5 months (range: 1 day to 20 months) in patients who received KEYTRUDA and 1.5 months (range: 1 day to 14 months) in patients who received chemotherapy.



 KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 8% of patients. The most common adverse reaction resulting in permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA was pneumonitis (1.9%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 20% of patients; the most common (&gt;=1%) were urinary tract infection (1.5%), diarrhea (1.5%), and colitis (1.1%). The most common adverse reactions (occurring in at least 20% of patients who received KEYTRUDA) were fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, pruritus, decreased appetite, nausea and rash. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 39% of KEYTRUDA-treated patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions (&gt;=2%) in KEYTRUDA-treated patients were urinary tract infection, pneumonia, anemia, and pneumonitis.



 Table 15 summarizes the incidence of adverse reactions occurring in at least 10% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Table 16 summarizes the incidence of laboratory abnormalities that occurred in at least 20% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA.

 Among the 259 patients with gastric cancer enrolled in Study KEYNOTE-059, the median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA was 2.1 months (range: 1 day to 21.4 months). Patients with autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression or with clinical evidence of ascites by physical exam were ineligible.



 Adverse reactions occurring in patients with gastric cancer were similar to those occurring in patients with melanoma or NSCLC.



     Cervical Cancer  



 Among the 98 patients with cervical cancer enrolled in Cohort E of Study KEYNOTE-158, the median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA was 2.9 months (range: 1 day to 22.1 months). Patients with autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible.



 KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 8% of patients. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 39% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported included anemia (7%), fistula (4.1%), hemorrhage (4.1%), and infections [except UTIs] (4.1%).

         Other laboratory abnormalities occurring in &gt;=10% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA were hypophosphatemia (19% all Grades; 6% Grades 3-4), INR increased (19% all Grades; 0% Grades 3-4), hypercalcemia (14% all Grades; 2.6% Grades 3-4), platelet count decreased (14% all Grades; 1.3% Grades 3-4), activated partial thromboplastin time prolonged (14% all Grades; 0% Grades 3-4), hypoglycemia (13% all Grades; 1.3% Grades 3-4), white blood cell decreased (13% all Grades; 2.6% Grades 3-4), and hyperkalemia (13% all Grades; 1.3% Grades 3-4).
 

     HCC  



 Among the 104 patients with HCC who received KEYTRUDA in Study KEYNOTE-224, the median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA was 4.2 months (range: 1 day to 1.5 years). Adverse reactions occurring in patients with HCC were generally similar to those in patients with melanoma or NSCLC, with the exception of increased incidences of ascites (8% Grades 3-4) and immune-mediated hepatitis (2.9%). Laboratory abnormalities (Grades 3-4) that occurred at a higher incidence were elevated AST (20%), ALT (9%), and hyperbilirubinemia (10%).



   6.2 Immunogenicity

  As with all therapeutic proteins, there is the potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of incidence of antibodies to pembrolizumab in the studies described below with the incidences of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading.



 Trough levels of pembrolizumab interfere with the electrochemiluminescent (ECL) assay results; therefore, a subset analysis was performed in the patients with a concentration of pembrolizumab below the drug tolerance level of the anti-product antibody assay. In clinical studies in patients treated with pembrolizumab at a dose of 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks, 200 mg every 3 weeks, or 10 mg/kg every 2 or 3 weeks, 27 (2.1%) of 1289 evaluable patients tested positive for treatment-emergent anti-pembrolizumab antibodies of whom six (0.5%) patients had neutralizing antibodies against pembrolizumab. There was no evidence of an altered pharmacokinetic profile or increased infusion reactions with anti-pembrolizumab binding antibody development.

   5.1 Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis



  KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate patients with suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging and administer corticosteroids (initial dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent followed by a taper) for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for moderate (Grade 2) pneumonitis, and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for severe (Grade 3), life-threatening (Grade 4), or recurrent moderate (Grade 2) pneumonitis [see  Dosage and Administration (2.12)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  



 Pneumonitis occurred in 94 (3.4%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), Grade 2 (1.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 5 (0.1%) pneumonitis. The median time to onset was 3.3 months (range: 2 days to 19.3 months), and the median duration was 1.5 months (range: 1 day to 17.2+ months). Sixty-three (67%) of the 94 patients received systemic corticosteroids, with 50 of the 63 receiving high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 8 days (range: 1 day to 10.1 months) followed by a corticosteroid taper. Pneumonitis occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (6.9%) than in patients who did not receive prior thoracic radiation (2.9%). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 36 (1.3%) patients. Pneumonitis resolved in 55 (59%) of the 94 patients.



    5.2 Immune-Mediated Colitis



  KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids (initial dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent followed by a taper) for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for moderate (Grade 2) or severe (Grade 3) colitis, and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for life-threatening (Grade 4) colitis [see  Dosage and Administration (2.12)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  



 Colitis occurred in 48 (1.7%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%) colitis. The median time to onset was 3.5 months (range: 10 days to 16.2 months), and the median duration was 1.3 months (range: 1 day to 8.7+ months). Thirty-three (69%) of the 48 patients received systemic corticosteroids, with 27 of the 33 requiring high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 7 days (range: 1 day to 5.3 months) followed by a corticosteroid taper. Colitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 15 (0.5%) patients. Colitis resolved in 41 (85%) of the 48 patients.



    5.3 Immune-Mediated Hepatitis



  KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids (initial dose of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day [for Grade 2 hepatitis] and 1 to 2 mg/kg/day [for Grade 3 or greater hepatitis] prednisone or equivalent followed by a taper) and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA [see  Dosage and Administration (2.12)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  



 Hepatitis occurred in 19 (0.7%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%) hepatitis. The median time to onset was 1.3 months (range: 8 days to 21.4 months), and the median duration was 1.8 months (range: 8 days to 20.9+ months). Thirteen (68%) of the 19 patients received systemic corticosteroids, with 12 of the 13 receiving high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 5 days (range: 1 to 26 days) followed by a corticosteroid taper. Hepatitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 6 (0.2%) patients. Hepatitis resolved in 15 (79%) of the 19 patients.



    5.4 Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies



   Hypophysitis  



 KEYTRUDA can cause hypophysitis. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency). Administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for moderate (Grade 2) hypophysitis and withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) hypophysitis [see  Dosage and Administration (2.12)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  



 Hypophysitis occurred in 17 (0.6%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.2%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%) hypophysitis. The median time to onset was 3.7 months (range: 1 day to 11.9 months), and the median duration was 4.7 months (range: 8+ days to 12.7+ months). Sixteen (94%) of the 17 patients received systemic corticosteroids, with 6 of the 16 receiving high-dose corticosteroids. Hypophysitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 4 (0.1%) patients. Hypophysitis resolved in 7 (41%) of the 17 patients.



    Thyroid Disorders  



 KEYTRUDA can cause thyroid disorders, including hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism and thyroiditis. Monitor patients for changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders. Administer replacement hormones for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) hyperthyroidism [see  Dosage and Administration (2.12)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  



 Hyperthyroidism occurred in 96 (3.4%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and Grade 3 (0.1%) hyperthyroidism. The median time to onset was 1.4 months (range: 1 day to 21.9 months), and the median duration was 2.1 months (range: 3 days to 15.0+ months). Hyperthyroidism led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 2 (&lt;0.1%) patients. Hyperthyroidism resolved in 71 (74%) of the 96 patients.



 Hypothyroidism occurred in 237 (8.5%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and Grade 3 (0.1%) hypothyroidism. The median time to onset was 3.5 months (range: 1 day to 18.9 months), and the median duration was not reached (range: 2 days to 27.7+ months). Hypothyroidism led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1 (&lt;0.1%) patient. Hypothyroidism resolved in 48 (20%) of the 237 patients. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in patients with HNSCC occurring in 28 (15%) of 192 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.5%) hypothyroidism. Of these 28 patients, 15 had no prior history of hypothyroidism.



 Thyroiditis occurred in 16 (0.6%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.3%) thyroiditis. The median time of onset was 1.2 months (range: 0.5 to 3.5 months).



    Type 1 Diabetes mellitus  



 KEYTRUDA can cause type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, which have been reported in 6 (0.2%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer anti-hyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia [see  Dosage and Administration (2.12)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



    5.5 Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction



  KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids (initial dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent followed by a taper) for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for moderate (Grade 2), and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) nephritis [see  Dosage and Administration (2.12)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  



  Nephritis occurred in 9 (0.3%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), Grade 3 (0.1%), and Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%) nephritis. The median time to onset was 5.1 months (range: 12 days to 12.8 months), and the median duration was 3.3 months (range: 12 days to 8.9+ months). Eight (89%) of the 9 patients received systemic corticosteroids, with 7 of the 8 receiving high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 15 days (range: 3 days to 4.0 months) followed by a corticosteroid taper. Nephritis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 3 (0.1%) patients. Nephritis resolved in 5 (56%) of the 9 patients. Nephritis occurred in 1.7% of 405 patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum in the KEYNOTE-189 study, including Grade 3 (1%) and Grade 4 (0.5%) nephritis. The median time to onset was 3.2 months (range: 16 days to 11.1 months) and the duration ranged from 1.6 to 16.8+ months. Six (86%) of the 7 patients received systemic corticosteroids, with all 6 receiving high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 3 days (range: 1 to 17 days) followed by a corticosteroid taper. Nephritis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5 (1.2%) patients. Nephritis resolved in 2 (29%) of the 7 patients.  



    5.6 Immune-Mediated Skin Adverse Reactions



  Immune-mediated rashes, including SJS, TEN (some cases with fatal outcome), exfoliative dermatitis, and bullous pemphigoid, can occur. Monitor patients for suspected severe skin reactions and exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. For signs or symptoms of SJS or TEN, withhold KEYTRUDA and refer the patient for specialized care for assessment and treatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA. [See  Dosage and Administration (2.12)  .]  



    5.7 Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions



   Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue in patients receiving KEYTRUDA. While immune-mediated adverse reactions usually occur during treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies, they may occur after discontinuation of treatment.  



 For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the immune-mediated adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction [see  Dosage and Administration (2.12)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  



  The following clinically significant, immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients treated with KEYTRUDA: arthritis (1.5%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis, and encephalitis. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including cHL, and post-marketing use.  



 Solid organ transplant rejection has been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients treated with KEYTRUDA. Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment with KEYTRUDA versus the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients.



    5.8 Infusion-Related Reactions



  KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 6 (0.2%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions including rigors, chills, wheezing, pruritus, flushing, rash, hypotension, hypoxemia, and fever. For severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) infusion-related reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA [see  Dosage and Administration (2.12)  ]  .



    5.9 Complications of Allogeneic HSCT



   Allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA  



 Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) after being treated with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA on any trial, 6 patients (26%) developed graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), one of which was fatal, and 2 patients (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning, one of which was fatal. Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor blocking antibody before transplantation. These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute GVHD, severe (Grade 3 to 4) acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic VOD, and other immune-mediated adverse reactions, and intervene promptly.



     Allogeneic HSCT prior to treatment with KEYTRUDA    



  In patients with a history of allogeneic HSCT, acute GVHD, including fatal GVHD, has been reported after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Patients who experienced GVHD after their transplant procedure may be at increased risk for GVHD after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Consider the benefit of treatment with KEYTRUDA versus the risk of possible GVHD in patients with a history of allogeneic HSCT.  



    5.10 Increased Mortality in Patients with Multiple Myeloma when KEYTRUDA is Added to a Thalidomide Analogue and Dexamethasone



   In two randomized clinical trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone, a use for which no PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody is indicated, resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of patients with multiple myeloma with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials.  



    5.11 Embryofetal Toxicity



  Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Animal models link the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway with maintenance of pregnancy through induction of maternal immune tolerance to fetal tissue. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment with KEYTRUDA and for 4 months after the last dose of KEYTRUDA [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1  ,  8.3)  ].
