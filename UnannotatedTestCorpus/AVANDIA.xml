  6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

    Adult:  In clinical trials, approximately 9,900 patients with type 2 diabetes have been treated with AVANDIA.



   Short-Term Trials of AVANDIA as    Monotherapy    and in Combination    With    Other Hypoglycemic Agents:  The incidence and types of adverse events reported in short-term clinical trials of AVANDIA as monotherapy are shown in Table 6.

 Overall, the types of adverse reactions without regard to causality reported when AVANDIA was used in combination with a sulfonylurea or metformin were similar to those during monotherapy with AVANDIA.



 Events of anemia and edema tended to be reported more frequently at higher doses, and were generally mild to moderate in severity and usually did not require discontinuation of treatment with AVANDIA.



 In double-blind trials, anemia was reported in 1.9% of patients receiving AVANDIA as monotherapy compared to 0.7% on placebo, 0.6% on sulfonylureas, and 2.2% on metformin. Reports of anemia were greater in patients treated with a combination of AVANDIA and metformin (7.1%) and with a combination of AVANDIA and a sulfonylurea plus metformin (6.7%) compared to monotherapy with AVANDIA or in combination with a sulfonylurea (2.3%). Lower pre-treatment hemoglobin/hematocrit levels in patients enrolled in the metformin combination clinical trials may have contributed to the higher reporting rate of anemia in these trials  [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]  .



 In clinical trials, edema was reported in 4.8% of patients receiving AVANDIA as monotherapy compared to 1.3% on placebo, 1.0% on sulfonylureas, and 2.2% on metformin. The reporting rate of edema was higher for AVANDIA 8 mg in sulfonylurea combinations (12.4%) compared to other combinations, with the exception of insulin. Edema was reported in 14.7% of patients receiving AVANDIA in the insulin combination trials compared to 5.4% on insulin alone. Reports of new onset or exacerbation of congestive heart failure occurred at rates of 1% for insulin alone, and 2% (4 mg) and 3% (8 mg) for insulin in combination with AVANDIA  [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]  . The use of AVANDIA in combination with insulin may increase the risk of myocardial infarction  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].  



 In controlled combination therapy trials with sulfonylureas, mild to moderate hypoglycemic symptoms, which appear to be dose related, were reported. Few patients were withdrawn for hypoglycemia (&lt;1%) and few episodes of hypoglycemia were considered to be severe (&lt;1%). Hypoglycemia was the most frequently reported adverse event in the fixed-dose insulin combination trials, although few patients withdrew for hypoglycemia (4 of 408 for AVANDIA plus insulin and 1 of 203 for insulin alone). Rates of hypoglycemia, confirmed by capillary blood glucose concentration &lt;=50 mg/dL, were 6% for insulin alone and 12% (4 mg) and 14% (8 mg) for insulin in combination with AVANDIA.  [See Warnings and Precautions (5.9).]  



   Long-Term Trial of AVANDIA as    Monotherapy    :  A 4- to 6-year trial (ADOPT) compared the use of AVANDIA (n = 1,456), glyburide (n = 1,441), and metformin (n = 1,454) as monotherapy in patients recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes who were not previously treated with antidiabetic medication. Table 7 presents adverse reactions without regard to causality; rates are expressed per 100 patient-years (PY) exposure to account for the differences in exposure to trial medication across the 3 treatment groups.



 In ADOPT, fractures were reported in a greater number of women treated with AVANDIA (9.3%, 2.7/100 patient-years) compared to glyburide (3.5%, 1.3/100 patient-years) or metformin (5.1%, 1.5/100 patient-years). The majority of the fractures in the women who received rosiglitazone were reported in the upper arm, hand, and foot.  [See Warnings and Precautions (5.7).]  The observed incidence of fractures for male patients was similar among the 3 treatment groups.

            Pediatric:  AVANDIA has been evaluated for safety in a single, active-controlled trial of pediatric patients with type 2 diabetes in which 99 were treated with AVANDIA and 101 were treated with metformin. The most common adverse reactions (&gt;10%) without regard to causality for either AVANDIA or metformin were headache (17% versus 14%), nausea (4% versus 11%), nasopharyngitis (3% versus 12%), and diarrhea (1% versus 13%). In this trial, one case of diabetic ketoacidosis was reported in the metformin group. In addition, there were 3 patients in the rosiglitazone group who had FPG of ∼300 mg/dL, 2+ ketonuria, and an elevated anion gap.
 

   6.2 Laboratory Abnormalities

    Hematologic:  Decreases in mean hemoglobin and hematocrit occurred in a dose-related fashion in adult patients treated with AVANDIA (mean decreases in individual trials as much as 1.0 g/dL hemoglobin and as much as 3.3% hematocrit). The changes occurred primarily during the first 3 months following initiation of therapy with AVANDIA or following a dose increase in AVANDIA. The time course and magnitude of decreases were similar in patients treated with a combination of AVANDIA and other hypoglycemic agents or monotherapy with AVANDIA. Pre-treatment levels of hemoglobin and hematocrit were lower in patients in metformin combination trials and may have contributed to the higher reporting rate of anemia. In a single trial in pediatric patients, decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit (mean decreases of 0.29 g/dL and 0.95%, respectively) were reported. Small decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit have also been reported in pediatric patients treated with AVANDIA. White blood cell counts also decreased slightly in adult patients treated with AVANDIA. Decreases in hematologic parameters may be related to increased plasma volume observed with treatment with AVANDIA.



   Lipids:  Changes in serum lipids have been observed following treatment with AVANDIA in adults  [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]  . Small changes in serum lipid parameters were reported in children treated with AVANDIA for 24 weeks.



   Serum    Transaminase    Levels:  In pre-approval clinical trials in 4,598 patients treated with AVANDIA (3,600 patient-years of exposure) and in a long-term 4- to 6-year trial in 1,456 patients treated with AVANDIA (4,954 patient-years exposure), there was no evidence of drug-induced hepatotoxicity.



 In pre-approval controlled trials, 0.2% of patients treated with AVANDIA had elevations in ALT &gt;3X the upper limit of normal compared to 0.2% on placebo and 0.5% on active comparators. The ALT elevations in patients treated with AVANDIA were reversible. Hyperbilirubinemia was found in 0.3% of patients treated with AVANDIA compared with 0.9% treated with placebo and 1% in patients treated with active comparators. In pre-approval clinical trials, there were no cases of idiosyncratic drug reactions leading to hepatic failure.  [See Warnings and Precautions (5.5).]  



 In the 4- to 6-year ADOPT trial, patients treated with AVANDIA (4,954 patient-years exposure), glyburide (4,244 patient-years exposure), or metformin (4,906 patient-years exposure), as monotherapy, had the same rate of ALT increase to &gt;3X upper limit of normal (0.3 per 100 patient-years exposure).



   6.3 Postmarketing Experience

  In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the events described below have been identified during post-approval use of AVANDIA. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to always establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 In patients receiving thiazolidinedione therapy, serious adverse events with or without a fatal outcome, potentially related to volume expansion (e.g., congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, and pleural effusions) have been reported  [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]  .



 There are postmarketing reports with AVANDIA of hepatitis, hepatic enzyme elevations to 3 or more times the upper limit of normal, and hepatic failure with and without fatal outcome, although causality has not been established.



 There are postmarketing reports with AVANDIA of rash, pruritus, urticaria, angioedema, anaphylactic reaction, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and new onset or worsening diabetic macular edema with decreased visual acuity  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]  .

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE AND MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION

  WARNING: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE AND MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION

    *  Thiazolidinediones, including rosiglitazone, cause or exacerbate congestive heart failure in some patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. After initiation of AVANDIA, and after dose increases, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of heart failure (including excessive, rapid weight gain, dyspnea, and/or edema). If these signs and symptoms develop, the heart failure should be managed according to current standards of care. Furthermore, discontinuation or dose reduction of AVANDIA must be considered. 
 *  AVANDIA is not recommended in patients with symptomatic heart failure. Initiation of AVANDIA in patients with established NYHA Class III or IV heart failure is contraindicated. [See Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1).] 
 *  A meta-analysis of 52 clinical trials (mean duration 6 months; 16,995 total patients), most of which compared AVANDIA to placebo, showed AVANDIA to be associated with a statistically significant increased risk of myocardial infarction. Three other trials (mean duration 46 months; 14,067 total patients), comparing AVANDIA to some other approved oral antidiabetic agents or placebo, showed a statistically non-significant increased risk of myocardial infarction, and a statistically non-significant decreased risk of death. There have been no clinical trials directly comparing cardiovascular risk of AVANDIA and ACTOS(r) (pioglitazone, another thiazolidinedione), but in a separate trial, pioglitazone (when compared to placebo) did not show an increased risk of myocardial infarction or death. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.2).]

   5.1 Cardiac Failure



  AVANDIA, like other thiazolidinediones, alone or in combination with other antidiabetic agents, can cause fluid retention, which may exacerbate or lead to heart failure. Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If these signs and symptoms develop, the heart failure should be managed according to current standards of care. Furthermore, discontinuation or dose reduction of rosiglitazone must be considered [see Boxed Warning]  .



 Patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) NYHA Class I and II treated with AVANDIA have an increased risk of cardiovascular events. A 52-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled echocardiographic trial was conducted in 224 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and NYHA Class I or II CHF (ejection fraction &lt;=45%) on background antidiabetic and CHF therapy. An independent committee conducted a blinded evaluation of fluid-related events (including congestive heart failure) and cardiovascular hospitalizations according to predefined criteria (adjudication). Separate from the adjudication, other cardiovascular adverse events were reported by investigators. Although no treatment difference in change from baseline of ejection fractions was observed, more cardiovascular adverse events were observed following treatment with AVANDIA compared to placebo during the 52-week trial. (See Table 1.)

 Initiation of AVANDIA in patients with established NYHA Class III or IV heart failure is contraindicated. AVANDIA is not recommended in patients with symptomatic heart failure. [See Boxed Warning.]  



 Patients experiencing acute coronary syndromes have not been studied in controlled clinical trials. In view of the potential for development of heart failure in patients having an acute coronary event, initiation of AVANDIA is not recommended for patients experiencing an acute coronary event, and discontinuation of AVANDIA during this acute phase should be considered.



 Patients with NYHA Class III and IV cardiac status (with or without CHF) have not been studied in controlled clinical trials. AVANDIA is not recommended in patients with NYHA Class III and IV cardiac status.



  Congestive Heart Failure   During      Coadministration   of AVANDIA With Insulin:  In trials in which AVANDIA was added to insulin, AVANDIA increased the risk of congestive heart failure. Coadministration of AVANDIA and insulin is not recommended. [See Indications and Usage (1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2).]  



  In 7 controlled, randomized, double-blind trials which had durations from 16 to 26 weeks and which were included in a meta-analysis  1   [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]  , patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomized to   coadministration   of AVANDIA and insulin (N = 1,018) or insulin (N = 815). In these 7 trials, AVANDIA was added to insulin. These trials included patients with long-standing diabetes (median duration of 12 years) and a high prevalence of pre-existing medical conditions, including peripheral neuropathy, retinopathy, ischemic heart disease, vascular disease, and congestive heart failure. The total number of patients with emergent congestive heart failure was 23 (2.3%) and 8 (1.0%) in the AVANDIA plus insulin and insulin groups, respectively.  



   Heart Failure in Observational Studies of Elderly Diabetic Patients Comparing AVANDIA to ACTOS:  Three observational studies  2-4  in elderly diabetic patients (age 65 years and older) found that AVANDIA statistically significantly increased the risk of hospitalized heart failure compared to use of ACTOS. One other observational study  5  in patients with a mean age of 54 years, which also included an analysis in a subpopulation of patients &gt;65 years of age, found no statistically significant increase in emergency department visits or hospitalization for heart failure in patients treated with AVANDIA compared to ACTOS in the older subgroup.  



    5.2 Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events



   Cardiovascular adverse events have been evaluated in a meta-analysis of 52 clinical trials, in long-term, prospective, randomized, controlled trials, and in observational studies.  



   Meta-Analysis of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events in a Group of 52 Clinical Trials:  A meta-analysis was conducted retrospectively to assess cardiovascular adverse events reported across 52 double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trials (mean duration 6 months).  1  These trials had been conducted to assess glucose-lowering efficacy in type 2 diabetes. Prospectively planned adjudication of cardiovascular events did not occur in most of the trials. Some trials were placebo-controlled and some used active oral   antidiabetic   drugs as controls. Placebo-controlled trials included   monotherapy   trials (   monotherapy   with AVANDIA versus placebo   monotherapy   ) and add-on trials (AVANDIA or placebo, added to sulfonylurea,   metformin   , or insulin). Active control trials included   monotherapy   trials (   monotherapy   with AVANDIA versus sulfonylurea or   metformin      monotherapy   ) and add-on trials (AVANDIA plus sulfonylurea or AVANDIA plus   metformin   , versus sulfonylurea plus   metformin   ). A total of 16,995 patients were included (10,039 in treatment groups containing AVANDIA, 6,956 in comparator groups), with 5,167 patient-years of exposure to AVANDIA and 3,637 patient-years of exposure to comparator. Cardiovascular events occurred more frequently for patients who received AVANDIA than for patients who received comparators (see Table 2).

  In this analysis, a statistically significant increased risk of myocardial infarction with AVANDIA versus pooled comparators was observed. Analyses were performed using a composite of major adverse cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death), referred to hereafter as MACE. AVANDIA had a statistically non-significant increased risk of MACE compared to the pooled comparators. A statistically significant increased risk of myocardial infarction and statistically non-significant increased risk of MACE with AVANDIA was observed in the placebo-controlled trials. In the active-controlled trials, there was no increased risk of myocardial infarction or MACE.   (See Figure 1 and Table 3.)

  Of the placebo-controlled trials in the meta-analysis, 7 trials had patients randomized to AVANDIA plus insulin or insulin. There were more patients in the AVANDIA plus insulin group compared to the insulin group with myocardial infarctions, MACE, cardiovascular deaths, and all-cause deaths (see Table 4). The total number of patients with stroke was 5 (0.5%) and 4 (0.5%) in the AVANDIA plus insulin and insulin groups, respectively. The use of AVANDIA in combination with insulin may increase the risk of myocardial infarction.

    a     Events are not exclusive: i.e., a patient with a cardiovascular death due to a myocardial infarction would be counted in 4 event categories (myocardial infarction; myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death, or stroke; cardiovascular death; all-cause death).  



   Myocardial Infarction Events in Large, Long-Term, Prospective, Randomized, Controlled Trials of AVANDIA:  Data from 3 large, long-term, prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trials of AVANDIA were assessed separately from the meta-analysis.  6-8  These 3 trials included a total of 14,067 patients (treatment groups containing AVANDIA N = 6,311; comparator groups N = 7,756), with patient-year exposure of 24,534 patient-years for AVANDIA and 28,882 patient-years for comparator. Patient populations in the trials included patients with impaired glucose tolerance, patients with type 2 diabetes who were initiating oral agent   monotherapy   , and patients with type   2 diabetes who had failed   monotherapy   and were initiating dual oral agent therapy   . Duration of follow-up exceeded 3 years in each trial.  



  In each of these trials, there was a statistically non-significant increase in the risk of myocardial infarction for AVANDIA versus comparator medications.  



  In a long-term, randomized, placebo-controlled, 2x2 factorial trial intended to evaluate AVANDIA, and separately   ramipril   (an   angiotensin   converting enzyme inhibitor [ACEI]), on progression to overt diabetes in 5,269 subjects with glucose intolerance, the incidence of myocardial infarction was higher in the subset of subjects who received AVANDIA in combination with   ramipril   than among subjects who received   ramipril   alone but not in the subset of subjects who received AVANDIA alone compared to placebo.  6  The higher incidence of myocardial infarction among subjects who received AVANDIA in combination with   ramipril   was not confirmed in the two other large (total N = 8,798) long-term, randomized, active-controlled clinical trials conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes, in which 30% and 40% of patients in the two trials reported   angiotensin   -converting enzyme inhibitor use at baseline.  7,8    



  There have been no adequately designed clinical trials directly comparing AVANDIA to ACTOS (   pioglitazone   ) on cardiovascular risks. However, in a long-term, randomized, placebo-controlled cardiovascular outcomes trial comparing ACTOS (   pioglitazone   ) to placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and prior   macrovascular   disease, ACTOS (   pioglitazone   ) was not associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction or total mortality.  9    



  The increased risk of myocardial infarction observed in the meta-analysis and large, long-term controlled clinical trials, and the increased risk of MACE observed in the meta-analysis described above, have not translated into a consistent finding of excess mortality from controlled clinical trials or observational studies. Clinical trials have not shown any difference between AVANDIA and comparator medications in overall mortality or CV-related mortality.  



   Mortality in Observational Studies of AVANDIA Compared to ACTOS:  Three observational studies in elderly diabetic patients (age 65 years and older) found that AVANDIA statistically significantly increased the risk of all-cause mortality compared to use of ACTOS.  2-4  One observational study  5  in patients with a mean age of 54 years found no difference in all-cause mortality between patients treated with AVANDIA compared to ACTOS and reported similar results in the subpopulation of patients &gt;65 years of age. One additional small, prospective, observational study  10  found no statistically significant differences for CV mortality and all-cause mortality in patients treated with AVANDIA compared to ACTOS.  



  Figure 1. Forest Plot of Odds Ratios (95% Confidence Intervals) for MACE and Myocardial Infarction in the Meta-Analysis of 52 Clinical Trials    5.3 Edema



  AVANDIA should be used with caution in patients with edema. In a clinical trial in healthy volunteers who received 8 mg of AVANDIA once daily for 8 weeks, there was a statistically significant increase in median plasma volume compared to placebo.



 Since thiazolidinediones, including rosiglitazone, can cause fluid retention, which can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure, AVANDIA should be used with caution in patients at risk for heart failure. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of heart failure [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Patient Counseling Information (17)]  .



 In controlled clinical trials of patients with type 2 diabetes, mild to moderate edema was reported in patients treated with AVANDIA, and may be dose related. Patients with ongoing edema were more likely to have adverse events associated with edema if started on combination therapy with insulin and AVANDIA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]  .



    5.4 Weight Gain



  Dose-related weight gain was seen with AVANDIA alone and in combination with other hypoglycemic agents (Table 5). The mechanism of weight gain is unclear but probably involves a combination of fluid retention and fat accumulation.



 In postmarketing experience, there have been reports of unusually rapid increases in weight and increases in excess of that generally observed in clinical trials. Patients who experience such increases should be assessed for fluid accumulation and volume-related events such as excessive edema and congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning]  .

            In a 4- to 6-year, monotherapy, comparative trial (ADOPT) in patients recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes not previously treated with antidiabetic medication [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]  , the median weight change (25  th  , 75  th  percentiles) from baseline at 4 years was 3.5 kg (0.0, 8.1) for AVANDIA, 2.0 kg (-1.0, 4.8) for glyburide, and -2.4 kg (-5.4, 0.5) for metformin.
 

 In a 24-week trial in pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years treated with AVANDIA 4 to 8 mg daily, a median weight gain of 2.8 kg (25  th  , 75  th  percentiles: 0.0, 5.8) was reported.



    5.5 Hepatic Effects



  Liver enzymes should be measured prior to the initiation of therapy with AVANDIA in all patients and periodically thereafter per the clinical judgment of the healthcare professional. Therapy with AVANDIA should not be initiated in patients with increased baseline liver enzyme levels (ALT &gt;2.5X upper limit of normal). Patients with mildly elevated liver enzymes (ALT levels &lt;=2.5X upper limit of normal) at baseline or during therapy with AVANDIA should be evaluated to determine the cause of the liver enzyme elevation. Initiation of, or continuation of, therapy with AVANDIA in patients with mild liver enzyme elevations should proceed with caution and include close clinical follow-up, including liver enzyme monitoring, to determine if the liver enzyme elevations resolve or worsen. If at any time ALT levels increase to &gt;3X the upper limit of normal in patients on therapy with AVANDIA, liver enzyme levels should be rechecked as soon as possible. If ALT levels remain &gt;3X the upper limit of normal, therapy with AVANDIA should be discontinued.



 If any patient develops symptoms suggesting hepatic dysfunction, which may include unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia and/or dark urine, liver enzymes should be checked. The decision whether to continue the patient on therapy with AVANDIA should be guided by clinical judgment pending laboratory evaluations. If jaundice is observed, drug therapy should be discontinued. [See Adverse Reactions (6.2, 6.3).]  



    5.6 Macular Edema



  Macular edema has been reported in postmarketing experience in some diabetic patients who were taking AVANDIA or another thiazolidinedione. Some patients presented with blurred vision or decreased visual acuity, but some patients appear to have been diagnosed on routine ophthalmologic examination. Most patients had peripheral edema at the time macular edema was diagnosed. Some patients had improvement in their macular edema after discontinuation of their thiazolidinedione. Patients with diabetes should have regular eye exams by an ophthalmologist, per the Standards of Care of the American Diabetes Association. Additionally, any diabetic who reports any kind of visual symptom should be promptly referred to an ophthalmologist, regardless of the patient's underlying medications or other physical findings. [See Adverse Reactions (6.1).]  



    5.7 Fractures



  In a 4- to 6-year comparative trial (ADOPT) of glycemic control with monotherapy in drug-naive patients recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus, an increased incidence of bone fracture was noted in female patients taking AVANDIA. Over the 4- to 6-year period, the incidence of bone fracture in females was 9.3% (60/645) for AVANDIA versus 3.5% (21/605) for glyburide and 5.1% (30/590) for metformin. This increased incidence was noted after the first year of treatment and persisted during the course of the trial. The majority of the fractures in the women who received AVANDIA occurred in the upper arm, hand, and foot. These sites of fracture are different from those usually associated with postmenopausal osteoporosis (e.g., hip or spine). Other trials suggest that this risk may also apply to men, although the risk of fracture among women appears higher than that among men.  The risk of fracture should be considered in the care of patients treated with AVANDIA, and attention given to assessing and maintaining bone health according to current standards of care.



    5.8 Hematologic Effects



  Decreases in mean hemoglobin and hematocrit occurred in a dose-related fashion in adult patients treated with AVANDIA [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]  . The observed changes may be related to the increased plasma volume observed with treatment with AVANDIA.



    5.9 Diabetes and Blood Glucose Control



  Patients receiving AVANDIA in combination with other hypoglycemic agents may be at risk for hypoglycemia, and a reduction in the dose of the concomitant agent may be necessary.



 Periodic fasting blood glucose and HbA1c measurements should be performed to monitor therapeutic response.



    5.10 Ovulation



  Therapy with AVANDIA, like other thiazolidinediones, may result in ovulation in some premenopausal anovulatory women. As a result, these patients may be at an increased risk for pregnancy while taking AVANDIA [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]  . Thus, adequate contraception in premenopausal women should be recommended. This possible effect has not been specifically investigated in clinical trials; therefore, the frequency of this occurrence is not known.



 Although hormonal imbalance has been seen in preclinical studies [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]  , the clinical significance of this finding is not known. If unexpected menstrual dysfunction occurs, the benefits of continued therapy with AVANDIA should be reviewed.
