  The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling:



 *  Hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (  4.1  )]  
 *  Allergy [see Contraindications (  4.2  )]  
 *  Risk of Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )]  
   *  The most frequently reported adverse reactions (&gt;10% and greater than placebo) were headache, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea (  6.1  ) 
      EXCERPT:     To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at (800) 542-6257 or (800) 459-9906 TTY or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or    www.fda.gov/medwatch    .  
 

 

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The efficacy and safety of AGGRENOX was established in the European Stroke Prevention Study-2 (ESPS2). ESPS2 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study that evaluated 6602 patients over the age of 18 years who had a previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack within ninety days prior to entry. Patients were randomized to either AGGRENOX, aspirin, ER-DP, or placebo  [see Clinical Studies (  14  )]  ; primary endpoints included stroke (fatal or nonfatal) and death from all causes.



 This 24-month, multicenter, double-blind, randomized study (ESPS2) was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of AGGRENOX with placebo, extended-release dipyridamole alone and aspirin alone. The study was conducted in a total of 6602 male and female patients who had experienced a previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemia of the brain within three months prior to randomization.



 Table 1 presents the annualized event rate for adverse events that occurred in 1%/year or more of patients treated with AGGRENOX where the incidence was also at least 1%/year greater than in those patients treated with placebo. There is no clear benefit of the dipyridamole/aspirin combination over aspirin with respect to safety.

   6.2 Post-Marketing Experience

  The following is a list of additional adverse reactions that have been reported either in the literature or are from post-marketing spontaneous reports for either dipyridamole or aspirin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to AGGRENOX.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  AGGRENOX increases the risk of bleeding (  5.1  ) 
 *  Avoid use in patients with severe hepatic or renal insufficiency (  5.2  ,  5.3  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Risk of Bleeding



  AGGRENOX increases the risk of bleeding. Risk factors for bleeding include the use of other drugs that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, heparin, anagrelide, fibrinolytic therapy, and chronic use of NSAIDs) [see Drug Interactions (  7.1  )]  .



   Intracranial Hemorrhage    In European Stroke Prevention Study-2 (ESPS2), the annualized event rate for intracranial hemorrhage was 0.39%/year in the AGGRENOX group, 0.26%/year in the extended-release dipyridamole (ER-DP) group, 0.24%/year in the aspirin (ASA) group, and 0.29%/year in the placebo groups.
 

   Gastrointestinal (GI) Side Effects    GI side effects include stomach pain, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and gross GI bleeding. Although minor upper GI symptoms, such as dyspepsia, are common and can occur anytime during therapy, physicians should remain alert for signs of ulceration and bleeding, even in the absence of previous GI symptoms. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of GI side effects and what steps to take if they occur.
 

 In ESPS2, the annualized event rate for gastrointestinal bleeding was 2.97%/year in the AGGRENOX group, 1.58%/year in the extended-release dipyridamole group, 2.06%/year in the aspirin group, and 1.40%/year in the placebo groups.



   Peptic Ulcer Disease    Avoid using aspirin in patients with a history of active peptic ulcer disease, which can cause gastric mucosal irritation and bleeding.
 

   Alcohol Warning    Because AGGRENOX contains aspirin, counsel patients who consume three or more alcoholic drinks every day about the bleeding risks involved with chronic, heavy alcohol use while taking aspirin.
 

    5.2 Renal Failure



  Avoid aspirin in patients with severe renal failure (glomerular filtration rate less than 10 mL/minute) [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.6  ) and Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )]  .



    5.3 Hepatic Insufficiency



  Elevations of hepatic enzymes and hepatic failure have been reported in association with dipyridamole administration [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.6  ) and Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )]  .



    5.4 Coronary Artery Disease



  Dipyridamole has a vasodilatory effect. Chest pain may be precipitated or aggravated in patients with underlying coronary artery disease who are receiving dipyridamole.



 For stroke or TIA patients for whom aspirin is indicated to prevent recurrent myocardial infarction (MI) or angina pectoris, the aspirin in this product may not provide adequate treatment for the cardiac indications.



    5.5 Hypotension



  Dipyridamole produces peripheral vasodilation, which can exacerbate pre-existing hypotension.



    5.6 General



  AGGRENOX capsules are not interchangeable with the individual components of aspirin and dipyridamole tablets.
