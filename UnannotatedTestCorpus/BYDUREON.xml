  6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

 The safety of BYDUREON was assessed in six comparator-controlled trials in patients who entered the studies not achieving adequate glycemic control on their current therapy. In a double-blind 26-week trial, patients on diet and exercise were treated with BYDUREON 2 mg once every 7 days (weekly), sitagliptin 100 mg daily, pioglitazone 45 mg daily, or metformin 2000 mg daily. In a double-blind 26-week trial, patients on metformin were treated with BYDUREON 2 mg once every 7 days (weekly), sitagliptin 100 mg daily, or pioglitazone 45 mg daily. In an open-label 26-week trial, patients on metformin or metformin plus sulfonylurea were treated with BYDUREON 2 mg once every 7 days (weekly) or optimized insulin glargine. In two open-label 24- to 30-week studies, patients on diet and exercise or metformin, a sulfonylurea, a thiazolidinedione, or combination of oral agents were treated with BYDUREON 2 mg once every 7 days (weekly) or BYETTA 10 mcg twice daily. In an open-label 26-week trial, patients on metformin, a sulfonylurea, metformin plus a sulfonylurea, or metformin plus pioglitazone were treated with BYDUREON 2 mg every 7 days (weekly) or liraglutide 1.8 mg once daily.

     Common Adverse Reactions  

  Tables 1 and 2 summarize adverse reactions with an incidence &gt;=5% reported in the six comparator-controlled 24- to 30-week trials of BYDUREON used as monotherapy or as add-on to metformin, a sulfonylurea, a thiazolidinedione, or combination of these oral antidiabetic agents.

          Nausea was a common adverse reaction associated with initiation of treatment with BYDUREON and usually decreased over time.
 

   Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Withdrawal  

 The incidence of withdrawal due to adverse reactions was 4.1% (N=57) for BYDUREON-treated patients, 4.9% (N=13) for BYETTA-treated patients, and 2.9% (N=46) for other comparator-treated patients in the six comparator-controlled 24- to 30-week trials. The most common classes of adverse reactions (0.5%) leading to withdrawal for BYDUREON-treated patients were, Gastrointestinal Disorders 1.6% (N=22) versus 4.1% (N=11) for BYETTA and 1.9% (N=30) for other comparators, and Administration Site Conditions 0.8% (N=11) versus 0.0% for BYETTA and 0.2% (N=3) for other comparators. The most frequent adverse reactions within each of these respective classes were, nausea 0.4% (N=6) for BYDUREON versus 1.5% (N=4) for BYETTA and 0.8% (N=12) for other comparators, and injection-site nodule, 0.4% (N=6) for BYDUREON versus 0.0% for BYETTA and 0.0% for other comparators.

   Hypoglycemia  

 Table 3 summarizes the incidence of minor hypoglycemia in the six comparator-controlled 24- to 30-week trials of BYDUREON used as monotherapy or as add-on to metformin, a sulfonylurea, a thiazolidinedione, or combination of these oral antidiabetic agents. In these trials, an event was classified as minor hypoglycemia if there were symptoms of hypoglycemia with a concomitant glucose &lt;54 mg/dL and the patient was able to self-treat.

  N = number of intent-to-treat patients.Note: Percentages are based on the number of intent-to-treat patients in each treatment group.    
          Injection-Site Adverse Reactions  
 

 In the five comparator-controlled 24- to 30-week trials, injection-site reactions were observed more frequently in patients treated with BYDUREON (17.1%) than in patients treated with BYETTA (12.7%), titrated insulin glargine (1.8%), or those patients who received placebo injections (sitagliptin (10.6%), pioglitazone (6.4%), and metformin (13.0%) treatment groups). These reactions for patients treated with BYDUREON were more commonly observed in antibody-positive patients (14.2%) compared with antibody-negative patients (3.1%), with a greater incidence in those with higher titer antibodies  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.6)  ]  . Incidence of injection-site reactions for patients treated with BYETTA was similar for antibody-positive patients (5.8%) and antibody-negative patients (7.0%). One percent of patients treated with BYDUREON withdrew due to injection-site adverse reactions (injection-site mass, injection-site nodule, injection-site pruritus, and injection-site reaction).

 Subcutaneous injection-site nodules may occur with the use of BYDUREON. In a separate 15-week study in which information on nodules were collected and analyzed, 24 out of 31 subjects (77%) experienced at least 1 injection-site nodule during treatment; 2 subjects (6.5%) reported accompanying localized symptoms. The mean duration of events was 27 days. The formation of subcutaneous nodules is consistent with the known properties of the microspheres used in BYDUREON.

   Increase in Heart Rate  

 Increases in heart rate from baseline ranging from 1.5 to 4.5 beats per minute have been observed in comparator-controlled clinical trials. The long-term effects of the increase in heart rate have not been established.

 Other Adverse Reactions

 The following adverse reactions were also reported in three 30-week controlled trials of BYETTA (N=963) add-on to metformin and/or sulfonylurea, with an incidence of &gt;=1% and reported more frequently than with placebo: feeling jittery (9% BYETTA, 4% placebo), dizziness (9% BYETTA, 6% placebo), asthenia (4% BYETTA, 2% placebo), and hyperhidrosis (3% BYETTA, 1% placebo).

   6.2 Immunogenicity

  As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, the incidence of antibodies to exenatide cannot be directly compared with the incidence of antibodies with other products.

 Anti-exenatide antibodies were measured at prespecified intervals (4-14 weeks) in all BYDUREON-treated patients (N=918) in the five comparator-controlled studies of BYDUREON. In these five trials, 452 BYDUREON-treated patients (49%) had low titer antibodies (&lt;=125) to exenatide at any time during the trials and 405 BYDUREON-treated patients (45%) had low titer antibodies to exenatide at study endpoint (24-30 weeks). The level of glycemic control in these patients was generally comparable to that observed in the 379 BYDUREON-treated patients (43%) without antibody titers. An additional 107 BYDUREON-treated patients (12%) had higher titer antibodies at endpoint. Of these patients, 50 (6% overall) had an attenuated glycemic response to BYDUREON (&lt;0.7% reduction in HbA1c); the remaining 57 (6% overall) had a glycemic response comparable to that of patients without antibodies  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.6)  ]  . In the 30-week trial in which anti-exenatide antibody assessments were performed at baseline and at 4-week intervals from week 6 to week 30, the mean anti-exenatide antibody titer in the BYDUREON-treated patients peaked at week 6 then declined by 56% from this peak by week 30.

 A total of 246 patients with antibodies to exenatide in the BYETTA and BYDUREON clinical trials were tested for the presence of cross-reactive antibodies to GLP-1 and/or glucagon. No treatment-emergent cross-reactive antibodies were observed across the range of titers.

   6.3 Postmarketing Experience

  The following additional adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use of another formulation of exenatide. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

   Allergy/Hypersensitivity:  injection-site reactions, generalized pruritus and/or urticaria, macular or papular rash, angioedema; anaphylactic reaction.

   Drug Interactions:  increased international normalized ratio (INR), sometimes associated with bleeding, with concomitant warfarin use  [see  Drug Interactions (7)  ].  

   Gastrointestinal:  nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea resulting in dehydration; abdominal distension, abdominal pain, eructation, constipation, flatulence, acute pancreatitis, hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis sometimes resulting in death  [see  Indications and Usage (1)  ]  .

   Neurologic:  dysgeusia; somnolence

   Renal and Urinary Disorders:  altered renal function, including increased serum creatinine, renal impairment, worsened chronic renal failure or acute renal failure (sometimes requiring hemodialysis), kidney transplant and kidney transplant dysfunction.

   Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders:  alopecia

   5.1 Risk of Thyroid C-cell Tumors

  In both genders of rats, exenatide extended-release caused a dose-related and treatment-duration-dependent increase in the incidence of thyroid C-cell tumors (adenomas and/or carcinomas) at clinically relevant exposures compared to controls [see  Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)  ]  . A statistically significant increase in malignant thyroid C-cell carcinomas was observed in female rats receiving exenatide extended-release at 25-times clinical exposure compared to controls and higher incidences were noted in males above controls in all treated groups at &gt;=2-times clinical exposure. The potential of exenatide extended-release to induce C-cell tumors in mice has not been evaluated. Other GLP-1 receptor agonists have also induced thyroid C-cell adenomas and carcinomas in male and female mice and rats at clinically relevant exposures. It is unknown whether BYDUREON will cause thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans as the human relevance of exenatide extended-release-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined.

 Cases of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide, another GLP-1 receptor agonist, have been reported in the postmarketing period; the data in these reports are insufficient to establish or exclude a causal relationship between MTC and GLP-1 receptor agonist use in humans.

 BYDUREON is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with MEN 2. Counsel patients regarding the potential risk of MTC with the use of BYDUREON and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness).

 Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with BYDUREON. Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures, due to the low specificity of serum calcitonin testing for MTC and a high background incidence of thyroid disease. Significantly elevated serum calcitonin may indicate MTC and patients with MTC usually have values &gt;50 ng/L. If serum calcitonin is measured and found to be elevated, the patient should be further evaluated. Patients with thyroid nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging should also be further evaluated.

    5.2 Acute Pancreatitis

  Based on postmarketing data, exenatide has been associated with acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis. After initiation of BYDUREON, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis (including persistent severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back, which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting). If pancreatitis is suspected, BYDUREON should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated. If pancreatitis is confirmed, BYDUREON should not be restarted. Consider antidiabetic therapies other than BYDUREON in patients with a history of pancreatitis.

    5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin Secretagogues or Insulin

  The risk of hypoglycemia is increased when exenatide is used in combination with insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylureas) or insulin. Patients may require a lower dose of the secretagogue or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia in this setting [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .

    5.4 Acute Kidney Injury and Impairment of Renal Function

  There have been postmarketing reports of altered renal function with exenatide, including increased serum creatinine, renal impairment, worsened chronic renal failure and acute renal failure, sometimes requiring hemodialysis or kidney transplantation. Some of these events occurred in patients receiving one or more pharmacologic agents known to affect renal function or hydration status such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or diuretics. Some events occurred in patients who had been experiencing nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, with or without dehydration. Reversibility of altered renal function has been observed in many cases with supportive treatment and discontinuation of potentially causative agents, including exenatide. Exenatide has not been found to be directly nephrotoxic in preclinical or clinical studies.

 BYDUREON is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease and should be used with caution in patients with renal transplantation [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.6)  ]  . In patients with end-stage renal disease receiving dialysis, single doses of BYETTA 5 mcg were not well tolerated due to gastrointestinal side effects. Because BYDUREON may induce nausea and vomiting with transient hypovolemia, treatment may worsen renal function. Use BYDUREON with caution in patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min) [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.6)  and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  . BYDUREON has not been studied in patients with end-stage renal disease or severe renal impairment.

    5.5 Gastrointestinal Disease

  Exenatide has not been studied in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease, including gastroparesis. Because exenatide is commonly associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, the use of BYDUREON is not recommended in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease.

    5.6 Immunogenicity

  Patients may develop antibodies to exenatide following treatment with BYDUREON. Anti-exenatide antibodies were measured in BYDUREON-treated patients in five of the six comparator-controlled 24- to 30-week studies of BYDUREON. In 6% of BYDUREON-treated patients, antibody formation was associated with an attenuated glycemic response. If there is worsening glycemic control or failure to achieve targeted glycemic control, consider alternative antidiabetic therapy [see     Adverse Reactions (6.1)     and     (6.2)     ]  .

    5.7 Hypersensitivity

  There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis and angioedema) in patients treated with exenatide. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, the patient should discontinue BYDUREON and promptly seek medical advice [see  Contraindications (4)  ,     Adverse Reactions (6.3)     ]  . Inform and closely monitor patients with a history of anaphylaxis or angioedema with another GLP-1 receptor agonist for allergic reactions, because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to anaphylaxis with BYDUREON.

    5.8 Injection-Site Reactions

  There have been postmarketing reports of serious injection-site reactions (e.g., abscess, cellulitis, and necrosis), with or without subcutaneous nodules, with the use of BYDUREON. Isolated cases required surgical intervention [see     Adverse Reactions (6.1)     ]  .

    5.9 Macrovascular Outcomes

  There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with BYDUREON.
