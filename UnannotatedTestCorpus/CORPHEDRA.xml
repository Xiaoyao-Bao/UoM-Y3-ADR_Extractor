  The following adverse reactions associated with the use of ephedrine sulfate were identified in the literature. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency reliably or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Gastrointestinal disorders  : Nausea, vomiting



   C    ardiac disorders  : Tachycardia, palpitations (thumping heart), reactive hypertension, bradycardia, ventricular ectopics, R-R variability



   N    e    rvous system disorders  : Dizziness



   Psychiatric disorders  : Restlessness

   EXCERPT:   Most common adverse reactions during treatment: nausea, vomiting, and tachycardia.  (6)

  EXCERPT:          Pr   e   ssor Effect with Concomitant Oxytocic Drugs  : Pressor effect of sympathomimetic pressor amines is potentiated  (5.1)   



        T   ach   y   ph   y   l   a   x   i   s and Tolerance  : Repeated administration of ephedrine may cause tachyphylaxis  (5.2)   



 



    5.1 Pressor Effect with Concomitant Oxytocic Drugs  
 

  Serious postpartum hypertension has been described in patients who received both a vasopressor (i.e., methoxamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine) and an oxytocic (i.e., methylergonovine, ergonovine) [   see Drug Interactions (7)    ]. Some of these patients experienced a stroke. Carefully monitor the blood pressure of individuals who have received both ephedrine and an oxytocic.



     5.2 Tolerance and Tachyphylaxis  
 

  Data indicate that repeated administration of ephedrine can result in tachyphylaxis. Clinicians treating anesthesia-induced hypotension with CORPHEDRA should be aware of the possibility of tachyphylaxis and should be prepared with an alternative pressor to mitigate unacceptable responsiveness.



     5.3 Risk of Hypertension When Used Prophylactically  
 

  When used to prevent hypotension, ephedrine has been associated with an increased incidence of hypertension compared with when ephedrine is used to treat hypotension.
