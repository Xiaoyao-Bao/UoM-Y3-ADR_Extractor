    <Section id="S1" name="adverse reactions">    ADVERSE REACTIONS

  The most frequent side effect in clinical studies involving 1,133 patients was sedation which occurred in approximately two-thirds of the patients. Although sedated, these patients could easily be aroused to an alert state.



   Other less frequent adverse reactions occurring in 5-10% of the patients were:  



 Nausea Dizziness/Vertigo



   Occurring in 1-5% of the patients:  



 Sweating Headache



 Hypotension Nausea/Vomiting



 Vomiting Hypoventilation



 Miosis



   The following adverse reactions were reported to have occurred in less than 1% of the patients:  



   CNS Effect:  confusion, blurred vision, euphoria, weakness/fatigue, dry mouth, nervousness, depression, slurred speech, paresthesia.



   Cardiovascular:  hypertension, tachycardia, bradycardia.



   Gastrointestinal:  constipation.



   Respiratory:  dyspnea, cyanosis.



   Dermatological:  pruritus.



   Ophthalmological:  diplopia, visual abnormalities.



   Miscellaneous:  injection site reaction, urinary retention, dreaming, flushing/warmth, chills/cold, tinnitus, conjunctivitis, Wenckebach block, and psychosis.



 Other effects observed infrequently include malaise, hallucinations, depersonalization, coma, dyspepsia, flatulence, apnea, rash, amblyopia, tremor, and pallor.



 The following reactions have been reported to occur rarely: loss of appetite, dysphoria/agitation, diarrhea, urticaria, and convulsions/lack of muscle coordination.



   Allergic Reactions:  Cases of acute and chronic hypersensitivity to buprenorphine have been reported both in clinical trials and in the postmarketing experience of BUPRENEX and other buprenorphine- containing products. The most common signs and symptoms include rashes, hives, and pruritus. Cases of bronchospasm, angioneurotic edema, and anaphylactic shock have been reported. A history of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine is a contraindication to BUPRENEX.



 In the United Kingdom, buprenorphine hydrochloride was made available under monitored release regulation during the first year of sale, and yielded data from 1,736 physicians on 9,123 patients (17,120 administrations). Data on 240 children under the age of 18 years were included in this monitored release program. No important new adverse effects attributable to buprenorphine hydrochloride were observed.



   Postmarketing Experience

    Serotonin syndrome  : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs.



   Adrenal insufficiency  : Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use.



   Androgen deficiency  : Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with chronic use of opioids  [see  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacodynamics  ]  .

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: ADDICTION, ABUSE, AND MISUSE; LIFE-THREATENING RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION; NEONATAL OPIOID WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME and RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH BENZODIAZEPINES OR OTHER CNS DEPRESSANTS



  WARNING: ADDICTION, ABUSE, AND MISUSE; LIFE-THREATENING RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION; NEONATAL OPIOID WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME and RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH BENZODIAZEPINES OR OTHER CNS DEPRESSANTS



    Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse  



   BUPRENEX exposes patients and other users to the risks of opioid addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess each patient's risk prior to prescribing BUPRENEX, and monitor all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors and conditions (see   WARNINGS  ).  



   Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression  



   Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of BUPRENEX.  Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of BUPRENEX or following a dose increase (see   WARNINGS  )  .





   Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome  



   Prolonged use of BUPRENEX during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts.  If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available (see   WARNINGS  ).  



   Risks From Concomitant Use With Benzodiazepines Or Other CNS Depressants  



   Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death (see   WARNINGS  ,   PRECAUTIONS  )  .





 *  Reserve concomitant prescribing of BUPRENEX and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. 
 *  Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. 
</Section>
    <Section id="S3" name="precautions">    PRECAUTIONS



   General:  BUPRENEX should be administered with caution in the elderly, debilitated patients, in children and those with severe impairment of hepatic, pulmonary, or renal function; myxedema or hypothyroidism; adrenal cortical insufficiency (e.g., Addison's disease); CNS depression or coma; toxic psychoses; prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture; acute alcoholism; delirium tremens; or kyphoscoliosis.



 Because BUPRENEX is metabolized by the liver, the activity of BUPRENEX may be increased and/or extended in those individuals with impaired hepatic function or those receiving other agents known to decrease hepatic clearance.



 BUPRENEX has been shown to increase intracholedochal pressure to a similar degree as other opioid analgesics, and thus should be administered with caution to patients with dysfunction of the biliary tract.



    Information for Patients



   Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse



  Inform patients that the use of BUPRENEX, even when taken as recommended, can result in addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose or death [see  WARNINGS  ].  Instruct patients not to share BUPRENEX with others and to take steps to protect BUPRENEX from theft or misuse.



    Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression



  Inform patients of the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression, including information that the risk is greatest when starting BUPRENEX or when the dosage is increased, and that it can occur even at recommended dosages [see  WARNINGS  ].  Advise patients how to recognize respiratory depression and to seek medical attention if breathing difficulties develop.



    Serotonin Syndrome



  Inform patients that opioids could cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition resulting from concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs. Warn patients of the symptoms of serotonin syndrome and to seek medical attention right away if symptoms develop. Instruct patients to inform their healthcare providers if they are taking, or plan to take serotonergic medications [see  PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions  ].  



    Constipation



  Advise patients of the potential for severe constipation, including management instructions and when to seek medical attention [see  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacodynamics  ,  ADVERSE REACTIONS  ].  



    Drug Interactions



    Clinically significant drug interactions with BUPRENEX. 
  Benzodiazepines and Other Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants     
  Clinical Impact:          Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death.   
  Intervention:             Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients closely for signs of respiratory depression and sedation [see  WARNINGS  ].     
  Examples:                 Benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, and other opioids, alcohol.   
  Inhibitors of CYP3A4       
  Clinical Impact:          The concomitant use of buprenorphine and CYP3A4 inhibitors can increase the plasma concentration of buprenorphine, resulting in increased or prolonged opioid effects, particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of BUPRENEX is achieved.After stopping a CYP3A4 inhibitor, as the effects of the inhibitor decline, the buprenorphine plasma concentration will decrease [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics]  , potentially resulting in decreased opioid efficacy or a withdrawal syndrome in patients who had developed physical dependence to buprenorphine.   
  Intervention:             If concomitant use is necessary, consider dosage reduction of BUPRENEX until stable drug effects are achieved. Monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals.If a CYP3A4 inhibitor is discontinued, consider increasing the BUPRENEX dosage until stable drug effects are achieved. Monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal.   
  Examples:                 Macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g. ketoconazole), protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir)   
  CYP3A4 Inducers            
  Clinical Impact:          The concomitant use of buprenorphine and CYP3A4 inducers can decrease the plasma concentration of buprenorphine [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics]   ,  potentially resulting in decreased efficacy or onset of a withdrawal syndrome in patients who have developed physical dependence to buprenorphine.After stopping a CYP3A4 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the buprenorphine plasma concentration will increase [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics]   ,  which could increase or prolong both therapeutic effects and adverse reactions and may cause serious respiratory depression.   
  Intervention:             If concomitant use is necessary, consider increasing the BUPRENEX dosage until stable drug effects are achieved. Monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal.If a CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued, consider BUPRENEX dosage reduction and monitor for signs of respiratory depression.   
  Examples:                 Rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin                                           
  Serotonergic Drugs         
  Clinical Impact:          The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome.   
  Intervention:             If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue BUPRENEX if serotonin syndrome is suspected.   
  Examples:                 Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue).   
  Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)     
  Clinical Impact:          MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma).   
  Intervention:             The use of BUPRENEX is not recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment.   
  Examples:                 phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid                                       
  Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics     
  Clinical Impact:          May reduce the analgesic effect of BUPRENEX and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.   
  Intervention:             Avoid concomitant use.                                                       
  Examples:                 butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine                                         
  Muscle Relaxants           
  Clinical Impact:          Buprenorphine may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression.   
  Intervention:             Monitor patients receiving muscle relaxants and BUPRENEX for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected and decrease the dosage of BUPRENEX and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary.   
  Diuretics                  
  Clinical Impact:          Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone.   
  Intervention:             Monitor patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed.   
  Anticholinergic Drugs      
  Clinical Impact:          The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase the risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus.   
  Intervention:             Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when BUPRENEX is used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs.   
  Antiretrovirals: Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs)     
  Clinical Impact:          Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) do not appear to induce or inhibit the P450 enzyme pathway, thus no interactions with buprenorphine are expected.   
  Intervention:             None                                                                         
  Antiretrovirals: Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs)     
  Clinical Impact:          Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are metabolized principally by CYP3A4. Efavirenz, nevirapine, and etravirine are known CYP3A inducers, whereas delaviridine is a CYP3A inhibitor. Significant pharmacokinetic interactions between NNRTIs (e.g., efavirenz and delavirdine) and buprenorphine have been shown in clinical studies, but these pharmacokinetic interactions did not result in any significant pharmacodynamic effects.   
  Intervention:             Patients who are on chronic BUPRENEX treatment should have their dose monitored if NNRTIs are added to their treatment regimen.   
  Examples:                 efavirenz, nevirapine, etravirine, delavirdine                               
  Antiretrovirals: Protease inhibitors (PIs)     
  Clinical Impact:          Studies have shown some antiretroviral protease inhibitors (PIs) with CYP3A4 inhibitory activity (nelfinavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, ritonavir) have little effect on buprenorphine pharmacokinetic and no significant pharmacodynamic effects. Other PIs with CYP3A4 inhibitory activity (atazanavir and atazanavir/ritonavir) resulted in elevated levels of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine, and patients in one study reported increased sedation. Symptoms of opioid excess have been found in post-marketing reports of patients receiving buprenorphine and atazanavir with and without ritonavir concomitantly.   
  Intervention:             Monitor patients taking BUPRENEX and atazanavir with and without ritonavir, and dose reduction of BUPRENEX may be warranted.   
  Examples:                 atazanavir, ritonavir                                                        
           Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility
 

   Carcinogenesis



  Carcinogenicity studies were conducted in Sprague-Dawley rats and CD-1 mice. Buprenorphine was administered in the diet at doses of 0.6, 5.5, and 56 mg/kg/day for 27 months in rats. These doses were approximately equivalent to 5.7, 52, and 534 times the recommended human dose (1.2 mg) on a mg/m  2  body surface area basis. Statistically significant dose-related increases in testicular interstitial (Leydig's) cell tumors occurred, according to the trend test adjusted for survival. Pairwise comparison of the high dose against control failed to show statistical significance. In the mouse study, buprenorphine was administered in the diet at doses of 8, 50, and 100 mg/kg/day for 86 weeks.



 The high dose was approximately equivalent to 477 times the recommended human dose (1.2 mg) on a mg/m  2  basis. Buprenorphine was not carcinogenic in mice.



    Mutagenesis



  Buprenorphine was studied in a series of tests. Results were negative in Chinese hamster bone marrow and spermatogonia cells, and negative in mouse lymphoma L5178Y assay. Results were equivocal in the Ames test: negative in studies in two laboratories, but positive in frame shift mutation at high dose (5 mg/plate) in a third study.



    Impairment of Fertility



  Reproduction studies of buprenorphine in rats demonstrated no evidence of impaired fertility at daily oral doses up to 80mg/kg (approximately 763 times the recommended human daily dose of 1.2 mg on a mg/m  2  basis) or up to 5mg/kg I.M. or S.C. (approximately 48 times the recommended human daily dose of 1.2 mg on a mg/m  2  basis).



    Pregnancy



   Risk Summary



  Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy may cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [see  WARNINGS: Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome  ].  Available data with BUPRENEX in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage.



 Reproductive and developmental studies in rats and rabbits identified adverse events at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 1.8 mg/day of BUPREXEX. Embryofetal death was observed in both rats and rabbits administered buprenorphine during the period of organogenesis at doses approximately 54 and 2.2 times, respectively, the MRHD of 1.8 mg/day of buprenorphine. Pre-and postnatal development studies in rats demonstrated increased neonatal deaths at 2.7 times and above and dystocia at approximately 27 times the MRHD of 1.8 mg/day of buprenorphine. No clear teratogenic effects were seen when buprenorphine was administered during organogenesis with a range of doses 5 times or greater than the MRHD of 1.8 mg/day of buprenorphine. However, increases in skeletal abnormalities were noted in rats and rabbits administered buprenorphine daily during organogenesis at doses approximately 5.4 and 10.8 times the MRHD of 1.8 mg/day of buprenorphine, respectively. In a few studies, some events such as acephalus and omphalocele were also observed but these findings were not clearly treatment-related [see  Data  ].  Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.



 The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.



    Clinical Considerations



   Fetal/neonatal adverse reactions



  Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome may occur in newborn infants of mothers who are receiving treatment with BUPREENX.



 Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea, and/or failure to gain weight. Signs of neonatal withdrawal usually occur in the first days after birth. The duration and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome may vary. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly [see  WARNINGS: Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome  ].  



    Labor and Delivery



  The safety of BUPRENEX given during labor and delivery has not been established. As with all opioids, use of buprenorphine prior to delivery may result in respiratory depression in the newborn.



 Closely monitor neonates for signs of respiratory depression. An opioid antagonist such as naloxone should be available for reversal of opioid induced respiratory depression in the neonate.



    Data



   Human Data



  Studies have been conducted to evaluate neonatal outcomes in women exposed to buprenorphine during pregnancy. Limited published data on malformations from trials, observational studies, case series, and case reports on buprenorphine use in pregnancy have not shown an increased risk of major malformations. Based on these studies the incidence of neonatal abstinence syndrome is not clear and there does not appear to be a dose-response relationship.



    Animal Data



  The exposure margins listed below are based on body surface area comparisons (mg/m  2  ) to MRHD of 1.8 mg buprenorphine via BUPRENEX.



 Following oral administration to rats no teratogenic effects were observed at buprenorphine doses up to 250 mg/kg/day (estimated exposure approximately 1351 times the MRHD of 1.8 mg) in the presence of maternal toxicity (mortality). Following oral administration to rabbits, no teratogenic effects were observed at buprenorphine doses up to 40 mg/kg/day (estimated exposure approximately 432 times the MRHD of 1.8 mg) in the absence of clear maternal toxicity.



 No definitive drug-related teratogenic effects were observed in rats and rabbits at IM doses up to 30 mg/kg/day (estimated exposure approximately 161 times and 324 times, respectively, the MRHD of 1.8 mg). Maternal toxicity resulting in mortality was noted in these studies in both rats and rabbits. Acephalus was observed in one rabbit fetus from the low-dose group and omphalocele was observed in two rabbit fetuses from the same litter in the mid-dose group; no findings were observed in fetuses from the high-dose group. Maternal toxicity was seen in the high-dose group but not at the lower doses where the findings were observed. Following oral administration of buprenorphine to rats, dose-related post-implantation losses, evidenced by increases in the numbers of early resorptions with consequent reductions in the numbers of fetuses, were observed at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater (estimated exposure approximately 54 times the MRHD of 1.8 mg).



 In the rabbit, increased post-implantation losses occurred at an oral dose of 40 mg/kg/day. Following IM administration in the rat and the rabbit, post-implantation losses, as evidenced by decreases in live fetuses and increases in resorptions, occurred at 30 mg/kg/day.



 Buprenorphine was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits after IM or subcutaneous (SC) doses up to 5 mg/kg/day (estimated exposure was approximately 27 and 54 times, respectively, the MRHD of 1.8 mg), after IV doses up to 0.8 mg/kg/day (estimated exposure was approximately 4.3 and 8.7 times, respectively, the MRHD of 1.8 mg), or after oral doses up to 160 mg/kg/day in rats (estimated exposure was approximately 865 times the MRHD of 1.8 mg) and 25 mg/kg/day in rabbits (estimated exposure was approximately 270 times the MRHD of 1.8 mg). Significant increases in skeletal abnormalities (e.g., extra thoracic vertebra or thoraco-lumbar ribs) were noted in rats after SC administration of 1 mg/kg/day and up (estimated exposure was approximately 5.4 times the MRHD of 1.8 mg), but were not observed at oral doses up to 160 mg/kg/day.



 Increases in skeletal abnormalities in rabbits after IM administration of 5 mg/kg/day (estimated exposure was approximately 54 times the MRHD of 1.8 mg) in the absence of maternal toxicity or oral administration of 1 mg/kg/day or greater (estimated exposure was approximately 10.8 times the MRHD of 1.8 mg) were not statistically significant.



 In rabbits, buprenorphine produced statistically significant pre-implantation losses at oral doses of 1 mg/kg/day or greater and post-implantation losses that were statistically significant at IV doses of 0.2 mg/kg/day or greater (estimated exposure approximately 2.2 times the MRHD of 1.8 mg). No maternal toxicity was noted at doses causing post-implantation loss in this study.



 Dystocia was noted in pregnant rats treated intramuscularly with buprenorphine from Gestation Day 14 through Lactation Day 21 at 5 mg/kg/day (approximately 27 times the MRHD of 1.8 mg).



 Fertility, pre-, and post-natal development studies with buprenorphine in rats indicated increases in neonatal mortality after oral doses of 0.8 mg/kg/day and up (approximately 4.3 times the MRHD of 1.8 mg), after IM doses of 0.5 mg/kg/day and up (approximately 2.7 times the MRHD of 1.8 mg), and after SC doses of 0.1 mg/kg/day and up (approximately 0.5 times the MRHD of 1.8 mg). An apparent lack of milk production during these studies likely contributed to the decreased pup viability and lactation indices. Delays in the occurrence of righting reflex and startle response were noted in rat pups at an oral dose of 80 mg/kg/day (approximately 432 times the MRHD of 1.8 mg).



    Lactation



  An apparent lack of milk production during general reproduction studies with buprenorphine in rats caused decreased viability and lactation indices. Use of high doses of sublingual buprenorphine in pregnant women showed that buprenorphine passes into the mother's milk. Breast-feeding is therefore not advised in nursing mothers treated with BUPRENEX.



    Females and Males of Reproductive Potential



   Infertility



  Chronic use of opioids may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see  ADVERSE REACTIONS  ].  



    Pediatric Use



  The safety and effectiveness of BUPRENEX have been established for children between 2 and 12 years of age. Use of BUPRENEX in children is supported by evidence from adequate and well controlled trials of BUPRENEX in adults, with additional data from studies of 960 children ranging in age from 9 months to 18 years of age. Data is available from a pharmacokinetic study, several controlled clinical trials, and several large post-marketing studies and case series. The available information provides reasonable evidence that BUPRENEX may be used safely in children ranging from 2-12 years of age, and that it is of similar effectiveness in children as in adults.



    Geriatric Use



  Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to buprenorphine. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.



 Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of BUPRENEX slowly in geriatric patients and monitor closely for signs of respiratory depression [see  WARNINGS  ,  PRECAUTIONS  ].  



 Buprenorphine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.
</Section>
    <Section id="S4" name="warnings">    WARNINGS



   Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse



  BUPRENEX contains buprenorphine, a Schedule III controlled substance. As an opioid, BUPRENEX exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse.



 Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed BUPRENEX. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused.



 Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing BUPRENEX, and monitor all patients receiving BUPRENEX for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol addiction or abuse) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the prescribing of BUPRENEX for the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as BUPRENEX, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of BUPRENEX along with the intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse.



 Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing BUPRENEX. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.



    Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression



  Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory depression and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status. Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.



 While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of BUPRENEX, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24 to 72 hours of initiating therapy with and following dosage increases of BUPRENEX.



 To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of BUPRENEX are essential. Overestimating the BUPRENEX dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose.



    Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome



  Prolonged use of BUPRENEX during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see  WARNINGS  ,  PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients  ,  Pregnancy  ].  



    Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants



  Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of BUPRENEX with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.



 Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and



 benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see  Drug Interactions  ].  



 If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of



 respiratory depression and sedation.



 Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when BUPRENEX is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [see  Drug Interactions  , and  Information for Patients  ].  



    Risk of Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients



  The use of BUPRENEX in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated.



    Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease  : BUPRENEX-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive, including apnea, even at recommended dosages of BUPRENEX [see  WARNINGS  ]  .



    Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients  : Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients.



 Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating BUPRENEX and when BUPRENEX is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see  WARNINGS  ].  Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients.



    Adrenal Insufficiency



  Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.



    QTc Prolongation



  Buprenorphine has been observed to prolong the QTc interval in some subjects participating in clinical trials. Consider these observations in clinical decisions when prescribing BUPRENEX to patients with hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or clinically unstable cardiac disease, including unstable atrial fibrillation, symptomatic bradycardia, unstable congestive heart failure, or active myocardial ischemia. Periodic electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring is recommended in these patients. Avoid the use of BUPRENEX in patients with a history of Long QT Syndrome or an immediate family member with this condition or those taking Class IA antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide) or Class III antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., sotalol, amiodarone, dofetilide), or other medications that prolong the QT interval [see  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  ,  ADVERSE REACTIONS  , and  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  ].  



    Severe Hypotension



  BUPRENEX may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume, or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics). Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of BUPRENEX. In patients with circulatory shock, BUPRENEX may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of BUPRENEX in patients with circulatory shock.



    Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness



  In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), BUPRENEX may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with BUPRENEX.



 Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury.



 Avoid the use of BUPRENEX in patients with impaired consciousness or coma.



    Anaphylactic/Allergic Reactions



  Cases of acute and chronic hypersensitivity to buprenorphine have been reported both in clinical trials and in post-marketing experience. The most common signs and symptoms include rashes, hives, and pruritus. Cases of bronchospasm, angioneurotic edema, and anaphylactic shock have been reported. BUPRENEX is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine.



    Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions



  BUPRENEX is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus.



 The buprenorphine in BUPRENEX may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in the serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms.



    Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders



  The buprenorphine in BUPRENEX may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during BUPRENEX therapy.



    Risks Driving and Operating Machinery



  BUPRENEX may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of BUPRENEX and know how they will react to the medication [see  PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients  ].
