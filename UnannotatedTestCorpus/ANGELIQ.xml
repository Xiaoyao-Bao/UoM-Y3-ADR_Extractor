  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 From clinical trials with different dose formulations of Angeliq containing E2 dose ranging from 0.5 mg to 1.0 mg combined with DRSP dose ranging from 0.25 mg to 3 mg:



 *    The most common adverse reactions were gastrointestinal and abdominal pain, female genital bleeding, breast pain and headache. The frequencies of common adverse reactions, in general, were higher for the Angeliq dose formulation containing E2 1 mg compared to Angeliq containing E2 0.5 mg. 
 *    The most common adverse reactions leading to drug discontinuation in controlled clinical trials were abdominal pain, headache, postmenopausal bleeding, breast tenderness, and weight increased. 
      Placebo-Controlled Trial:
   In a placebo-controlled trial evaluating Angeliq 0.25 mg DRSP/0.5 mg E2, 183 postmenopausal women received at least one dose of DRSP 0.25 mg/0.5 mg E2 and 180 received placebo. Study subjects were treated for 3 cycles of 28 days each for a total of 12 weeks of treatment. The median age was 53 years (range: 40-77 years) and over 50% of subjects had a hysterectomy, 68% were Caucasian and 24% were Black. Table 1 summarizes adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of subjects receiving Angeliq 0.25 mg DRS/0.5 mg E2 and at a higher incidence than subjects receiving placebo.

           Pooled data of clinical trials with different dose formulations of Angeliq:
   Data from 13 clinical trials in postmenopausal subjects treated with different dose formulations of Angeliq containing 1 mg E2 (1 mg E2 + 0.5 mg - 3.0 mg DRSP; N=2842) were pooled to provide an overall estimate of adverse reactions. Similarly, data from 2 clinical trials with Angeliq containing 0.5 mg E2 (0.5 mg E2 + DRSP 0.25 mg - 0.5 mg; N=853) were pooled for the same purpose. Table 2 shows adverse reactions reported in at least 1% of subjects treated with Angeliq.

         Adverse Reactions in clinical studies were coded using the MedDRA dictionary (version 13.0). Different MedDRA terms representing the same medical phenomenon have been grouped together as single adverse reactions to avoid diluting or obscuring the true effect.
 

   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following additional adverse reactions have been reported during post approval use of Angeliq. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, reliably estimating their frequency or establishing a causal relationship to drug exposure is not always possible.



   Immune System Disorders:  Hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, pruritis, and urticaria



   Reproductive system and breast disorders  : Breast cancer



   Vascular disorders  : venous and arterial thromboembolic events (peripheral deep venous occlusion, thrombosis and embolism/pulmonary vascular occlusion, thrombosis, embolism and infarction/myocardial infarction/cerebral infarction and stroke not specified as hemorrhagic)

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS, BREAST CANCER, ENDOMETRIAL CANCER and PROBABLE DEMENTIA

  WARNING: CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS, BREAST CANCER, ENDOMETRIAL CANCER and PROBABLE DEMENTIA

      Estrogen Plus Progestin Therapy    



   Cardiovascular Disorders and Probable Dementia  



   Estrogen plus progestin therapy should not be used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or dementia   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  ,   5.4  ) and Clinical Studies (  14.4  ,   14.5  )]  .   



   The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), stroke and myocardial infarction (MI) in postmenopausal women (50 to 79 years of age) during 5.6 years of treatment with daily oral conjugated estrogens (CE) [0.625 mg] combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) [2.5 mg], relative to placebo   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  ), and Clinical Studies (  14.5  )].     



   The WHI Memory Study (WHIMS) estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI reported an increased risk of developing probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age or older during 4 years of treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg) combined with MPA (2.5 mg), relative to placebo. It is unknown whether this finding applies to younger postmenopausal women   [see Warnings and Precautions (    5.4  )   , Use in Specific Populations (  8.5  ), and Clinical Studies (  14.5  )].      



   Breast Cancer  



   The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy demonstrated an increased risk of invasive breast cancer   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  ), and Clinical Studies (  14.4  )]  .  



   In the absence of comparable data, these risks should be assumed to be similar for other doses of CE and MPA and other combinations and dosage forms of estrogens and progestins.   



   Estrogens with or without progestins should be prescribed at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman.  



     Estrogen-Alone Therapy    



   Endometrial Cancer  



   There is an increased risk of endometrial cancer in a woman with a uterus who uses unopposed estrogens. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. Adequate diagnostic measures, including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  )]  .  



   Cardiovascular Disorders and Probable Dementia  



   Estrogen-alone therapy should not be used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or dementia   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  ,   5.4  ) and Clinical Studies (  14.5  ,   14.4  )].    



   The WHI estrogen-alone substudy reported increased risks of stroke and DVT in postmenopausal women (50 to 79 years of age) during 7.1 years of treatment with daily oral CE (0.625 mg)-alone relative to placebo   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  ), and Clinical Studies (  14.5  )].    



   The WHIMS estrogen-alone ancillary study of WHI reported an increased risk of developing probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age or older during 5.2 years of treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone, relative to placebo. It is unknown whether this finding applies to younger postmenopausal women   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.4  ), Use in Specific Populations (  8.5  ), and Clinical Studies (  14.5  )]  .  



   In the absence of comparable data, these risks should be assumed to be similar for other doses of CE and other forms of estrogens. Estrogens with or without progestins should be prescribed at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman.

    BOXED WARNING: 

    FDA-Approved Patient LabelingPATIENT INFORMATION  



   Angeliq  (r)   (an"ju-le-k')     (drospirenone and estradiol)  



   Tablets  



 Read this Patient Information before you start taking Angeliq and each time you refill your Angeliq prescription. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment.



   

    What is the most important information I should know about Angeliq (combination of estrogen and progestin hormones)?  



 *  Do not use estrogens with progestins to prevent heart disease, heart attacks, strokes, or dementia (declines of brain function) 
 *  Using estrogens with progestins may increase your chances of getting heart attacks, strokes, breast cancer, or blood clots 
 *  Using estrogens with progestins may increase your chance of getting dementia, based on a study of women 65 years of age or older 
 *  Do not use estrogen-alone to prevent heart disease, heart attacks, strokes or dementia 
 *  Using estrogen-alone may increase your chance of getting cancer of the uterus (womb) 
 *  Using estrogen-alone may increase your chances of getting strokes or blood clots 
 *  Using estrogen-alone may increase your chance of getting dementia, based on a study of women 65 years of age or older 
 *  You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with Angeliq 
       
 

   What is Angeliq?  



 Angeliq is a medicine that contains 2 kinds of hormones, estrogen and progestin. 



 *  Angeliq 0.25 mg drospirenone (DRSP)/0.5 mg estradiol (E2) and Angeliq 0.5 mg DRSP/1 mg E2 are both used after menopause to reduce moderate to severe hot flashes. 
 *  Estrogens are hormones made by a woman's ovaries. The ovaries normally stop making estrogens when a woman is between 45 to 55 years old. This drop in body estrogen levels causes the "change of life" or menopause (the end of monthly menstrual periods). Sometimes, both ovaries are removed during an operation before natural menopause takes place. The sudden drop in estrogen levels causes "surgical menopause." 
 *  When the estrogen levels begin dropping, some women develop very uncomfortable symptoms, such as feelings of warmth in the face, neck, and chest, or sudden strong feelings of heat and sweating ("hot flashes" or "hot flushes"). In some women, the symptoms are mild, and they will not need estrogens. In other women, symptoms can be more severe. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with Angeliq. 
 *  Angeliq 0.5 mg drospirenone (DRSP)/1 mg estradiol (E2) is used after menopause to treat moderate to severe dryness, itching, and burning in or around the vagina. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with Angeliq to control these problems. If you use Angeliq only to treat dryness, itching, and burning in and around your vagina, talk with your healthcare provider about whether a topical vaginal product would be better for you. 
      Who should not take Angeliq?   
 

 Do not start taking Angeliq if you:



 *  have had your uterus removed (hysterectomy). 
 *  Angeliq contains a progestin to decrease the chances of getting cancer of the uterus. If you do not have a uterus, you do not need a progestin and you should not use Angeliq. 
 *  have unusual vaginal bleeding. Vaginal bleeding after menopause may be a warning sign of cancer of the uterus (womb). Your healthcare provider should check any unusual vaginal bleeding to find out the cause. 
 *  currently have or have had certain cancers. Estrogens may increase the chances of getting certain types of cancers, including cancer of the breast or uterus. If you have or had cancer, talk with your healthcare provider about whether you should take Angeliq. 
 *  had a stroke or heart attack in the past year. 
 *  currently have or have had blood clots. 
 *  have kidney disease, liver disease, or disease of your adrenal glands. Angeliq contains drospirenone which may increase the potassium level in your blood. Liver, kidney, or adrenal gland disease may also increase the potassium level in your blood. 
 *  have been diagnosed with a bleeding disorder. 
 *  are allergic to Angeliq or any of its ingredients. See the end of this leaflet for a list of ingredients in Angeliq. 
 *  are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. 
      What should I tell my healthcare provider before taking Angeliq?   
 

 Before you take Angeliq, tell your healthcare provider if you:



 *  have or have had problems with your adrenal glands. 
 *  have high levels of fat in your blood (triglycerides) 
 *  have any other medical conditions. Your healthcare provider may need to check you more carefully if you have certain conditions, such as: ∘asthma (wheezing)∘epilepsy (seizures)∘migraine∘endometriosis∘lupus∘hypertension (high blood pressure)∘problems with your heart, liver, thyroid or kidneys∘benign breast disease∘have high calcium in your blood∘have high potassium levels in your blood∘have low sodium levels in your blood 
 *  are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Angeliq is not for pregnant women. If you think you may be pregnant, you should have a pregnancy test and know the results before you start taking Angeliq. 
 *  are breastfeeding or planning to breastfeed. You should not breastfeed while taking Angeliq. The hormone in Angeliq can decrease the amount of breast milk you make. Also, the hormone in Angeliq can pass into your milk. Talk to your healthcare provider about the best way to feed your baby if you take Angeliq. 
      Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take,   including prescription and nonprescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Some medicines may affect how Angeliq works. Some other medicines and food products may increase or decrease the concentrations of the hormones in Angeliq in the blood. Angeliq may also affect how your other medicines work. Angeliq may increase the potassium level in your blood and some medicines may also increase potassium level.  In some situations, your healthcare provider may recommend testing your blood for potassium level.
 

 Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them to show your doctor and pharmacist when you get a new medicine.



   If you are going to have surgery or will be on bed rest.   Your healthcare provider will let you know if you need to stop taking Angeliq.



   How should I take Angeliq?  



 *  Take one Angeliq tablet at the same time each day. 
 *  Take Angeliq tablets whole. Do not break, crush, dissolve, or chew Angeliq tablets before swallowing. If you cannot swallow Angeliq tablets whole, tell your healthcare provider. You may need a different medicine. 
 *  If you miss a dose of Angeliq, take it as soon as possible. 
 *  If more than 24 hours have passed since you missed a dose of Angeliq, you should not take the missed dose. 
 *  Estrogens should be used at the lowest dose possible for your treatment only as long as needed. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly (for example, every 3 to 6 months) about whether you still need treatment with Angeliq. 
      What are the possible side effects of Angeliq?  
 

   Angeliq may cause serious side effects.   



   Serious but less common side effects include:  



 *  Heart attack

   EXCERPT:    *    Do not use with conditions that predispose to hyperkalemia (  5.2  ) 
 *    Estrogens increase the risk of gallbladder disease (  5.5  ) 
 *    Discontinue estrogen if severe hypercalcemia, loss of vision, severe hypertriglyceridemia or cholestatic jaundice occurs (  5.6  ,  5.7  ,  5.9  ,  5.10  ) 
 *    Monitor thyroid function in women on thyroid replacement therapy (  5.11  ,  5.19  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Cardiovascular Disorders



  An increased risk of PE, DVT, stroke and MI have been reported with estrogen plus progestin therapy. An increased risk of stroke and DVT have been reported with estrogen-alone therapy. Should any of these occur or be suspected, estrogen with or without progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately.



 Risk factors for arterial vascular disease (for example, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, and/or obesity) and/or venous thromboembolism (VTE) [for example, personal history or family history of VTE, obesity, systemic lupus erythematosus] should be managed appropriately.



    Stroke



  In the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (33 versus 25 per 10,000 women years) [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]  . The increase in risk was demonstrated after the first year and persisted.  1  Should a stroke occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately.



 In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (45 versus 33 per 10,000 women-years). The increase in risk was demonstrated in year one and persisted [see Clinical Studies (  14.4  )]  . Should a stroke occur or be suspected, estrogen-alone therapy should be discontinued immediately.



 Subgroup analyses of women 50 to 59 years of age suggest no increased risk of stroke for those women receiving CE (0.625 mg)-alone versus those receiving placebo (18 versus 21 per 10,000 women-years).  1  



    Coronary Heart Disease



  In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, there was a statistically non-significant increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) events (defined as nonfatal MI, silent MI, or CHD death) reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (41 versus 34 per 10,000 women-years).  1  An increase in relative risk was demonstrated in year 1, and a trend toward decreasing relative risk was reported in years 2 through 5 [see Clinical Studies (  14.4  )]  .



 In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, no overall effect on CHD events was reported in women receiving estrogen-alone compared to placebo  2   [see Clinical Studies (  14.4  )]  .



 Subgroup analyses of women 50 to 59 years of age suggest a statistically non-significant reduction in CHD events (CE 0.625 mg compared to placebo) in women with less than 10 years since menopause (8 versus 16 per 10,000 women-years).  1  



 In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease (n=2,763), average 66.7 years of age, in a controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study [HERS]), treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) demonstrated no cardiovascular benefit. During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with CE plus MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established CHD. There were more CHD events in the CE plus MPA-treated group than in the placebo group in year 1, but not during the subsequent years. Two thousand, three hundred and twenty-one (2,321) women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open label extension of HERS, HERS II. Average follow-up in HERS II was an additional 2.7 years, for a total of 6.8 years overall. Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CE plus MPA group and the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, and overall.



    Venous Thromboembolism



  In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant 2-fold greater rate of VTE (DVT and PE) was reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (35 versus 17 per 10,000 women-years). Statistically significant increases in risk for both DVT (26 versus 13 per 10,000 women-years) and PE (18 versus 8 per 10,000 women-years) were also demonstrated. The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first year and persisted  3   [see Clinical Studies (  14.4  )]  . Should a VTE occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately.



 In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, the risk of VTE was increased for women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone compared to placebo (30 versus 22 per 10,000 women-years), although only the increased risk of DVT reached statistical significance (23 versus 15 per 10,000 women-years). The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first 2 years  4   [see Clinical Studies (  14.4  )]  . Should a VTE occur or be suspected, estrogen-alone therapy should be discontinued immediately.



 If feasible, estrogens should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization.



    5.2 Hyperkalemia



  Angeliq contains the progestin DRSP that has antialdosterone activity, including the potential for hyperkalemia in high-risk patients. Angeliq is contraindicated in patients with conditions that predispose to hyperkalemia (renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and adrenal insufficiency).



 Use caution when prescribing Angeliq to women who regularly take other medications that can increase potassium, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor antagonists, heparin and aldosterone antagonists. Consider monitoring serum potassium concentrations during the first month of dosing in high-risk patients who take strong CYP3A4 inhibitors long-term and concomitantly. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include azole antifungals (for example, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors (for example, indinavir, boceprevir), and clarithromycin [see Drug Interactions (  7.1  ) and Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )].  



    5.3 Malignant Neoplasms



   Breast Cancer



  The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen plus progestin users is the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg). After a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, the estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk of breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA. In this substudy, prior use of estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women. The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24 and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86 and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09 and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10,000 women-years for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. In the same substudy, invasive breast cancers were larger, were more likely to be node positive, and were diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) group compared with the placebo group. Metastatic disease was rare, with no apparent difference between the two groups. Other prognostic factors, such as histologic subtype, grade and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups  5   [see Clinical Studies (  14.4  )].  



 The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen-alone users is the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer [relative risk [see Clinical Studies (  14.4  )]  .



 Consistent with the WHI clinical trial, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller increased risk for estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use. The risk increased with duration of use, and appeared to return to baseline over about 5 years after stopping treatment (only the observational studies have substantial data on risk after stopping). Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not generally found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, doses, or routes of administration.



 The use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation.



 All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results.



    Endometrial Cancer



  An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in a woman with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2- to 12-fold greater than in non-users, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more. This risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued.



 Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding.



 There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy in postmenopausal women has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer.



    Ovarian Cancer



  The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically non-significant increased risk of ovarian cancer. After an average follow-up of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95 percent CI, 0.77-3.24). The absolute risk for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 4 versus 3 cases per 10,000 women-years.   7    



  A meta-analysis of 17 prospective and 35 retrospective epidemiology studies found that women who used hormonal therapy for menopausal symptoms had an increased risk for ovarian cancer. The primary analysis, using case-control comparisons, included 12,110 cancer cases from the 17 prospective studies. The relative risks associated with current use of hormonal therapy was 1.41 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32 to 1.50); there was no difference in the risk estimates by duration of the exposure (less than 5 years [median of 3 years]vs. greater than 5 years [median of 10 years] of use before the cancer diagnosis). The relative risk associated with combined current and recent use (discontinued use within 5 years before cancer diagnosis) was 1.37 (95% CI 1.27 to 1.48), and the elevated risk was significant for both estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin products. The exact duration of hormone therapy use associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer, however, is unknown.  



    5.4 Probable Dementia



  In the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) estrogen plus progestin ancillary study, a population of 4,532 postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) or placebo. After an average follow-up of 4 years, 40 women in the CE plus MPA group and 21 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia.  The relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21-3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10,000 women-years  8   [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.5  ), and Clinical Studies (  14.5  )]  .



 In the WHIMS estrogen-alone ancillary study of WHI, a population of 2,947 hysterectomized women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone or placebo. After an average follow-up of 5.2 years, 28 women in the estrogen-alone group and 19 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 1.49 (95 percent CI, 0.83-2.66). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 37 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years  8   [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.5  ) and Clinical Studies (  14.5  )].  



 When data from the two populations in the WHIMS estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin ancillary studies were pooled as planned in the WHIMS protocol, the reported overall relative risk for probable dementia was 1.76 (95 percent CI 1.19-2.60). Since both ancillary studies were conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women  8   [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.5  ) and Clinical Studies (  14.5  )]  .



    5.5 Gallbladder Disease



  A 2- to 4-fold increase in the risk of gallbladder disease requiring surgery in postmenopausal women receiving estrogens has been reported.



    5.6 Hypercalcemia



  Estrogen administration may lead to severe hypercalcemia in women with breast cancer and bone metastases. If hypercalcemia occurs, use of the drug should be stopped and appropriate measures taken to reduce the serum calcium concentration.



    5.7 Visual Abnormalities



  Retinal vascular thrombosis has been reported in women receiving estrogens. Discontinue medication pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine. If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions, estrogens should be permanently discontinued.



    5.8 Elevated Blood Pressure



  In a small number of case reports, substantial increases in blood pressure have been attributed to idiosyncratic reactions to estrogens. In a large, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, a generalized effect of estrogen therapy on blood pressure was not seen.



    5.9 Hypertriglyceridemia



  In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Consider discontinuation of treatment if pancreatitis occurs.



    5.10 Hepatic Impairment and/or Past History of Cholestatic Jaundice



  Estrogens may be poorly metabolized in women with impaired liver function. For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued.



 The clearance of drospirenone was decreased in patients with moderate hepatic impairment.



    5.11 Hypothyroidism



  Estrogen administration leads to increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) concentrations. Women with normal thyroid function can compensate for the increased TBG by making more thyroid hormone, thus maintaining free T4and T3serum concentrations in the normal range. Women dependent on thyroid hormone replacement therapy who are also receiving estrogens may require increased doses of their thyroid replacement therapy. These women should have their thyroid function monitored in order to maintain their free thyroid hormone concentrations in an acceptable range.



    5.12 Fluid Retention



  Estrogens and progestins may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women with conditions that might be influenced by this factor, such as a cardiac or renal impairment, warrant careful observation when estrogens are prescribed.



    5.13 Hypocalcemia



  Estrogen therapy should be used with caution in women with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur.



    5.14 Hyponatremia



  As an aldosterone antagonist, drospirenone may increase the possibility of hyponatremia in high-risk patients.



    5.15 Exacerbation of Endometriosis



  Endometriosis may be exacerbated with administration of estrogens.



    5.16 Hereditary Angioedema



  Exogenous estrogens may exacerbate symptoms of angioedema in women with hereditary angioedema.



    5.17 Exacerbation of Other Conditions



  Estrogen therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus otosclerosis, chorea minor and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions. In women with hereditary angioedema exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema.



    5.18 Laboratory Tests



  Serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol concentrations have not been shown to be useful in the management of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms.



    5.19 Interference with Laboratory Tests



  Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet aggregation time; increased platelet count; increased factors II, VII antigen, VIII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX, X, XII, VII-X complex, II-VII-X complex, and beta-thromboglobulin; decreased concentrations of anti-factor Xa and antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity; increased concentrations of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity; increased plasminogen antigen and activity.



 Increased TBG concentrations leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone, as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4concentrations (by column or by radioimmunoassay) or T3concentrations by radioimmunoassay. T3resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T4and free T3concentrations are unaltered. Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone.



 Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum, for example, corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone binding globulin, leading to increased total circulating corticosteroids and sex steroids, respectively. Free hormone concentrations, such as testosterone and estradiol, may be decreased. Other plasma proteins may be increased (angiotensinogen/renin substrate, alpha-l-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin).



 Increased plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and HDL2subfraction concentrations, reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration, increased triglyceride concentrations.



 Impaired glucose tolerance.



 Reduced response to metyrapone test.
