  6.1 Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The safety data described below reflects exposure to DARZALEX (16 mg/kg) in 1166 patients with multiple myeloma including 872 patients from three Phase 3 active-controlled trials who received DARZALEX in combination with either lenalidomide and dexamethasone (DRd, n=283; POLLUX), bortezomib and dexamethasone (DVd, n=243; CASTOR) or bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone (D-VMP, n=346; ALCYONE), and five open-label, clinical trials in which patients received DARZALEX either in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (DPd, n=103; EQUULEUS), in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (n=35), or as monotherapy (n=156).



     Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma  



     Combination Treatment with Bortezomib, Melphalan and Prednisone  



 Adverse reactions described in Table 5 reflect exposure to DARZALEX (D-VMP arm) for a median treatment duration of 14.7 months (range: 0 to 25.8 months) and median treatment duration of 12 months (range: 0.1 to 14.9 months) for the VMP group in ALCYONE. The most frequent adverse reactions (&gt;=20% with at least 5% greater frequency in the D-VMP arm) were infusion reactions, upper respiratory tract infection and edema peripheral. Serious adverse reactions with at least a 2% greater incidence in the D-VMP arm compared to the VMP arm were pneumonia (D-VMP 11% vs VMP 4%), upper respiratory tract infection (D-VMP 5% vs VMP 1%), and pulmonary edema (D-VMP 2% vs VMP 0%).

 The safety data reflect exposure to DARZALEX in 156 adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma treated with DARZALEX at 16 mg/kg in three open-label, clinical trials. The median duration of exposure was 3.3 months (range: 0.03 to 20.04 months). Serious adverse reactions were reported in 51 (33%) patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions were pneumonia (6%), general physical health deterioration (3%), and pyrexia (3%).



 Adverse reactions resulted in treatment delay for 24 (15%) patients, most frequently for infections. Adverse reactions resulted in discontinuations for 6 (4%) patients.



 Adverse reactions occurring in at least 10% of patients are presented in Table 13. Table 14 describes Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities reported at a rate of &gt;=10%.

              Infusion Reactions  
 

 In clinical trials (monotherapy and combination treatments; N=1166) the incidence of any grade infusion reactions was 40% with the first infusion of DARZALEX, 2% with the second infusion, and 4% with subsequent infusions. Less than 1% of patients had a Grade 3 infusion reaction with second or subsequent infusions. Grade 4 infusion reactions were reported in 2/1166 (0.2%) of patients.



 The median time to onset of a reaction was 1.4 hours (range: 0 to 72.8 hours). The incidence of infusion modification due to reactions was 37%. Median durations of infusion for the 1  st  , 2  nd  and subsequent infusions were 7.0, 4.3, and 3.4 hours respectively.



 Severe infusion reactions included bronchospasm, dyspnea, laryngeal edema, pulmonary edema, hypoxia, and hypertension. Other adverse infusion reactions included nasal congestion, cough, chills, throat irritation, vomiting and nausea.



     Herpes Zoster Virus Reactivation  



 Prophylaxis for Herpes Zoster Virus reactivation was recommended for patients in some clinical trials of DARZALEX. In monotherapy studies, herpes zoster was reported in 3% of patients. In the combination therapy studies, herpes zoster was reported in 2-5% of patients receiving DARZALEX.



     Infections  



 In patients receiving DARZALEX combination therapy, Grade 3 or 4 infections were reported with DARZALEX combinations and background therapies (DVd: 21%, Vd: 19%; DRd: 28%, Rd: 23%; D-VMP:23%, VMP:15%; DPd: 28%). Pneumonia was the most commonly reported severe (Grade 3 or 4) infection across studies. Discontinuations from treatment were reported in 3% versus 2% of patients in the DRd and Rd groups respectively, 4% versus 3% of patients in the DVd and Vd groups respectively, 1% each in the D-VMP and VMP groups respectively, and in 5% of patients receiving DPd. Fatal infections were generally balanced between the DARZALEX containing regimens and active control arms (&lt;2%) in the controlled studies and were primarily due to pneumonia and sepsis.



   6.2 Immunogenicity

  As with all therapeutic proteins, there is the potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to daratumumab in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading. In clinical trials of patients with multiple myeloma treated with DARZALEX as monotherapy or as combination therapies, none of the 111 evaluable monotherapy patients, and 2 of the 411 combination therapy patients, tested positive for anti-daratumumab antibodies. One patient administered DARZALEX as combination therapy, developed transient neutralizing antibodies against daratumumab. However, this assay has limitations in detecting anti-daratumumab antibodies in the presence of high concentrations of daratumumab; therefore, the incidence of antibody development might not have been reliably determined.



   6.3 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of DARZALEX. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

</Section>
    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Infusion reactions: Interrupt DARZALEX infusion for infusion reactions of any severity. Permanently discontinue the infusion in case of anaphylactic reactions or life-threatening infusion reactions and institute appropriate emergency care. (  2.1  ,  5.1  ) 
 *  Interference with cross-matching and red blood cell antibody screening: Type and screen patients prior to starting treatment. Inform blood banks that a patient has received DARZALEX. (  5.2  ,  7.1  ) 
 *  Neutropenia: Monitor complete blood cell counts periodically during treatment. Monitor patients with neutropenia for signs of infection. Dose delay may be required to allow recovery of neutrophils. (  5.3  ) 
 *  Thrombocytopenia: Monitor complete blood cell counts periodically during treatment. Dose delay may be required to allow recovery of platelets. (  5.4  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Infusion Reactions



   DARZALEX can cause severe and/or serious infusion reactions including anaphylactic reactions. In clinical trials, approximately half of all patients experienced an infusion reaction. Most infusion reactions occurred during the first infusion and were Grade 1-2 [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .  



 Infusion reactions can also occur with subsequent infusions. Nearly all reactions occurred during infusion or within 4 hours of completing DARZALEX. Prior to the introduction of post-infusion medication in clinical trials, infusion reactions occurred up to 48 hours after infusion.



 Severe reactions have occurred, including bronchospasm, hypoxia, dyspnea, hypertension, laryngeal edema and pulmonary edema. Signs and symptoms may include respiratory symptoms, such as nasal congestion, cough, throat irritation, as well as chills, vomiting and nausea. Less common symptoms were wheezing, allergic rhinitis, pyrexia, chest discomfort, pruritus, and hypotension [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



  Pre-medicate patients with antihistamines, antipyretics and corticosteroids. Frequently monitor patients during the entire infusion. Interrupt DARZALEX infusion for reactions of any severity and institute medical management as needed. Permanently discontinue DARZALEX therapy if an anaphylactic reaction or life-threatening (Grade 4) reaction occurs and institute appropriate emergency care. For patients with Grade 1, 2, or 3 reactions, reduce the infusion rate when re-starting the infusion [see  Dosage and Administration (2.1)  ]  .  



 To reduce the risk of delayed infusion reactions, administer oral corticosteroids to all patients following DARZALEX infusions [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  . Patients with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may require additional post-infusion medications to manage respiratory complications. Consider prescribing short- and long-acting bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.



    5.2 Interference with Serological Testing



  Daratumumab binds to CD38 on red blood cells (RBCs) and results in a positive Indirect Antiglobulin Test (Indirect Coombs test). Daratumumab-mediated positive indirect antiglobulin test may persist for up to 6 months after the last daratumumab infusion. Daratumumab bound to RBCs masks detection of antibodies to minor antigens in the patient's serum [see  References (15)  ]  . The determination of a patient's ABO and Rh blood type are not impacted [see  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ]  .



 Notify blood transfusion centers of this interference with serological testing and inform blood banks that a patient has received DARZALEX. Type and screen patients prior to starting DARZALEX.



    5.3 Neutropenia



  DARZALEX may increase neutropenia induced by background therapy [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  



 Monitor complete blood cell counts periodically during treatment according to manufacturer's prescribing information for background therapies. Monitor patients with neutropenia for signs of infection. DARZALEX dose delay may be required to allow recovery of neutrophils. No dose reduction of DARZALEX is recommended. Consider supportive care with growth factors.



    5.4 Thrombocytopenia



  DARZALEX may increase thrombocytopenia induced by background therapy [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  



 Monitor complete blood cell counts periodically during treatment according to manufacturer's prescribing information for background therapies. DARZALEX dose delay may be required to allow recovery of platelets. No dose reduction of DARZALEX is recommended. Consider supportive care with transfusions.



    5.5 Interference with Determination of Complete Response



  Daratumumab is a human IgG kappa monoclonal antibody that can be detected on both, the serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) and immunofixation (IFE) assays used for the clinical monitoring of endogenous M-protein [see  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ]  . This interference can impact the determination of complete response and of disease progression in some patients with IgG kappa myeloma protein.
