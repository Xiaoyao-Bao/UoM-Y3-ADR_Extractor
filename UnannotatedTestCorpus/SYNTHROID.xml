  Adverse Reactions in Children

  Pseudotumor cerebri and slipped capital femoral epiphysis have been reported in children receiving levothyroxine therapy. Overtreatment may result in craniosynostosis in infants and premature closure of the epiphyses in children with resultant compromised adult height.



   Hypersensitivity Reactions

  Hypersensitivity reactions to inactive ingredients have occurred in patients treated with thyroid hormone products. These include urticaria, pruritus, skin rash, flushing, angioedema, various gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea), fever, arthralgia, serum sickness, and wheezing. Hypersensitivity to levothyroxine itself is not known to occur.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: NOT FOR TREATMENT OF OBESITY OR FOR WEIGHT LOSS

  WARNING: NOT FOR TREATMENT OF OBESITY OR FOR WEIGHT LOSS

    *  Thyroid hormones, including SYNTHROID, either alone or with other therapeutic agents, should not be used for the treatment of obesity or for weight loss. 
 *  In euthyroid patients, doses within the range of daily hormonal requirements are ineffective for weight reduction. 
 *  Larger doses may produce serious or even life threatening manifestations of toxicity, particularly when given in association with sympathomimetic amines such as those used for their anorectic effects [see Adverse Reactions (6), Drug Interactions (7.7), and Overdosage (10)]. 
      EXCERPT:     WARNING: NOT FOR TREATMENT OF OBESITY OR FOR WEIGHT LOSS  
 

     See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning    



 *  Thyroid hormones, including SYNTHROID should not be used for the treatment of obesity or for weight loss. 
 *  Doses beyond the range of daily hormonal requirements may produce serious or even life threatening manifestations of toxicity (6, 10).

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *   Cardiac adverse reactions in the elderly and in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease: Initiate SYNTHROID at less than the full replacement dose because of the increased risk of cardiac adverse reactions, including atrial fibrillation.  (2.3  ,  5.1  ,  8.5)   
 *   Myxedema coma: Do not use oral thyroid hormone drug products to treat myxedema coma.  (5.2)   
 *   Acute adrenal crisis in patients with concomitant adrenal insufficiency: Treat with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiation of SYNTHROID treatment.  (5.3)   
 *   Prevention of hyperthyroidism or incomplete treatment of hypothyroidism: Proper dose titration and careful monitoring is critical to prevent the persistence of hypothyroidism or the development of hyperthyroidism.  (5.4)   
 *   Worsening of diabetic control: Therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing thyroid hormone therapy.  (5.5)   
 *   Decreased bone mineral density associated with thyroid hormone over-replacement: Over-replacement can increase bone resorption and decrease bone mineral density. Give the lowest effective dose.  (5.6)   
    
 

   5.1 Cardiac Adverse Reactions in the Elderly and in Patients with Underlying Cardiovascular Disease



  Over-treatment with levothyroxine may cause an increase in heart rate, cardiac wall thickness, and cardiac contractility and may precipitate angina or arrhythmias, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease and in elderly patients. Initiate SYNTHROID therapy in this population at lower doses than those recommended in younger individuals or in patients without cardiac disease [see Dosage and Administration  (2.3)  , Use in Specific Populations  (8.5)  ]  .



 Monitor for cardiac arrhythmias during surgical procedures in patients with coronary artery disease receiving suppressive SYNTHROID therapy. Monitor patients receiving concomitant SYNTHROID and sympathomimetic agents for signs and symptoms of coronary insufficiency.



 If cardiac symptoms develop or worsen, reduce the SYNTHROID dose or withhold for one week and restart at a lower dose.



    5.2 Myxedema Coma



  Myxedema coma is a life-threatening emergency characterized by poor circulation and hypometabolism, and may result in unpredictable absorption of levothyroxine sodium from the gastrointestinal tract. Use of oral thyroid hormone drug products is not recommended to treat myxedema coma. Administer thyroid hormone products formulated for intravenous administration to treat myxedema coma.



    5.3 Acute Adrenal Crisis in Patients with Concomitant Adrenal Insufficiency



  Thyroid hormone increases metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids. Initiation of thyroid hormone therapy prior to initiating glucocorticoid therapy may precipitate an acute adrenal crisis in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Treat patients with adrenal insufficiency with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiating treatment with SYNTHROID [see Contraindications  (4)  ]  .



    5.4 Prevention of Hyperthyroidism or Incomplete Treatment of Hypothyroidism



  SYNTHROID has a narrow therapeutic index. Over- or undertreatment with SYNTHROID may have negative effects on growth and development, cardiovascular function, bone metabolism, reproductive function, cognitive function, emotional state, gastrointestinal function, and glucose and lipid metabolism. Titrate the dose of SYNTHROID carefully and monitor response to titration to avoid these effects [see Dosage and Administration  (2.4)  ]  . Monitor for the presence of drug or food interactions when using SYNTHROID and adjust the dose as necessary [see Drug Interactions  (7.9)  and Clinical Pharmacology  (12.3)  ]  .



    5.5 Worsening of Diabetic Control



  Addition of levothyroxine therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing SYNTHROID [see Drug Interactions  (7.2)  ]  .



    5.6 Decreased Bone Mineral Density Associated with Thyroid Hormone Over-Replacement



  Increased bone resorption and decreased bone mineral density may occur as a result of levothyroxine over-replacement, particularly in post-menopausal women. The increased bone resorption may be associated with increased serum levels and urinary excretion of calcium and phosphorous, elevations in bone alkaline phosphatase, and suppressed serum parathyroid hormone levels. Administer the minimum dose of SYNTHROID that achieves the desired clinical and biochemical response to mitigate this risk.



       7 DRUG INTERACTIONS



  EXCERPT:   See full prescribing information for drugs that affect thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics and metabolism (e.g., absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to SYNTHROID.  (7)  



 



   7.1 Drugs Known to Affect Thyroid Hormone Pharmacokinetics



  Many drugs can exert effects on thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics and metabolism (e.g., absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to SYNTHROID (see Tables 2-5 below).



 Table 2. Drugs That May Decrease T4 Absorption (Hypothyroidism) 
 Potential impact: Concurrent use may reduce the efficacy of SYNTHROID by binding and delaying or preventing absorption, potentially resulting in hypothyroidism.   
  Drug or Drug Class     Effect           
 Calcium CarbonateFerrous Sulfate  Calcium carbonate may form an insoluble chelate with levothyroxine, and ferrous sulfate likely forms a ferric-thyroxine complex. Administer SYNTHROID at least 4 hours apart from these agents.   
 Orlistat         Monitor patients treated concomitantly with orlistat and SYNTHROID for changes in thyroid function.   
 Bile Acid Sequestrants- Colesevelam- Cholestyramine- ColestipolIon Exchange Resins- Kayexalate- Sevelamer  Bile acid sequestrants and ion exchange resins are known to decrease levothyroxine absorption. Administer SYNTHROID at least 4 hours prior to these drugs or monitor TSH levels.   
 Other drugs:Proton Pump InhibitorsSucralfateAntacids- Aluminum &amp; Magnesium Hydroxides- Simethicone  Gastric acidity is an essential requirement for adequate absorption of levothyroxine. Sucralfate, antacids and proton pump inhibitors may cause hypochlorhydria, affect intragastric pH, and reduce levothyroxine absorption. Monitor patients appropriately.   
     Table 3. Drugs That May Alter T4 and Triiodothyronine (T3) Serum Transport Without Affecting Free Thyroxine (FT4) Concentration (Euthyroidism) 
  Drug or Drug Class     Effect           
 ClofibrateEstrogen-containing oral contraceptivesEstrogens (oral)Heroin / Methadone5-FluorouracilMitotaneTamoxifen  These drugs may increase serum thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) concentration.   
 Androgens / Anabolic SteroidsAsparaginaseGlucocorticoidsSlow-Release Nicotinic Acid  These drugs may decrease serum TBG concentration.   
 Potential impact (below): Administration of these agents with SYNTHROID results in an initial transient increase in FT4. Continued administration results in a decrease in serum T4 and normal FT4 and TSH concentrations.   
 Salicylates (&gt; 2 g/day)  Salicylates inhibit binding of T4 and T3 to TBG and transthyretin. An initial increase in serum FT4 is followed by return of FT4 to normal levels with sustained therapeutic serum salicylate concentrations, although total T4 levels may decrease by as much as 30%.   
 Other drugs:CarbamazepineFurosemide (&gt; 80 mg IV)HeparinHydantoinsNon-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs- Fenamates  These drugs may cause protein-binding site displacement. Furosemide has been shown to inhibit the protein binding of T4 to TBG and albumin, causing an increase free T4 fraction in serum. Furosemide competes for T4-binding sites on TBG, prealbumin, and albumin, so that a single high dose can acutely lower the total T4 level. Phenytoin and carbamazepine reduce serum protein binding of levothyroxine, and total and free T4 may be reduced by 20% to 40%, but most patients have normal serum TSH levels and are clinically euthyroid. Closely monitor thyroid hormone parameters.   
     Table 4. Drugs That May Alter Hepatic Metabolism of T4 (Hypothyroidism) 
 Potential impact: Stimulation of hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing enzyme activity may cause increased hepatic degradation of levothyroxine, resulting in increased SYNTHROID requirements.   
  Drug or Drug Class     Effect           
 PhenobarbitalRifampin  Phenobarbital has been shown to reduce the response to thyroxine. Phenobarbital increases L-thyroxine metabolism by inducing uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and leads to a lower T4 serum levels. Changes in thyroid status may occur if barbiturates are added or withdrawn from patients being treated for hypothyroidism. Rifampin has been shown to accelerate the metabolism of levothyroxine.   
     Table 5. Drugs That May Decrease Conversion of T4 to T3 
 Potential impact: Administration of these enzyme inhibitors decreases the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, leading to decreased T3 levels. However, serum T4 levels are usually normal but may occasionally be slightly increased.   
  Drug or Drug Class     Effect           
 Beta-adrenergic antagonists(e.g., Propranolol &gt; 160 mg/day)  In patients treated with large doses of propranolol (&gt; 160 mg/day), T3 and T4 levels change, TSH levels remain normal, and patients are clinically euthyroid. Actions of particular beta-adrenergic antagonists may be impaired when a hypothyroid patient is converted to the euthyroid state.   
 Glucocorticoids(e.g., Dexamethasone &gt;  4 mg/day)  Short-term administration of large doses of glucocorticoids may decrease serum T3 concentrations by 30% with minimal change in serum T4 levels. However, long-term glucocorticoid therapy may result in slightly decreased T3 and T4 levels due to decreased TBG production (See above).   
 Other drugs:Amiodarone  Amiodarone inhibits peripheral conversion of levothyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) and may cause isolated biochemical changes (increase in serum free-T4, and decreased or normal free-T3) in clinically euthyroid patients.   
         7.2 Antidiabetic Therapy
 

  Addition of SYNTHROID therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control, especially when thyroid therapy is started, changed, or discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions  (5.5)  ]  .



    7.3 Oral Anticoagulants



  SYNTHROID increases the response to oral anticoagulant therapy. Therefore, a decrease in the dose of anticoagulant may be warranted with correction of the hypothyroid state or when the SYNTHROID dose is increased. Closely monitor coagulation tests to permit appropriate and timely dosage adjustments.



    7.4 Digitalis Glycosides



  SYNTHROID may reduce the therapeutic effects of digitalis glycosides. Serum digitalis glycoside levels may decrease when a hypothyroid patient becomes euthyroid, necessitating an increase in the dose of digitalis glycosides.



    7.5 Antidepressant Therapy



  Concurrent use of tricyclic (e.g., amitriptyline) or tetracyclic (e.g., maprotiline) antidepressants and SYNTHROID may increase the therapeutic and toxic effects of both drugs, possibly due to increased receptor sensitivity to catecholamines. Toxic effects may include increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and central nervous system stimulation. SYNTHROID may accelerate the onset of action of tricyclics. Administration of sertraline in patients stabilized on SYNTHROID may result in increased SYNTHROID requirements.



    7.6 Ketamine



  Concurrent use of ketamine and SYNTHROID may produce marked hypertension and tachycardia. Closely monitor blood pressure and heart rate in these patients.



    7.7 Sympathomimetics



  Concurrent use of sympathomimetics and SYNTHROID may increase the effects of sympathomimetics or thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormones may increase the risk of coronary insufficiency when sympathomimetic agents are administered to patients with coronary artery disease.



    7.8 Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitors



  Concurrent use of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors such as imatinib may cause hypothyroidism. Closely monitor TSH levels in such patients.



    7.9 Drug-Food Interactions



  Consumption of certain foods may affect SYNTHROID absorption thereby necessitating adjustments in dosing [see Dosage and Administration  (2.1)  ]  . Soybean flour, cottonseed meal, walnuts, and dietary fiber may bind and decrease the absorption of SYNTHROID from the gastrointestinal tract. Grapefruit juice may delay the absorption of levothyroxine and reduce its bioavailability.



    7.10 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions



  Consider changes in TBG concentration when interpreting T4 and T3 values. Measure and evaluate unbound (free) hormone and/or determine the free-T4 index (FT4I) in this circumstance. Pregnancy, infectious hepatitis, estrogens, estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, and acute intermittent porphyria increase TBG concentration. Nephrosis, severe hypoproteinemia, severe liver disease, acromegaly, androgens, and corticosteroids decrease TBG concentration. Familial hyper- or hypo-thyroxine binding globulinemias have been described, with the incidence of TBG deficiency approximating 1 in 9000.
