  Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



   TERAZOL  (r)  7 (terconazole) Vaginal Cream 0.4%

  During controlled clinical studies conducted in the United States, 521 patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis were treated with terconazole 0.4% vaginal cream. Based on comparative analyses with placebo, the adverse experiences considered most likely related to terconazole 0.4% vaginal cream were headache (26% vs. 17% with placebo) and body pain (2.1% vs. 0% with placebo). Fever (1.7% vs. 0.5% with placebo) and chills (0.4% vs. 0.0% with placebo), vulvovaginal burning, itching and irritation have also been reported. The adverse drug experience on terconazole most frequently causing discontinuation was vulvovaginal itching.



   TERAZOL  (r)  3 (terconazole) Vaginal Cream 0.8%

  During controlled clinical studies conducted in the United States, patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis were treated with terconazole 0.8% vaginal cream for three days. Based on comparative analyses with placebo and a standard agent, the adverse experiences considered most likely related to terconazole 0.8% vaginal cream were headache (21% vs. 16% with placebo) and dysmenorrhea (6% vs. 2% with placebo). Other adverse experiences reported with terconazole 0.8% vaginal cream were abdominal pain (3.4% vs. 1% with placebo) and fever (1% vs. 0.3% with placebo). The adverse drug experience most frequently causing discontinuation of therapy was vulvovaginal itching, 0.7% with the terconazole 0.8% vaginal cream group and 0.3% with the placebo group.



   TERAZOL  (r)  3 (terconazole) Vaginal Suppositories 80 mg

  During controlled clinical studies conducted in the United States, 284 patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis were treated with terconazole 80 mg vaginal suppositories. Based on comparative analyses with placebo (295 patients), the adverse experiences considered adverse reactions most likely related to terconazole 80 mg vaginal suppositories were headache (30.3% vs. 20.7% with placebo) and pain of the female genitalia (4.2% vs. 0.7% with placebo). Adverse reactions that have also been reported but were not statistically significantly different from placebo were burning (15.2% vs. 11.2% with placebo) and body pain (3.9% vs. 1.7% with placebo). Fever (2.8% vs. 1.4% with placebo) and chills (1.8% vs. 0.7% with placebo) have also been reported. The adverse drug experience on terconazole most frequently causing discontinuation was burning (2.5% vs. 1.4% with placebo) and pruritus (1.8% vs. 1.4% with placebo).



   Post-marketing Experience

  The following adverse drug reactions have been first identified during post-marketing experience with TERAZOL  (r)  . Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 General: Asthenia, Influenza-Like Illness consisting of multiple listed reactions including fever and chills, nausea, vomiting, myalgia, arthralgia, malaise



 Immune: Hypersensitivity, Anaphylaxis, Face Edema



 Nervous: Dizziness



 Respiratory: Bronchospasm



 Skin: Rash, Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis, Urticaria

   General



  For vulvovaginal use only. TERAZOL  (r)  is not for ophthalmic or oral use. Discontinue use and do not retreat with terconazole if sensitization, irritation, fever, chills or flu-like symptoms are reported during use.



 The base contained in the suppository formulation may interact with certain rubber or latex products, such as those used in vaginal contraceptive diaphragms or latex condoms; therefore concurrent use is not recommended.



    Laboratory Tests



  If there is lack of response to terconazole, appropriate microbiologic studies (standard KOH smear and/or cultures) should be repeated to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other pathogens.



    Drug Interactions



  The therapeutic effect of terconazole is not affected by oral contraceptive usage.



 The levels of estradiol and progesterone did not differ significantly when 0.8% terconazole vaginal cream was administered to healthy female volunteers established on a low dose oral contraceptive.



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility



   Carcinogenesis



  Studies to determine the carcinogenic potential of terconazole have not been performed.



    Mutagenicity



  Terconazole was not mutagenic when tested in vitro  for induction of microbial point mutations (Ames test), or for inducing cellular transformation, or in vivo  for chromosome breaks (micronucleus test) or dominant lethal mutations in mouse germ cells.



    Impairment of Fertility



  No impairment of fertility occurred when female rats were administered terconazole orally up to 40 mg/kg/day for a three month period.



    Pregnancy



   Teratogenic Effects



  There was no evidence of teratogenicity when terconazole was administered orally up to 40 mg/kg/day (25* the recommended intravaginal human dose of the suppository formulation, 50* the recommended intravaginal human dose of the 0.8% vaginal cream formulation, and 100* the intravaginal human dose of the 0.4% vaginal cream formulation) in rats, or 20 mg/kg/day in rabbits, or subcutaneously up to 20 mg/kg/day in rats.



 Dosages at or below 10 mg/kg/day produced no embryotoxicity; however, there was a delay in fetal ossification at 10 mg/kg/day in rats. There was some evidence of embryotoxicity in rabbits and rats at 20-40 mg/kg. In rats, this was reflected as a decrease in litter size and number of viable young and reduced fetal weight. There was also delay in ossification and an increased incidence of skeletal variants.



 The no-effect dose of 10 mg/kg/day resulted in a mean peak plasma level of terconazole in pregnant rats of 0.176 mcg/mL which exceeds by 44 times the mean peak plasma level (0.004 mcg/mL) seen in normal subjects after intravaginal administration of terconazole 0.4% vaginal cream, by 30 times the mean peak plasma level (0.006 mcg/mL) seen in normal subjects after intravaginal administration of terconazole 0.8% vaginal cream, and by 17 times the mean peak plasma level (0.010 mcg/mL) seen in normal subjects after intravaginal administration of terconazole 80 mg vaginal suppository. This safety assessment does not account for possible exposure of the fetus through direct transfer to terconazole from the irritated vagina by diffusion across amniotic membranes.



 Since terconazole is absorbed from the human vagina, it should not be used in the first trimester of pregnancy unless the physician considers it essential to the welfare of the patient.



 Terconazole may be used during the second and third trimester if the potential benefit outweighs the possible risks to the fetus.



    Nursing Mothers



  It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Animal studies have shown that rat offspring exposed via the milk of treated (40 mg/kg/orally) dams showed decreased survival during the first few post-partum days, but overall pup weight and weight gain were comparable to or greater than controls throughout lactation. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for adverse reaction in nursing infants from terconazole, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.



    Pediatric Use



  Safety and efficacy in children have not been established.



    Geriatric Use



  Clinical studies of TERAZOL  (r)  did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.

  Anaphylaxis and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported during terconazole therapy. TERAZOL  (r)  therapy should be discontinued if anaphylaxis or toxic epidermal necrolysis develops.
