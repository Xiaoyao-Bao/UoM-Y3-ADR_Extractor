  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

 The data provided reflect the experience with the use of Mirena in the adequate and well-controlled studies as well as in the supportive and uncontrolled studies for contraception and heavy menstrual bleeding (n=5,091). The data cover more than 12,101 women-years of exposure, mainly in the contraception studies (11,761 women-years). The frequencies of reported adverse drug reactions represent crude incidences.

 The most common adverse reactions (&gt;=10% users) are alterations of menstrual bleeding patterns [including unscheduled uterine bleeding (31.9%), decreased uterine bleeding (23.4%), increased scheduled uterine bleeding (11.9%), and female genital tract bleeding (3.5%)], abdominal/pelvic pain (22.6%), amenorrhea (18.4%), headache/migraine (16.3%), genital discharge (14.9%), and vulvovaginitis (10.5%). Adverse reactions reported in &gt;= 5% of users are shown in Table 1.

   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Mirena. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

 *    Arterial thrombotic and venous thromboembolic events, including cases of pulmonary emboli, deep vein thrombosis and stroke 
 *    Device breakage 
 *    Hypersensitivity (including rash, urticaria and angioedema) 
 *    Increased blood pressure

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">   5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

   EXCERPT:    *    Remove Mirena if pregnancy occurs with Mirena in place. If pregnancy occurs, there is increased risk of ectopic pregnancy including loss of fertility, pregnancy loss, septic abortion (including septicemia, shock and death), and premature labor and delivery. (  5.1  ,  5.2  ) 
 *    Group A streptococcal infection has been reported; strict aseptic technique is essential during insertion. (  5.3  ) 
 *    Before using Mirena, consider the risks of PID. (  5.4  ) 
 *    Bleeding patterns become altered, may remain irregular and amenorrhea may ensue. (  5.5  ) 
 *    Perforation may occur and may reduce contraceptive effectiveness. Risk is increased if inserted in lactating women and may be increased if inserted in women with fixed retroverted uteri and postpartum. (  5.6  ) 
 *    Partial or complete expulsion may occur. (  5.7  ) 
 *    Evaluate persistent enlarged ovarian follicles or ovarian cysts. (  5.8  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Ectopic Pregnancy

  Evaluate women for ectopic pregnancy if they become pregnant with Mirena in place because the likelihood of a pregnancy being ectopic is increased with Mirena. Up to half of pregnancies that occur with Mirena in place are likely to be ectopic. Also consider the possibility of ectopic pregnancy in the case of lower abdominal pain, especially in association with missed periods or if an amenorrheic woman starts bleeding.

 The incidence of ectopic pregnancy in clinical trials with Mirena, which excluded women with a history of ectopic pregnancy, was approximately 0.1% per year. The risk of ectopic pregnancy, in women who have a history of ectopic pregnancy and use Mirena is unknown. Women with a previous history of ectopic pregnancy, tubal surgery or pelvic infection carry a higher risk of ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancy may result in loss of fertility.

    5.2 Intrauterine Pregnancy

  If pregnancy occurs while using Mirena, remove Mirena because leaving it in place may increase the risk of spontaneous abortion and preterm labor. Removal of Mirena or probing of the uterus may also result in spontaneous abortion. In the event of an intrauterine pregnancy with Mirena, consider the following:

     Septic abortion  

  In patients becoming pregnant with an IUD in place, septic abortion - with septicemia, septic shock, and death - may occur.

     Continuation of pregnancy  

  If a woman becomes pregnant with Mirena in place and if Mirena cannot be removed or the woman chooses not to have it removed, warn her that failure to remove Mirena increases the risk of miscarriage, sepsis, premature labor and premature delivery. Follow her pregnancy closely and advise her to report immediately any symptom that suggests complications of the pregnancy.

     Long-term effects and congenital anomalies  

  When pregnancy continues with Mirena in place, long-term effects on the offspring are unknown. Congenital anomalies in live births have occurred infrequently. No clear trend towards specific anomalies has been observed. Because of the local exposure of the fetus to LNG, the possibility of teratogenicity following exposure to Mirena cannot be completely excluded. Some observational data support a small increased risk of masculinization of the external genitalia of the female fetus following exposure to progestins at doses greater than those currently used for oral contraception. Whether these data apply to Mirena is unknown.

    5.3 Sepsis

  Severe infection or sepsis, including Group A streptococcal sepsis (GAS), have been reported following insertion of Mirena. In some cases, severe pain occurred within hours of insertion followed by sepsis within days. Because death from GAS is more likely if treatment is delayed, it is important to be aware of these rare but serious infections. Aseptic technique during insertion of Mirena is essential in order to minimize serious infections such as GAS.

    5.4 Pelvic Infection

    Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)  

  Mirena is contraindicated in the presence of known or suspected PID or in women with a history of PID unless there has been a subsequent intrauterine pregnancy [see Contraindications (     4  )].  IUDs have been associated with an increased risk of PID, most likely due to organisms being introduced into the uterus during insertion. In clinical trials, total combined upper genital infections were reported in 3.5% of Mirena users. More specifically, endometritis was reported in 2.1%, PID in 0.6%, and all other upper genital infections in &lt;=0.5% of women overall. These infections occurred more frequently within the first year. In a clinical trial with other IUDs  1  and a clinical trial with an IUD similar to Mirena, the highest rate occurred within the first month after insertion.

 Promptly examine users with complaints of lower abdominal or pelvic pain, odorous discharge, unexplained bleeding, fever, genital lesions or sores. Remove Mirena in cases of recurrent endometritis or PID, or if an acute pelvic infection is severe or does not respond to treatment.

    Women at increased risk for PID

  PID is often associated with a sexually transmitted infection, and Mirena does not protect against sexually transmitted infection. The risk of PID is greater for women who have multiple sexual partners, and also for women whose sexual partner(s) have multiple sexual partners. Women who have had PID are at increased risk for a recurrence or re-infection. In particular, ascertain whether the woman is at increased risk of infection (for example, leukemia, acquired immune deficiency syndrome [AIDS], IV drug abuse).

    Asymptomatic PID

  PID may be asymptomatic but still result in tubal damage and its sequelae.

    Treatment of PID

  Following a diagnosis of PID, or suspected PID, bacteriologic specimens should be obtained and antibiotic therapy should be initiated promptly. Removal of Mirena after initiation of antibiotic therapy is usually appropriate. Guidelines for PID treatment are available from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Atlanta, Georgia.

    Actinomycosis

  Actinomycosis has been associated with IUDs. Symptomatic women should have Mirena removed and should receive antibiotics. The significance of actinomyces-like organisms on Pap smear in an asymptomatic IUD user is unknown, and so this finding alone does not always require Mirena removal and treatment. When possible, confirm a Pap smear diagnosis with cultures.

    5.5 Irregular Bleeding and Amenorrhea

  Mirena can alter the bleeding pattern and result in spotting, irregular bleeding, heavy bleeding, oligomenorrhea and amenorrhea. During the first three to six months of Mirena use, the number of bleeding and spotting days may be increased and bleeding patterns may be irregular. Thereafter the number of bleeding and spotting days usually decreases but bleeding may remain irregular. If bleeding irregularities develop during prolonged treatment, appropriate diagnostic measures should be taken to rule out endometrial pathology.

 Amenorrhea develops in approximately 20% of Mirena users by one year. The possibility of pregnancy should be considered if menstruation does not occur within six weeks of the onset of previous menstruation. Once pregnancy has been excluded, repeated pregnancy tests are generally not necessary in amenorrheic women unless indicated, for example, by other signs of pregnancy or by pelvic pain [see Clinical Studies (     14.1  )].  

 In most women with heavy menstrual bleeding, the number of bleeding and spotting days may also increase during the initial months of therapy but usually decrease with continued use; the volume of blood loss per cycle progressively becomes reduced [see Clinical Studies (     14.2  )].  

    5.6 Perforation

  Perforation (total or partial, including penetration/embedment of Mirena in the uterine wall or cervix) may occur most often during insertion, although the perforation may not be detected until sometime later. Perforation may reduce contraceptive efficacy and result in pregnancy. The incidence of perforation during clinical trials, which excluded breast-feeding women, was &lt; 0.1%.

 If perforation occurs, locate and remove Mirena. Surgery may be required. Delayed detection or removal of Mirena in case of perforation may result in migration outside the uterine cavity, adhesions, peritonitis, intestinal perforations, intestinal obstruction, abscesses and erosion of adjacent viscera.

 The risk of perforation may be increased if Mirena is inserted when the uterus is fixed retroverted or not completely involuted. Delay Mirena insertion a minimum of six weeks or until involution is complete following a delivery or a second trimester abortion.

 A large postmarketing safety study conducted in Europe over a 1-year observational period reported that lactation at the time of insertion of an IUD/IUS was associated with an increased risk of perforation. For Mirena users, the incidence of uterine perforation was reported as 6.3 per 1,000 insertions for lactating women, compared to 1.0 per 1,000 insertions for non-lactating women.

    5.7 Expulsion

  Partial or complete expulsion of Mirena may occur resulting in the loss of contraceptive protection. Expulsion may be associated with symptoms of bleeding or pain, or it may be asymptomatic and go unnoticed. Mirena typically decreases menstrual bleeding over time; therefore, an increase of menstrual bleeding may be indicative of an expulsion. The risk of expulsion may be increased when the uterus is not completely involuted. In clinical trials, a 4.5% expulsion rate was reported over the 5-year study duration.

 Delay Mirena insertion a minimum of six weeks or until uterine involution is complete following a delivery or a second trimester abortion. Remove a partially expelled Mirena. If expulsion has occurred, a new Mirena can be inserted any time the provider can be reasonably certain the woman is not pregnant..

    5.8 Ovarian Cysts

  Because the contraceptive effect of Mirena is mainly due to its local effects within the uterus, ovulatory cycles with follicular rupture usually occur in women of fertile age using Mirena. Sometime atresia of the follicle is delayed and the follicle may continue to grow. Ovarian cysts have been reported in approximately 8% of women using Mirena. Most of these cysts are asymptomatic, although some may be accompanied by pelvic pain or dyspareunia.

 In most cases the ovarian cysts disappear spontaneously during two to three months observation. Evaluate persistent ovarian cysts. Surgical intervention is not usually required.

    5.9 Breast Cancer

  Women who currently have or have had breast cancer, or have a suspicion of breast cancer, should not use hormonal contraception because some breast cancers are hormone-sensitive [see Contraindications (     4  )].  

 Spontaneous reports of breast cancer have been received during postmarketing experience with Mirena. Observational studies of the risk of breast cancer with use of a LNG-releasing IUS do not provide conclusive evidence of increased risk.

    5.10 Clinical Considerations for Use and Removal

  Use Mirena with caution after careful assessment if any of the following conditions exist, and consider removal of the system if any of them arise during use:

 *    Coagulopathy or use of anticoagulants 
 *    Migraine, focal migraine with asymmetrical visual loss or other symptoms indicating transient cerebral ischemia 
 *    Exceptionally severe headache 
 *    Marked increase of blood pressure 
 *    Severe arterial disease such as stroke or myocardial infarction 
    In addition, consider removing Mirena if any of the following conditions arise during use [see Contraindications (     4  )]  :
 

 *    Uterine or cervical malignancy 
 *    Jaundice 
    If the threads are not visible or are significantly shortened they may have broken or retracted into the cervical canal or uterus. Consider the possibility that the system may have been displaced (for example, expelled or perforated the uterus) [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.6  ,  5.7  )].  Exclude pregnancy and verify the location of Mirena, for example, by sonography, X-ray, or by gentle exploration of the cervical canal with a suitable instrument. If Mirena is displaced, remove it. A new Mirena may be inserted at that time or during the next menses if it is certain that conception has not occurred. If Mirena is in place with no evidence of perforation, no intervention is indicated.
