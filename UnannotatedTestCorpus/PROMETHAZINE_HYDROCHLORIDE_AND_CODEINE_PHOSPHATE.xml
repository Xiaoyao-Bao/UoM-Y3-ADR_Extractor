    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: ULTRA-RAPID METABOLISM OF CODEINE AND OTHER RISK FACTORS FOR LIFE-THREATENING RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION IN CHILDREN and RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH BENZODIAZEPINES OR OTHER CNS DEPRESSANTS 

  WARNING: ULTRA-RAPID METABOLISM OF CODEINE AND OTHER RISK FACTORS FOR LIFE-THREATENING RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION IN CHILDREN and RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH BENZODIAZEPINES OR OTHER CNS DEPRESSANTS 

      Ultra-Rapid Metabolism of Codeine and Other Risk Factors for Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Children    



   Life-threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received codeine. Most of the reported cases occurred following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy, and many of the children had evidence of being an ultra-rapid metabolizer of codeine due to a CYP2D6 polymorphism. Promethazine HCl and codeine phosphate syrup is contraindicated in children younger than 12 years of age and in children younger than 18 years of age following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy (see   CONTRAINDICATIONS  ). Avoid the use of promethazine HCl and codeine phosphate syrup in adolescents 12 to 18 years of age who have other risk factors that may increase their sensitivity to the respiratory depressant effects of codeine. (See   WARNINGS-Ultra-Rapid Metabolism of Codeine and Respiratory Depression  ).  



     Promethazine and Respiratory Depression in Children    



   Postmarketing cases of respiratory depression, including fatalities have been reported with use of promethazine in pediatric patients. Children may be particularly sensitive to the additive respiratory depressant effects when promethazine is combined with other respiratory depressants, including codeine. (See   WARNINGS-Promethazine and Respiratory Depression in Children  ).  



     Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants    



   Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death (see   WARNINGS  ,   PRECAUTIONS-Drug Interactions  ). Avoid use of opioid cough medications in patients taking benzodiazepines, other CNS depressants, or alcohol.  
</Section>
    <Section id="S3" name="precautions">    PRECAUTIONS



   General



  Narcotic analgesics, including codeine, should be administered with caution and the initial dose reduced in patients with acute abdominal conditions, convulsive disorders, significant hepatic or renal impairment, fever, hypothyroidism, Addison's disease, ulcerative colitis, prostatic hypertrophy, in patients with recent gastrointestinal or urinary tract surgery, and in the very young or elderly or debilitated patients.



 Promethazine should be used cautiously in persons with impairment of liver function.



    Anticholinergic Effects



  Drugs having anticholinergic properties should be used with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, stenosing peptic ulcer, pyloroduodenal obstruction, and bladder-neck obstruction.



    Information for Patients



  Advise patients of the risks of respiratory depression and death with promethazine HCl and codeine phosphate syrup in children younger than 18 years of age. Advise patients that promethazine HCl and codeine phosphate syrup should not be used in children younger than 12 years of age or in a child younger than 18 years of age for treatment after tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy. Advise caregivers of children ages 12 to 18 receiving promethazine HCl and codeine phosphate syrup to monitor for signs of respiratory depression. (See   WARNINGS-Ultra-Rapid Metabolism of Codeine and Respiratory Depression    ).



 Advise women that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with promethazine HCl and codeine phosphate syrup. (See   WARNINGS-Ultra-Rapid Metabolism of Codeine and Respiratory Depression    ).



 Promethazine and codeine may cause marked drowsiness or may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery. Ambulatory patients should be told to avoid engaging in such activities until it is known that they do not become drowsy or dizzy from promethazine and codeine therapy. Pediatric patients should be supervised to avoid potential harm in bike riding or in other hazardous activities.



 Inform patients and caregivers that potentially fatal additive effects may occur if promethazine HCl and codeine phosphate syrup is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol. Because of this risk, patients should avoid concomitant use of promethazine HCl and codeine phosphate syrup with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol. (See   WARNINGS-Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants    ).



 Patients should be advised to measure promethazine HCl and codeine phosphate syrup with an accurate measuring device. A household teaspoon is not an accurate measuring device and could lead to overdosage, especially when a half a teaspoon is measured. A pharmacist can recommend an appropriate measuring device and can provide instructions for measuring the correct dose.



 Patients should be advised to report any involuntary muscle movements.



 Avoid prolonged exposure to the sun.



 Codeine, like other narcotic analgesics, may produce orthostatic hypotension in some ambulatory patients. Patients should be cautioned accordingly.



    Drug Interactions



   Codeine  



 In patients receiving MAO inhibitors, an initial small test dose is advisable to allow observation of any excessive narcotic effects or MAOI interaction.



 The use of benzodiazepines, opioids, antihistamines, antipsychotics, anti-anxiety agents, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) concomitantly with promethazine HCl and codeine phosphate syrup may cause an additive CNS depressant effect, profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death and should be avoided. (See   WARNINGS-Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants    ).



  Promethazine  



  Epinephrine:  Because of the potential for promethazine to reverse epinephrine's vasopressor effect, epinephrine should NOT be used to treat hypotension associated with promethazine overdose.



  Anticholinergics:  Concomitant use of other agents with anticholinergic properties should be undertaken with caution.



  Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOI):  Drug interactions, including an increased incidence of extrapyramidal effects, have been reported when some MAOI and phenothiazines are used concomitantly.



    Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions



  Because narcotic analgesics may increase biliary tract pressure, with resultant increase in plasma amylase or lipase levels, determination of these enzyme levels may be unreliable for 24 hours after a narcotic analgesic has been given.



 The following laboratory tests may be affected in patients who are receiving therapy with promethazine hydrochloride:



  Pregnancy Tests:  Diagnostic pregnancy tests based on immunological reactions between HCG and anti-HCG may result in false-negative or false-positive interpretations.



  Glucose Tolerance Test:  An increase in blood glucose has been reported in patients receiving promethazine.



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility



  Long-term animal studies have not been performed to assess the carcinogenic potential of codeine or of promethazine, nor are there other animal or human data concerning carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, or impairment of fertility with these agents. Codeine has been reported to show no evidence of carcinogenicity or mutagenicity in a variety of test systems, including the micronucleus and sperm abnormality assays and the Salmonella  assay. Promethazine was nonmutagenic in the Salmonella  test system of Ames.



    Pregnancy



   Teratogenic Effects  



  Pregnancy Category C:  



  Codeine:  A study in rats and rabbits reported no teratogenic effect of codeine administered during the period of organogenesis in doses ranging from 5 to 120 mg/kg. In the rat, doses at the 120-mg/kg level, in the toxic range for the adult animal were associated with an increase in embryo resorption at the time of implantation. In another study a single 100-mg/kg dose of codeine administered to pregnant mice reportedly resulted in delayed ossification in the offspring.



 There are no studies in humans, and the significance of these findings to humans, if any, is not known.



  Promethazine:  Teratogenic effects have not been demonstrated in rat-feeding studies at doses of 6.25 and 12.5 mg/kg of promethazine HCl. These doses are from approximately 2.1 to 4.2 times the maximum recommended total daily dose of promethazine for a 50-kg subject depending upon the indication for which the drug is prescribed. Daily doses of 25 mg/kg intraperitoneally have been found to produce fetal mortality in rats.



 Specific studies to test the action of the drug on parturition, lactation, and development of the animal neonate were not done, but a general preliminary study in rats indicated no effect on these parameters. Although antihistamines have been found to produce fetal mortality in rodents, the pharmacological effects of histamine in the rodent do not parallel those in man. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of promethazine in pregnant women.



 Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with the drug combination - promethazine and codeine. It is not known whether this drug combination can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Promethazine HCl and codeine phosphate syrup should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.



 Promethazine HCl and codeine phosphate syrup should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.



    Nonteratogenic Effects



  Dependence has been reported in newborns whose mothers took opiates regularly during pregnancy. Withdrawal signs include irritability, excessive crying, tremors, hyperreflexia, fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. Signs usually appear during the first few days of life.



 Promethazine administered to a pregnant woman within two weeks of delivery may inhibit platelet aggregation in the newborn.



    Labor and Delivery



  Narcotic analgesics cross the placental barrier. The closer to the delivery and the larger the dose used, the greater the possibility of respiratory depression in the newborn. Narcotic analgesics should be avoided during labor if delivery of a premature infant is anticipated. If the mother has received narcotic analgesics during labor, newborn infants should be observed closely for signs of respiratory depression. Resuscitation may be required (see   OVERDOSAGE    ).



 Limited data suggests that use of promethazine hydrochloride during labor and delivery does not have an appreciable effect on the duration of labor or delivery and does not increase the risk of need for intervention in the newborn.



 The effect of promethazine and/or codeine on later growth and development of the newborn is unknown.



 See also Nonteratogenic Effects  



    Nursing Mothers



  Codeine and its active metabolite, morphine, are present in human milk. There are published studies and cases that have reported excessive sedation, respiratory depression, and death in infants exposed to codeine via breast milk. Women who are ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine achieve higher than expected serum levels of morphine, potentially leading to higher levels of morphine in breast milk that can be dangerous in their breastfed infants. In women with normal codeine metabolism (normal CYP2D6 activity), the amount of codeine secreted into human milk is low and dose-dependent.



 There is no information on the effects of the codeine on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including excess sedation, respiratory depression, and death in a breastfed infant, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with promethazine HCl and codeine phosphate syrup. (See   WARNINGS Ultra-Rapid Metabolism of Codeine and Respiratory Depression    ).



 If infants are exposed to promethazine HCl and codeine phosphate syrup through breast milk, they should be monitored for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breast-feeding is stopped.



 It is not known whether promethazine is excreted in human milk.



    Pediatric Use



  Life threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received codeine. (See   WARNINGS-Ultra-Rapid Metabolism of Codeine and Respiratory Depression    ). Postmarketing cases of respiratory depression, including fatalities have been reported with use of promethazine in pediatric patients. (See   WARNINGS-Promethazine and Respiratory Depression in Children    ). Because of the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression and death:



 *    Promethazine HCl and codeine phosphate syrup is contraindicated in all children younger than age 12 years of age. (See   CONTRAINDICATIONS   ). 
 *    Promethazine HCl and codeine phosphate syrup is contraindicated in pediatric patients younger than 18 years of age following tonsillectomy and/ or adenoidectomy. (See   CONTRAINDICATIONS   ). 
 *    Avoid the use of promethazine HCl and codeine phosphate syrup in adolescents 12 to 18 years of age who have other risk factors that may increase their sensitivity to the respiratory depressant effects of codeine. Risk factors include conditions associated with hypoventilation, such as postoperative status, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, severe pulmonary disease, neuromuscular disease, and concomitant use of other medications that cause respiratory depression. (See   WARNINGS-Ultra-Rapid Metabolism of Codeine and Respiratory Depression   ). 
 *    When prescribing codeine for adolescents, healthcare providers should choose the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time and inform patients and caregivers about these risks and the signs of morphine overdose. (See   OVERDOSAGE   ). 
       Geriatric Use
 

  Clinical studies of promethazine HCl and codeine phosphate syrup did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.



 Sedating drugs may cause confusion and over-sedation in the elderly; elderly patients generally should be started on low doses of promethazine hydrochloride and codeine phosphate syrup and observed closely.

   (see  Boxed Warning  )  



    Ultra-Rapid Metabolism of Codeine and Other Risk Factors for Life-threatening Respiratory Depression in Children



  Life-threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received codeine. Codeine is subject to variability in metabolism based upon CYP2D6 genotype (described below), which can lead to an increased exposure to the active metabolite morphine. Based upon post-marketing reports, children younger than 12 years old appear to be more susceptible to the respiratory depressant effects of codeine, particularly if there are risk factors for respiratory depression. For example, many reported cases of death occurred in the post-operative period following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy, and many of the children had evidence of being ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine. Furthermore, children with obstructive sleep apnea who are treated with codeine for post-tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy pain may be particularly sensitive to its respiratory depressant effect. Because of the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression and death:



 *    Promethazine HCl and codeine phosphate syrup is contraindicated in all children younger than 12 years of age. (See   CONTRAINDICATIONS   ). 
 *    Promethazine HCl and codeine phosphate syrup is contraindicated for postoperative management in pediatric patients younger than 18 years of age following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy. (See   CONTRAINDICATIONS   ). 
 *    Avoid the use of promethazine HCl and codeine phosphate syrup in adolescents 12 to 18 years of age who have other risk factors that may increase their sensitivity to the respiratory depressant effects of codeine. Risk factors include conditions associated with hypoventilation, such as postoperative status, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, severe pulmonary disease, neuromuscular disease, and concomitant use of other medications that cause respiratory depression. 
 *    When prescribing codeine for adolescents, healthcare providers should choose the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time and inform patients and caregivers about these risks and the signs of morphine overdose. (See   OVERDOSAGE   ). 
     Nursing Mothers  
 

 At least one death was reported in a nursing infant who was exposed to high levels of morphine in breast milk because the mother was an ultra-rapid metabolizer of codeine. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with promethazine HCl and codeine phosphate syrup. (See   PRECAUTIONS-Nursing Mothers    ).



  CYP2D6 Genetic Variability: Ultra-rapid metabolizer  



 Some individuals may be ultra-rapid metabolizers because of a specific CYP2D6 genotype (e.g., gene duplications denoted as *1/*1xN or *1/*2xN). The prevalence of this CYP2D6 phenotype varies widely and has been estimated at 1 to 10% for Whites (European, North American), 3 to 4% for Blacks (African Americans), 1 to 2% for East Asians (Chinese, Japanese, Korean), and may be greater than 10% in certain racial/ethnic groups (i.e., Oceanian, Northern African, Middle Eastern, Ashkenazi Jews, Puerto Rican).



 These individuals convert codeine into its active metabolite, morphine, more rapidly and completely than other people. This rapid conversion results in higher than expected serum morphine levels. Even at labeled dosage regimens, individuals who are ultra-rapid metabolizers may have life-threatening or fatal respiratory depression or experience signs of overdose (such as extreme sleepiness, confusion, or shallow breathing). (See   OVERDOSAGE    ). Therefore, individuals who are ultra-rapid metabolizers should not use promethazine HCl and codeine phosphate syrup.



    Promethazine and Respiratory Depression in Children



    *     Children  
 *     Postmarketing cases of respiratory depression, including fatalities have been reported with use of promethazine in pediatric patients. Concomitant administration with other respiratory depressants may increase the risk of respiratory depression. Children may be particularly sensitive to the additive respiratory depressant effects when promethazine is combined with other respiratory depressants, including codeine. See   WARNINGS- Ultra-Rapid Metabolism of Codeine and Respiratory Depression   for limitations on the use of promethazine HCl and codeine phosphate syrup in children. 
 *     Excessively large dosages of antihistamines, including promethazine hydrochloride, in pediatric patients may cause sudden death (see   OVERDOSAGE   ). 
 *     Concomitant Conditions and Other Risk Factors  
 *     Avoid use of promethazine in patients at risk for respiratory depression. Risk factors include conditions associated with hypoventilation, such as postoperative status, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, severe pulmonary disease, neuromuscular disease, and concomitant use of other medications that cause respiratory depression. (See   WARNINGS-Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants   ). 
       Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants
 

  Concomitant use of opioids, including promethazine HCl and codeine phosphate syrup, with benzodiazepines, or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, avoid use of opioid cough medications in patients taking benzodiazepines, other CNS depressants, or alcohol. (See   PRECAUTIONS-Drug Interactions    ).



 Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. Because of similar pharmacologic properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with concomitant use of opioid cough medications and benzodiazepines, other CNS depressants, or alcohol.



 Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation if promethazine HCl and codeine phosphate syrup is used with benzodiazepines, alcohol, or other CNS depressants. (See   PRECAUTIONS-Information for Patients    ).



    CNS Depression and Other CNS Effects



    *     CNS Depression  
 *     Promethazine may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery. The impairment may be amplified by concomitant use of other central-nervous-system depressants such as alcohol, sedatives/hypnotics (including barbiturates), narcotics, narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, tricyclic antidepressants, and tranquilizers; therefore avoid use of promethazine HCl and codeine phosphate syrup in patients on these medications. (See   PRECAUTIONS-Information for Patients   and   Drug Interactions   ). 
 *     Convulsions  
 *     Convulsions have occurred with therapeutic doses and overdoses of promethazine hydrochloride in pediatric patients. Promethazine may lower seizure threshold. It should be used with caution in persons with seizure disorders or in persons who are using concomitant medications, such as narcotics or local anesthetics, which may also affect seizure threshold. 
 *     Dystonias  
 *     Promethazine is a phenothiazine. Phenothiazines are associated with dystonic reactions. In pediatric patients who are acutely ill associated with dehydration, there is an increased susceptibility to dystonias with the use of promethazine HCl. 
 *     Head Injury and Increased Intracranial Pressure  
 *     The respiratory-depressant effects of narcotic analgesics and their capacity to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of head injury, intracranial lesions, or a pre-existing increase in intracranial pressure. Narcotics may produce adverse reactions which may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injuries. 
       Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome
 

  A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with promethazine HCl alone or in combination with antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmias).



 The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology.



 The management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of promethazine HCl, antipsychotic drugs, if any, and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS.



 Since recurrences of NMS have been reported with phenothiazines, the reintroduction of promethazine HCl should be carefully considered.



    Pulmonary Considerations



    *     Asthma and Other Pulmonary Disease  
 *     Narcotic analgesics or cough suppressants, including codeine, should not be used in patients with severe asthma or those with frequent asthma attacks (see   CONTRAINDICATIONS   ). Nor should they be used in acute febrile illness associated with productive cough or in chronic respiratory disease where interference with ability to clear the tracheobronchial tree of secretions would have a deleterious effect on the patient's respiratory function. 
 *     Unresponsive Cough  
 *     Dosage of codeine should not be increased if cough fails to respond; an unresponsive cough should be reevaluated in 5 days or sooner for possible underlying pathology, such as foreign body or lower respiratory tract disease. 
       Cardiovascular Effects
 

    *     Hypotension  
 *     Codeine may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients. 
       Bone-Marrow Depression
 

  Promethazine should be used with caution in patients with bone-marrow depression. Leukopenia and agranulocytosis have been reported, usually when promethazine HCl has been used in association with other known marrow-toxic agents.



    Constipation



  Codeine may cause or aggravate constipation.



    Other Considerations



  Administration of promethazine has been associated with reported cholestatic jaundice.



 Administration of codeine may be accomplished by histamine release and should be used with caution in atopic children.
