  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not predict the rates observed in a broader patient population in clinical practice.

 Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma with BRAF V600E Mutation This section describes adverse drug reactions (ADRs) identified from analyses of Trial 1 and Trial 2  [see  Clinical Studies (14)  ]  . Trial 1 randomized (1:1) 675 treatment-naive patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma to receive ZELBORAF 960 mg orally twice daily or dacarbazine 1000 mg/m  2  intravenously every 3 weeks. In Trial 2, 132 patients with metastatic melanoma and failure of at least one prior systemic therapy received treatment with ZELBORAF 960 mg orally twice daily.

   Table 1  presents adverse reactions reported in at least 10% of unresectable or metastatic melanoma patients treated with ZELBORAF. The most common adverse reactions of any grade (&gt;= 30% in either study) in ZELBORAF-treated patients were arthralgia, rash, alopecia, fatigue, photosensitivity reaction, nausea, pruritus, and skin papilloma. The most common (&gt;= 5%) Grade 3 adverse reactions were cuSCC and rash. The incidence of Grade 4 adverse reactions was &lt;= 4% in both studies.

 The incidence of adverse events resulting in permanent discontinuation of study medication in Trial 1 was 7% for the ZELBORAF arm and 4% for the dacarbazine arm. In Trial 2, the incidence of adverse events resulting in permanent discontinuation of study medication was 3% in ZELBORAF-treated patients. The median duration of study treatment was 4.2 months for ZELBORAF and 0.8 months for dacarbazine in Trial 1, and 5.7 months for ZELBORAF in Trial 2.

 This section describes adverse reactions identified from analyses of Trial 4  [see  Clinical Studies (14)  ]  . In Trial 4, 22 patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive ECD received ZELBORAF 960 mg twice daily.

 The median treatment duration for ECD patients in this study was 14.2 months.  Table 3  presents adverse reactions reported in at least 20% of BRAF V600 mutation-positive ECD patients treated with ZELBORAF.

 In Trial 4, the most commonly reported adverse reactions (&gt; 50%) in patients with BRAF V600 mutation- positive ECD treated with ZELBORAF were arthralgia, rash maculo-papular, alopecia, fatigue, electrocardiogram QT interval prolonged, and skin papilloma. The most common (&gt;= 10%) Grade ▯ 3 adverse reactions were squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, hypertension, rash maculo-papular, and arthralgia.

 The incidence of adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of study medication was 32%.

   5.1 New Primary Malignancies

    Cutaneous Malignancies    

  Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, keratoacanthoma, and melanoma occurred at a higher incidence in patients receiving ZELBORAF compared to those in the control arm in Trial 1. The incidence of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (cuSCC) and keratoacanthomas in the ZELBORAF arm was 24% compared to &lt; 1% in the dacarbazine arm [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . The median time to the first appearance of cuSCC was 7 to 8 weeks; approximately 33% of patients who developed a cuSCC while receiving ZELBORAF experienced at least one additional occurrence with median time between occurrences of 6 weeks. Potential risk factors associated with cuSCC observed in clinical studies using ZELBORAF included age (&gt;= 65 years), prior skin cancer, and chronic sun exposure.  

  In Trial 4, in patients with ECD, the incidence of cuSCC and/or keratoacanthomas was 40.9% (9/22). The median time to first appearance of cuSCC amongst patients with at least one occurrence was 12.1 weeks.  

  In Trial 1, in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, new primary malignant melanoma occurred in 2.1% (7/336) of patients receiving ZELBORAF compared to none of the patients receiving dacarbazine.  

  Perform dermatologic evaluations prior to initiation of therapy and every 2 months while on therapy. Manage suspicious skin lesions with excision and dermatopathologic evaluation. Consider dermatologic monitoring for 6 months following discontinuation of ZELBORAF.  

     Non-Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma    

  Non-cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (non-cuSCC) of the head and neck can occur in patients receiving ZELBORAF [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Monitor patients receiving ZELBORAF closely for signs or symptoms of new non-cuSCC.  

     Other Malignancies    

  Based on mechanism of action, ZELBORAF may promote malignancies associated with activation of RAS through mutation or other mechanisms [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]  . Monitor patients receiving ZELBORAF closely for signs or symptoms of other malignancies.  

  Cases of myeloid neoplasms amongst patients with ECD have been observed, including in patients who have received ZELBORAF. Monitoring complete blood count in ECD patients with co-existing myeloid malignancies is recommended.  

    5.2 Tumor Promotion in BRAF Wild-Type Melanoma

  In vitro experiments have demonstrated paradoxical activation of MAP-kinase signaling and increased cell proliferation in BRAF wild-type cells that are exposed to BRAF inhibitors. Confirm evidence of BRAF V600E mutation in tumor specimens prior to initiation of ZELBORAF [see  Indications and Usage (1)  and  Dosage and Administration (2.1)  ]  .

    5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions

  Anaphylaxis and other serious hypersensitivity reactions can occur during treatment and upon re-initiation of treatment with ZELBORAF. Severe hypersensitivity reactions included generalized rash and erythema, hypotension, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS syndrome). Permanently discontinue ZELBORAF in patients who experience a severe hypersensitivity reaction [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ]  .

    5.4 Dermatologic Reactions

  Severe dermatologic reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, can occur in patients receiving ZELBORAF. Permanently discontinue ZELBORAF in patients who experience a severe dermatologic reaction [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  

    5.5 QT Prolongation

  Concentration-dependent QT prolongation occurred in an uncontrolled, open-label QT sub-study in previously treated patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive metastatic melanoma [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)  ]  . QT prolongation may lead to an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias, including Torsade de Pointes.

 Do not start treatment in patients with uncorrectable electrolyte abnormalities, QTc &gt; 500 ms, or long QT syndrome, or in patients who are taking medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval. Prior to and following treatment initiation or after dose modification of ZELBORAF for QTc prolongation, evaluate ECG and electrolytes (including potassium, magnesium, and calcium) after 15 days, monthly during the first 3 months, and then every 3 months thereafter or more often as clinically indicated.

 Withhold ZELBORAF in patients who develop QTc &gt; 500 ms (Grade 3). Upon recovery to QTc &lt;= 500 ms (Grade &lt;= 2), restart at a reduced dose. Permanently discontinue ZELBORAF treatment if the QTc interval remains &gt; 500 ms and increased &gt; 60 ms from pre-treatment values after controlling cardiac risk factors for QT prolongation (e.g., electrolyte abnormalities, congestive heart failure, and bradyarrhythmias) [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .

    5.6 Hepatotoxicity

  Liver injury leading to functional hepatic impairment, including coagulopathy or other organ dysfunction, can occur with ZELBORAF [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Monitor transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin before initiation of treatment and monthly during treatment, or as clinically indicated. Manage laboratory abnormalities with dose reduction, treatment interruption, or treatment discontinuation [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .

    Concurrent Administration with Ipilimumab  

 The safety and effectiveness of ZELBORAF in combination with ipilimumab have not been established [see  Indications and Usage (1)  ]  . In a dose-finding trial, Grade 3 increases in transaminases and bilirubin occurred in a majority of patients who received concurrent ipilimumab (3 mg/kg) and vemurafenib (960 mg BID or 720 mg BID) [see  Drug Interactions (7.3)  ].  

    5.7 Photosensitivity

  Mild to severe photosensitivity can occur in patients treated with ZELBORAF [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing and use a broad spectrum UVA/UVB sunscreen and lip balm (SPF &gt;= 30) when outdoors.

 Institute dose modifications for intolerable Grade 2 or greater photosensitivity [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  .

    5.8 Ophthalmologic Reactions

  Uveitis, blurry vision, and photophobia can occur in patients treated with ZELBORAF. In Trial 1, uveitis, including iritis, occurred in 2.1% (7/336) of patients receiving ZELBORAF compared to no patients in the dacarbazine arm. Treatment with steroid and mydriatic ophthalmic drops may be required to manage uveitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of uveitis.

    5.9 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

  Based on its mechanism of action, ZELBORAF can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ZELBORAF and for 2 weeks after the final dose [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1  ,  8.3)  and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)  ]  .

    5.10 Radiation Sensitization and Radiation Recall

  Radiation sensitization and recall, in some cases severe, involving cutaneous and visceral organs have been reported in patients treated with radiation prior to, during, or subsequent to vemurafenib treatment .  Fatal cases have been reported in patients with visceral organ involvement. [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ]  .

 Monitor patients closely when vemurafenib is administered concomitantly or sequentially with radiation treatment.

    5.11 Renal Failure

  Renal failure, including acute interstitial nephritis and acute tubular necrosis, can occur with ZELBORAF. In Trial 1, in patients with metastatic melanoma, 26% of ZELBORAF-treated patients and 5% of dacarbazine-treated patients experienced Grade 1-2 creatinine elevations [greater than 1 and up to 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN)]; 1.2% of ZELBORAF-treated patients and 1.1% of dacarbazine-treated patients experienced Grade 3-4 creatinine elevations (greater than 3 times ULN).

 In Trial 4, in patients with ECD, 86% (19/22) of patients experienced Grade 1/2 creatinine elevations and 9.1% (2/22) of patients experienced Grade 3 creatinine elevations.

 Measure serum creatinine before initiation of ZELBORAF and periodically during treatment.

    5.12 Dupuytren's Contracture and Plantar Fascial Fibromatosis

   Dupuytren's contracture and plantar fascial fibromatosis have been reported with ZELBORAF. The majority of cases were mild to moderate, but severe, disabling cases of Dupuytren's contracture have also been reported [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ,  Adverse Reactions (6.1  ,  6.2)  ].
