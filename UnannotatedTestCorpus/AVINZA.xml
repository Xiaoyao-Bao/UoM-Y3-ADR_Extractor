  6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 In controlled and open-label clinical studies, 560 patients with chronic malignant or non-malignant pain were treated with AVINZA. The most common serious adverse events reported with administration of AVINZA were vomiting, nausea, death, dehydration, dyspnea, and sepsis. (Deaths occurred in patients treated for pain due to underlying malignancy.) Serious adverse events caused by morphine include respiratory depression, apnea, and to a lesser degree, circulatory depression, respiratory arrest, shock and cardiac arrest.



 The most common adverse events (seen in greater than 10%) reported by patients treated with AVINZA during the clinical trials at least once during therapy were constipation, nausea, somnolence, vomiting, and headache. Adverse events occurring in 5-10% of study patients were peripheral edema, diarrhea, abdominal pain, infection, urinary tract infection, accidental injury, flu syndrome, back pain, rash, sweating, fever, insomnia, depression, paresthesia, anorexia, dry mouth, asthenia and dyspnea. Other less common side effects expected from opioid analgesics, including morphine, or seen in fewer than 5% of patients taking AVINZA in the clinical trials were:



   Body as a Whole:  malaise, withdrawal syndrome.



   Cardiovascular System:  bradycardia, hypertension, hypotension, palpitations, syncope, tachycardia.



   Digestive System:  biliary pain, dyspepsia, dysphagia, gastroenteritis, abnormal liver function tests, rectal disorder, thirst.



   Hemic and Lymphatic System:  anemia, thrombocytopenia.



   Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders:  edema, weight loss.



   Musculoskeletal:  skeletal muscle rigidity.



   Nervous System:  abnormal dreams, abnormal gait, agitation, amnesia, anxiety, ataxia, confusion, convulsions, coma, delirium, euphoria, hallucinations, lethargy, nervousness, abnormal thinking, tremor, vasodilation, vertigo  .  



   Respiratory System:  hiccup, hypoventilation, voice alteration.



   Skin and Appendages:  dry skin, urticaria.



   Special Senses:  amblyopia, eye pain, taste perversion.



   Urogenital System:  abnormal ejaculation, dysuria, impotence, decreased libido, oliguria, urinary retention.



 Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in AVINZA. Advise patients how to recognize such a reaction and when to seek medical attention.

        Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse      



   AVINZA  (r)   exposes patients and other users to the risks of opioid addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess each patient's risk prior to prescribing AVINZA, and monitor all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors or conditions   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  .   



       Life-threatening Respiratory Depression    



   Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of AVINZA. Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of AVINZA or following a dose increase  .   Instruct patients to swallow AVINZA capsules whole or to sprinkle the contents of the capsule on applesauce and swallow immediately without chewing. Crushing, chewing, or dissolving AVINZA can cause rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of morphine   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]  .  



     Accidental Ingestion  



   Accidental ingestion of even one dose of AVINZA, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of morphine   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]  .  



     Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome   



   Prolonged  use of AVINZA during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  .  



       Interaction with Alcohol    



   Instruct patients not to consume alcoholic beverages or use prescription or non-prescription products that contain alcohol while taking AVINZA. The co-ingestion of alcohol with AVINZA may result in increased plasma levels and a potentially fatal overdose of morphine   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.4)    .   
</Section>
    <Section id="S3" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Interactions with CNS depressants: Concomitant use may cause profound sedation, respiratory depression, and death. If coadministration is required, consider dose reduction of one or both drugs because of additive pharmacological effects. (  5.4  ,  7.2  ) 
 *  Elderly, cachectic, debilitated patients, and those with chronic pulmonary disease: Monitor closely because of increased risk for life-threatening respiratory depression. (  5.5  ,  5.6  ) 
 *  Hypotensive effect: Monitor during dose initiation and titration. (  5.7  ) 
 *  Patients with head injury or increased intracranial pressure: Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of AVINZA in patients with impaired consciousness or coma susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2retention. (  5.8  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse



   AVINZA contains morphine, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, AVINZA exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see  Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)  ].  As modified-release products such as AVINZA deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of morphine present.  



  Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed AVINZA and in those who obtain the drug illicitly. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused.  



  Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing AVINZA, and monitor all patients receiving AVINZA for the development of these behaviors or conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol addiction or abuse) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the prescribing of AVINZA for the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed modified-release opioid formulations such as AVINZA, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of AVINZA along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse.  



  Abuse or misuse of AVINZA by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product will result in the uncontrolled delivery of the morphine and can result in overdose and death [see  Overdosage (10)  ]  .  



  Opioid agonists such as AVINZA are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing AVINZA. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see  Patient Counseling Information (17)  ]  . Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.  



    5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression



   Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of modified-release opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression from opioid use, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see  Overdosage (10)  ].  Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.  



 While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of AVINZA, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dose increase. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with AVINZA and following dose increases.



 To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of AVINZA are essential [see  Dosage and Administration (2)  ]  . Overestimating the AVINZA dose when converting patients from another opioid product can result in fatal overdose with the first dose.



  Accidental ingestion of even one dose of AVINZA, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of morphine.  



    5.3 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome



   Prolonged use of AVINZA during pregnancy can result in withdrawal signs in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available.  



  Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn.  



    5.4 Interactions with Central Nervous System Depressants



   Patients must not consume alcoholic beverages or prescription or non-prescription products containing alcohol while on AVINZA therapy. The co-ingestion of alcohol with AVINZA may result in increased plasma levels and a potentially fatal overdose of morphine [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  .  



  Hypotension, profound sedation, coma, respiratory depression, and death may result if AVINZA is used concomitantly with alcohol or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (e.g., sedatives, anxiolytics, hypnotics, neuroleptics, other opioids).  



  When considering the use of AVINZA in a patient taking a CNS depressant, assess the duration of use of the CNS depressant and the patient's response, including the degree of tolerance that has developed to CNS depression. Additionally, evaluate the patient's use of alcohol or illicit drugs that cause CNS depression. If the decision to begin AVINZA is made, start with AVINZA 30 mg every 24 hours, monitor patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, and consider using a lower dose of the concomitant CNS depressant [see  Drug Interactions (7.2)  ]  .  



    5.5 Use in Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients



   Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients. Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating AVINZA and when AVINZA is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]  .  



    5.6 Use in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease



  Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy and titrating with AVINZA, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of AVINZA may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]  . Consider the use of alternative non-opioid analgesics in these patients if possible.



    5.7 Hypotensive Effect



  AVINZA may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g. phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see  Drug Interactions (7.2)  ]  . Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of AVINZA. In patients with circulatory shock, AVINZA may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of AVINZA in patients with circulatory shock.



    5.8 Use in Patients with Head Injury or Increased Intracranial Pressure



  Monitor patients taking AVINZA who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors) for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with AVINZA. AVINZA may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2retention can further increase intracranial pressure .  Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury.



 Avoid the use of AVINZA in patients with impaired consciousness or coma.



    5.9 Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions



  AVINZA is contraindicated in patients with paralytic ileus. Avoid the use of AVINZA in patients with other GI obstruction.



 The morphine in AVINZA may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. Opioids may cause increases in the serum amylase.



    5.10 Use in Patients with Convulsive or Seizure Disorders



  The morphine in AVINZA may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during AVINZA therapy.



    5.11 Avoidance of Withdrawal



   Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with a opioid agonist analgesic, including AVINZA. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms.  



 When discontinuing AVINZA, gradually taper the dose [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  . Do not abruptly discontinue AVINZA.



    5.12 Driving and Operating Machinery



  AVINZA may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of AVINZA and know how they will react to the medication.
