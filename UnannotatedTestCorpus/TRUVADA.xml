  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials Experience in HIV-1 Infected Subjects  



     Clinical Trials in Adult Subjects  



 In Study 934, 511 antiretroviral-naive subjects received efavirenz (EFV) administered in combination with either FTC+TDF (N=257) or zidovudine (AZT)/lamivudine (3TC) (N=254) for 144 weeks. The most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 10%, all grades) included diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, headache, dizziness, depression, insomnia, abnormal dreams, and rash. Table 3 provides the treatment-emergent adverse reactions (Grades 2-4) occurring in greater than or equal to 5% of subjects treated in any treatment group.



 Skin discoloration, manifested by hyperpigmentation, occurred in 3% of subjects taking FTC+TDF, and was generally mild and asymptomatic. The mechanism and clinical significance are unknown.

             Clinical Trials in Pediatric Subjects  
 

     Emtricitabine:  In addition to the adverse reactions reported in adults, anemia and hyperpigmentation were observed in 7% and 32%, respectively, of pediatric subjects (3 months to less than 18 years of age) who received treatment with FTC in the larger of two open-label, uncontrolled pediatric trials (N=116).



     Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate:  In pediatric clinical trials (Studies 352 and 321) conducted in 184 HIV-1 infected subjects 2 to less than 18 years of age, the adverse reactions observed in pediatric subjects who received treatment with TDF were consistent with those observed in clinical trials of TDF in adults.



 In Study 352 (2 to less than 12 years of age), 89 pediatric subjects received TDF for a median exposure of 104 weeks. Of these, 4 subjects discontinued from the trial due to adverse reactions consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy. Three of these 4 subjects presented with hypophosphatemia and had decreases in total body or spine BMD Z-score  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.5)  ].  Total body BMD gain at Week 48 was less in the TDF group compared to the stavudine (d4T) or zidovudine (AZT) treatment groups. The mean rate of BMD gain in lumbar spine was similar between treatment groups. One TDF-treated subject and none of the d4T- or AZT-treated subjects experienced significant (greater than 4%) lumbar spine BMD loss at Week 48. Changes from baseline in BMD Z-scores were -0.012 for lumbar spine and -0.338 for total body in the 64 subjects who were treated with TDF for 96 weeks.



 In Study 321 (12 to less than 18 years of age), the mean rate of BMD gain at Week 48 was less in the TDF compared to the placebo treatment group. Six TDF-treated subjects and one placebo-treated subject had significant (greater than 4%) lumbar spine BMD loss at Week 48. Changes from baseline BMD Z-scores were -0.341 for lumbar spine and -0.458 for total body in the 28 subjects who were treated with TDF for 96 weeks.



 In both trials, skeletal growth (height) appeared to be unaffected.



     Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trial Experience in Uninfected Subjects Taking TRUVADA for HIV-1 PrEP  



     Clinical Trials in Adult Subjects  



 The safety profile of TRUVADA for HIV-1 PrEP was comparable to that observed in clinical trials of HIV-infected subjects based on two randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials (iPrEx, Partners PrEP) in which 2,830 HIV-1 uninfected adults received TRUVADA once daily for HIV-1 PrEP. Subjects were followed for a median of 71 weeks and 87 weeks, respectively. Table 5 provides a list of selected adverse events that occurred in 2% or more of subjects in any treatment group in the iPrEx trial, with an incidence greater than placebo.

         In the Partners PrEP trial, the frequency of adverse events in the TRUVADA treatment group was generally either less than or the same as in the placebo group.
 

     Laboratory Abnormalities  : Table 6 provides a list of Grade 2-4 laboratory abnormalities observed in the iPrEx and Partners PrEP trials. Six subjects in the TDF-containing arms of the Partners PrEP trial discontinued from the trial due to an increase in serum creatinine compared with no discontinuations in the placebo group. One subject in the TRUVADA arm of the iPrEx trial discontinued from the trial due to an increase in serum creatinine and another subject discontinued due to low serum phosphorus. Grades 2-3 proteinuria (2-4+) and/or glycosuria (3+) occurred in less than 1% of subjects treated with TRUVADA in the iPrEx trial and Partners PrEP trial.

               Changes in Bone Mineral Density:  In clinical trials of HIV-1 uninfected individuals, decreases in BMD were observed. In the iPrEx trial, a substudy of 503 subjects found mean changes from baseline in BMD ranging from -0.4% to -1.0% across total hip, spine, femoral neck, and trochanter in the TRUVADA group compared with the placebo group, which returned toward baseline after discontinuation of treatment. Thirteen percent of TRUVADA-treated subjects versus 6% of placebo-treated subjects lost at least 5% of BMD at the spine during treatment. Bone fractures were reported in 1.7% of the TRUVADA group compared with 1.4% in the placebo group. No correlation between BMD and fractures was noted  [see  Clinical Studies (14.3)  ]  . The Partners PrEP trial found similar fracture rates between the treatment and placebo groups (0.8% and 0.6%, respectively); no BMD evaluations were performed in this trial  [see  Clinical Studies (14.4)  ]  .
 

     Clinical Trials in Adolescent Subjects  



 In a single-arm, open-label clinical trial (ATN113), in which 67 HIV-1 uninfected adolescent (15 to 18 years of age) men who have sex with men received TRUVADA once daily for HIV-1 PrEP, the safety profile of TRUVADA was similar to that observed in adults. Median duration to exposure of TRUVADA was 47 weeks  [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.4)  ].  



 In the ATN113 trial, median BMD increased from baseline to Week 48, +2.58% for lumbar spine and +0.72% for total body. One subject had significant (greater than or equal to 4%) total body BMD loss at Week 24. Median changes from baseline BMD Z-scores were 0.0 for lumbar spine and -0.2 for total body at Week 48. Three subjects showed a worsening (change from &gt; -2 to &lt;= -2) from baseline in their lumbar spine or total body BMD Z-scores at Week 24 or 48. Interpretation of these data, however, may be limited by the low rate of adherence to TRUVADA by Week 48.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of TDF. No additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of FTC. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Immune System Disorders  allergic reaction, including angioedema



   Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders  lactic acidosis, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia



   Respiratory, Thoracic  ,  and Mediastinal Disorders  dyspnea



   Gastrointestinal Disorders  pancreatitis, increased amylase, abdominal pain



   Hepatobiliary Disorders  hepatic steatosis, hepatitis, increased liver enzymes (most commonly AST, ALT gamma GT)



   Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders  rash



   Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders  rhabdomyolysis, osteomalacia (manifested as bone pain and which may contribute to fractures), muscular weakness, myopathy



   Renal and Urinary Disorders  acute renal failure, renal failure, acute tubular necrosis, Fanconi syndrome, proximal renal tubulopathy, interstitial nephritis (including acute cases), nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, renal insufficiency, increased creatinine, proteinuria, polyuria



   General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions  asthenia



 The following adverse reactions, listed under the body system headings above, may occur as a consequence of proximal renal tubulopathy: rhabdomyolysis, osteomalacia, hypokalemia, muscular weakness, myopathy, hypophosphatemia.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING:  POSTTREATMENT ACUTE EXACERBATION OF HEPATITIS B and RISK OF DRUG RESISTANCE WITH USE OF TRUVADA FOR HIV-1 PRE-EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS (PrEP) IN UNDIAGNOSED EARLY HIV-1 INFECTION

    WARNING:  POSTTREATMENT ACUTE EXACERBATION OF HEPATITIS B and RISK OF DRUG RESISTANCE WITH USE OF TRUVADA FOR HIV-1 PRE-EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS (PrEP) IN UNDIAGNOSED EARLY HIV-1 INFECTION  

    Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B virus (HBV) have been reported in HBV-infected patients who have discontinued TRUVADA. Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in HBV-infected patients who discontinue TRUVADA. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  .  



   TRUVADA used for HIV-1 PrEP must only be prescribed to individuals confirmed to be HIV-negative immediately prior to initiating and periodically (at least every 3 months) during use. Drug-resistant HIV-1 variants have been identified with use of TRUVADA for HIV-1 PrEP following undetected acute HIV-1 infection. Do not initiate TRUVADA for HIV-1 PrEP if signs or symptoms of acute HIV-1 infection are present unless negative infection status is confirmed   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]  .   



   EXCERPT:   WARNING:  POSTTREATMENT ACUTE EXACERBATION OF HEPATITIS B and RISK OF DRUG RESISTANCE WITH USE OF TRUVADA FOR HIV-1 PRE-EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS (PrEP) IN UNDIAGNOSED EARLY HIV-1 INFECTION

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Comprehensive management to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV-1: Use as part of a comprehensive prevention strategy including other prevention measures; strictly adhere to dosing schedule. (  5.2  ) 
 *  Management to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV-1 drug resistance: refer to full prescribing information for additional detail. (  5.2  ) 
 *  New onset or worsening renal impairment: Can include acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome. Avoid administering TRUVADA with concurrent or recent use of nephrotoxic drugs. (  5.3  ) 
 *  Immune reconstitution syndrome: May necessitate further evaluation and treatment. (  5.4  ) 
 *  Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD): Consider assessment of BMD in patients with a history of pathologic fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss. (  5.5  ) 
 *  Lactic acidosis/severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: Discontinue treatment in patients who develop symptoms or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity. (  5.6  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Severe Acute Exacerbation of Hepatitis B in Patients with HBV Infection



   All patients should be tested for the presence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) before or when initiating TRUVADA [see  Dosage and Administration (2.1)  ]  .  



  Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B (e.g., liver decompensation and liver failure) have been reported in HBV-infected patients who have discontinued TRUVADA. Patients infected with HBV who discontinue TRUVADA should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted, especially in patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, since posttreatment exacerbation of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation and liver failure. HBV-uninfected individuals should be offered vaccination.  



    5.2 Comprehensive Management to Reduce the Risk of Acquiring HIV-1 and Development of HIV-1 Resistance When TRUVADA Is Used for HIV-1 PrEP



  Use TRUVADA for HIV-1 PrEP only as part of a comprehensive prevention strategy that includes other prevention measures, such as safer sex practices, because TRUVADA is not always effective in preventing acquisition of HIV-1 [see  Clinical Studies (14.3  and  14.4)  ]  .



 *   Counsel uninfected individuals about safer sex practices that include consistent and correct use of condoms, knowledge of their HIV-1 status and that of their partner(s), the importance of virologic suppression in their partner(s) with HIV-1, and regular testing for other sexually transmitted infections that can facilitate HIV-1 transmission (such as syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea).  
 *  Inform uninfected individuals about and support their efforts in reducing sexual risk behavior. 
    Use TRUVADA to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV-1 only in individuals confirmed to be HIV-negative .  HIV-1 resistance substitutions may emerge in individuals with undetected HIV-1 infection who are taking only TRUVADA, because TRUVADA alone does not constitute a complete regimen for HIV-1 treatment [see  Microbiology (12.4)  ];  therefore, care should be taken to minimize drug exposure in HIV-infected individuals.
 

 *  Many HIV-1 tests, such as rapid tests, detect anti-HIV antibodies and may not identify HIV-1 during the acute stage of infection. Prior to initiating TRUVADA for HIV-1 PrEP, evaluate seronegative individuals for current or recent signs or symptoms consistent with acute viral infections (e.g., fever, fatigue, myalgia, skin rash) and ask about potential exposure events (e.g., unprotected, or condom broke during, sex with an HIV-1 infected partner) that may have occurred within the last month. 
 *  If clinical symptoms consistent with acute viral infection are present and recent (&lt;1 month) exposures are suspected, delay starting HIV-1 PrEP for at least one month and reconfirm HIV-1 status or use a test approved or cleared by the FDA as an aid in the diagnosis of HIV-1 infection, including acute or primary HIV-1 infection. 
     While using TRUVADA for HIV-1 PrEP, HIV-1 screening tests should be repeated at least every 3 months, and upon diagnosis of any sexually transmitted infections. Some individuals, such as adolescents, may benefit from more frequent visits and counseling [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.4)  ]  .  
 

 *   If a screening test indicates possible HIV-1 infection, or if symptoms consistent with acute HIV-1 infection develop following a potential exposure event, convert the HIV-1 PrEP regimen to an HIV treatment regimen until negative infection status is confirmed using a test approved or cleared by the FDA as an aid in the diagnosis of HIV-1, including acute or primary HIV-1 infection.  
    Counsel uninfected individuals to strictly adhere to the recommended TRUVADA dosing schedule. The effectiveness of TRUVADA in reducing the risk of acquiring HIV-1 is strongly correlated with adherence, as demonstrated by measurable drug levels in clinical trials [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.4)  ,  Microbiology (12.4)  , and  Clinical Studies (14.3  and  14.4)  ]  .
 

    5.3 New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment



  Emtricitabine and tenofovir are principally eliminated by the kidney. Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia), has been reported with the use of TDF, a component of TRUVADA [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ]  .



  Prior to initiation and during use of TRUVADA, on a clinically appropriate schedule, assess serum creatinine, estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein in all patients. In patients with chronic kidney disease, also assess serum phosphorus.  



 TRUVADA should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent (e.g., high-dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) [see  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ]  . Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high-dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in HIV-infected patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on TDF. Some patients required hospitalization and renal replacement therapy. Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered, if needed, in patients at risk for renal dysfunction.



 Persistent or worsening bone pain, pain in extremities, fractures, and/or muscular pain or weakness may be manifestations of proximal renal tubulopathy and should prompt an evaluation of renal function in patients at risk of renal dysfunction.



    Treatment of HIV-1 Infection  



 Dosing interval adjustment of TRUVADA and close monitoring of renal function are recommended in all patients with estimated creatinine clearance 30-49 mL/min [see  Dosage and Administration (2.6)  ]  . No safety or efficacy data are available in patients with renal impairment who received TRUVADA using these dosing guidelines, so the potential benefit of TRUVADA therapy should be assessed against the potential risk of renal toxicity. TRUVADA is not recommended in patients with estimated creatinine clearance below 30 mL/min or patients requiring hemodialysis.



    HIV-1 PrEP  



 TRUVADA for HIV-1 PrEP is not recommended in uninfected individuals with estimated creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/min. If a decrease in estimated creatinine clearance is observed while using TRUVADA for HIV-1 PrEP, evaluate potential causes and re-assess potential risks and benefits of continued use [see  Dosage and Administration (2.6)  ]  .



    5.4 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome



  Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in HIV-1 infected patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including TRUVADA. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, HIV-1 infected patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium  infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii  pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.



 Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.



    5.5 Bone Loss and Mineralization Defects



   Bone Mineral Density  



 In clinical trials in HIV-1 infected adults and in a clinical trial of HIV-1 uninfected individuals, TDF (a component of TRUVADA) was associated with slightly greater decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) and increases in biochemical markers of bone metabolism, suggesting increased bone turnover relative to comparators [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Serum parathyroid hormone levels and 1,25 Vitamin D levels were also higher in subjects receiving TDF.



 Clinical trials evaluating TDF in pediatric and adolescent subjects were conducted. Under normal circumstances, BMD increases rapidly in pediatric patients. In HIV-1 infected subjects aged 2 years to less than 18 years, bone effects were similar to those observed in adult subjects and suggest increased bone turnover. Total body BMD gain was less in the TDF-treated HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects as compared to the control groups. Similar trends were observed in adolescent subjects aged 12 years to less than 18 years treated for chronic hepatitis B. In all pediatric trials, skeletal growth (height) appeared to be unaffected.



 The effects of TDF-associated changes in BMD and biochemical markers on long-term bone health and future fracture risk are unknown. Assessment of BMD should be considered for adult and pediatric patients who have a history of pathologic bone fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss. Although the effect of supplementation with calcium and vitamin D was not studied, such supplementation may be beneficial. If bone abnormalities are suspected, appropriate consultation should be obtained.



    Mineralization Defects  



 Cases of osteomalacia associated with proximal renal tubulopathy, manifested as bone pain or pain in extremities and which may contribute to fractures, have been reported in association with TDF use [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Arthralgia and muscle pain or weakness have also been reported in cases of proximal renal tubulopathy. Hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia secondary to proximal renal tubulopathy should be considered in patients at risk of renal dysfunction who present with persistent or worsening bone or muscle symptoms while receiving TDF-containing products [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ].  



    5.6 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis



  Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs, including FTC and TDF, components of TRUVADA, alone or in combination with other antiretrovirals. Treatment with TRUVADA should be suspended in any patient or uninfected individual who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations).



    5.7 Risk of Adverse Reactions Due to Drug Interactions



   The concomitant use of TRUVADA and other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to possible clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of concomitant drugs [see  Drug Interactions (7.2)  ].    



  See  Table 7  for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during therapy with TRUVADA; review concomitant medications during therapy with TRUVADA; and monitor for adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drugs.
