  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of PERCOCET. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 Serious adverse reactions that may be associated with oxycodone and acetaminophen use include respiratory depression, apnea, respiratory arrest, circulatory depression, hypotension, and shock [see    OVERDOSAGE    ].



 The most frequently observed non-serious adverse reactions include lightheadedness, dizziness, drowsiness or sedation, nausea, and vomiting. These effects seem to be more prominent in ambulatory than in nonambulatory patients, and some of these adverse reactions may be alleviated if the patient lies down. Other adverse reactions include euphoria, dysphoria, constipation, and pruritus.



 Hypersensitivity reactions may include: Skin eruptions, urticarial, erythematous skin reactions. Hematologic reactions may include: thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, pancytopenia, hemolytic anemia. Rare cases of agranulocytosis has likewise been associated with acetaminophen use. In high doses, the most serious adverse effect is a dose-dependent, potentially fatal hepatic necrosis. Renal tubular necrosis and hypoglycemic coma also may occur.



 Other adverse reactions obtained from postmarketing experiences with oxycodone and acetaminophen are listed by organ system and in decreasing order of severity and/or frequency as follows:



   Body as a Whole:  Anaphylactoid reaction, allergic reaction, malaise, asthenia, fatigue, chest pain, fever, hypothermia, thirst, headache, increased sweating, accidental overdose, non-accidental overdose



   Cardiovascular:  Hypotension, hypertension, tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, palpitations, dysrhythmias

    BOXED WARNING: 

  

    WARNING: ADDICTION, ABUSE, AND MISUSE;   RISK EVALUATION AND MITIGATION STRATEGY (REMS)  ; LIFE-THREATENING RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION; ACCIDENTAL INGESTION; NEONATAL OPIOID WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME, CYTOCHROME P450 3A4 INTERACTION; HEPATOTOXICITY, and RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH BENZODIAZEPINES OR OTHER CNS DEPRESSANTS  



     Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse    



   PERCOCET exposes patients and other users to the risks of opioid addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess each patient's risk prior to prescribing PERCOCET, and monitor all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors and conditions [see   WARNINGS  ].  



     Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS):    



   To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a REMS for these products       [          see Warnings  ]      . Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to   



 *  complete a REMS-compliant education program, 
 *  counsel patients and/or their caregivers, with every prescription, on safe use, serious risks, storage, and disposal of these products, 
 *  emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide every time it is provided by their pharmacist, and 
 *  consider other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety. 
        Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression    
 

   Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of PERCOCET. Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of PERCOCET or following a dose increase [see   WARNINGS  ].  



     Accidental Ingestion    



   Accidental ingestion of PERCOCET, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of PERCOCET [see   WARNINGS  ].  



     Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome    



   Prolonged use of PERCOCET during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see   WARNINGS  ].       



     Cytochrome P450 3A4 Interaction    



   The concomitant use of PERCOCET with all cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may result in an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse reactions and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. In addition, discontinuation of a concomitantly used cytochrome P450 3A4 inducer may result in an increase in oxycodone plasma concentration. Monitor patients receiving PERCOCET and any CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer [see   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  ,   WARNINGS  ,   PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions  ].  



     Hepatotoxicity    



   Acetaminophen has been associated with cases of acute liver failure, at times resulting in liver transplant and death. Most of the cases of liver injury are associated with the use of acetaminophen at doses that exceed 4000 mg per day, and often involve more than one acetaminophen-containing product.  



     Risks From Concomitant Use With Benzodiazepines Or Other CNS Depressants    



   Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death [see   WARNINGS  ,   PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions  ].  



 *  Reserve concomitant prescribing of PERCOCET and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. 
 *  Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. 
 *  Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.

    <Section id="S3" name="precautions">    PRECAUTIONS



   Information for Patients/Caregivers



  Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (  Medication Guide  ).



  Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse  



 Inform patients that the use of PERCOCET, even when taken as recommended, can result in addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death [see   WARNINGS    ]. Instruct patients not to share PERCOCET with others and to take steps to protect PERCOCET from theft or misuse.



  Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression  



 Inform patients of the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression, including information that the risk is greatest when starting PERCOCET or when the dosage is increased, and that it can occur even at recommended dosages [see   WARNINGS    ]. Advise patients how to recognize respiratory depression and to seek medical attention if breathing difficulties develop.



  Accidental Ingestion  



 Inform patients that accidental ingestion, especially by children, may result in respiratory depression or death [see   WARNINGS    ]. Instruct patients to take steps to store PERCOCET securely and to dispose of unused PERCOCET by flushing tablets down the toilet. In the case of accidental ingestions, emergency medical care should be sought immediately.



  Interactions with Benzodiazepines and Other CNS Depressants  



 Inform patients and caregivers that potentially fatal additive effects may occur if PERCOCET are used with benzodiazepines and other CNS depressants, including alcohol, and not to use these concomitantly unless supervised by a health care provider [see   WARNINGS    ,   PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions    ].



  Serotonin Syndrome  



 Inform patients that opioids could cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition resulting from concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs. Warn patients of the symptoms of serotonin syndrome and to seek medical attention right away if symptoms develop. Instruct patients to inform their healthcare providers if they are taking, or plan to take serotonergic medications [see   PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions    ].



  Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) Interaction  



 Inform patients to avoid taking PERCOCET while using any drugs that inhibit monoamine oxidase. Patients should not start MAOIs while taking PERCOCET Tablets [see   PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions    ].



  Adrenal Insufficiency  



 Inform patients that opioids could cause adrenal insufficiency, a potentially life-threatening condition. Adrenal insufficiency may present with non-specific symptoms and signs such as nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. Advise patients to seek medical attention if they experience a constellation of these symptoms [see   WARNINGS    ].



  Important Administration Instructions  



 Instruct patients how to properly take PERCOCET [see   DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  ,   WARNINGS    ].



 Advise patients not to adjust the medication dose themselves and to consult with their healthcare provider prior to any dosage adjustment.



 Advise patients who are treated with PERCOCET for more than a few weeks not to abruptly discontinue the medication. Advise patients to consult with their physician for a gradual discontinuation dose schedule to taper off the medication.



  Maximum Daily Dose of Acetaminophen  



 Inform patients to not take more than 4000 milligrams of acetaminophen per day. Advise patients to call their prescriber if they take more than the recommended dose.



  Hypotension  



 Inform patients that PERCOCET may cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope. Instruct patients how to recognize symptoms of low blood pressure and how to reduce the risk of serious consequences should hypotension occur (e.g., sit or lie down, carefully rise from a sitting or lying position) [see   WARNINGS    ].



  Anaphylaxis  



 Inform patients that anaphylaxis have been reported with ingredients contained in PERCOCET. Advise patients how to recognize such a reaction and when to seek medical attention [see   CONTRAINDICATIONS    ,   ADVERSE REACTIONS    ] .  



  Pregnancy  



  Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome  



 Inform female patients of reproductive potential that prolonged use of PERCOCET during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated [see   WARNINGS    ,   PRECAUTIONS      ;     Pregnancy    ]



  Embryo-Fetal Toxicity  



 Inform female patients of reproductive potential that PERCOCET can cause fetal harm and to inform the healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy [see   PRECAUTIONS; Pregnancy    ].



  Lactation  



 Advise nursing mothers to monitor infants for increased sleepiness (more than usual), breathing difficulties, or limpness. Instruct nursing mothers to seek immediate medical care if they notice these signs [see   PRECAUTIONS; Nursing Mothers    ].



  Infertility  



 Inform patients that chronic use of opioids may cause reduced fertility. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see   ADVERSE REACTIONS    ] .  



  Driving or Operating Heavy Machinery  



 Inform patients that PERCOCET may impair the ability to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating heavy machinery.  Advise patients not to perform such tasks until they know how they will react to the medication [see   PRECAUTIONS    ].



  Constipation  



 Advise patients of the potential for severe constipation, including management instructions and when to seek medical attention [  see   ADVERSE REACTIONS    ,   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY     ]  .



  Disposal of Unused PERCOCET  



 Advise patients to dispose of unused PERCOCET by flushing unused tablets down the toilet.



    Laboratory Tests



  Although oxycodone may cross-react with some drug urine tests, no available studies were found which determined the duration of detectability of oxycodone in urine drug screens. However, based on pharmacokinetic data, the approximate duration of detectability for a single dose of oxycodone is roughly estimated to be one to two days following drug exposure.



 Urine testing for opiates may be performed to determine illicit drug use and for medical reasons such as evaluation of patients with altered states of consciousness or monitoring efficacy of drug rehabilitation efforts. The preliminary identification of opiates in urine involves the use of an immunoassay screening and thin-layer chromatography (TLC). Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) may be utilized as a third-stage identification step in the medical investigational sequence for opiate testing after immunoassay and TLC. The identities of 6-keto opiates (e.g., oxycodone) can further be differentiated by the analysis of their methoximetrimethylsilyl (MO-TMS) derivative.



    Drug Interactions



   Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6  



 The concomitant use of PERCOCET and CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), can increase the plasma concentration of oxycodone, resulting in increased or prolonged opioid effects. These effects could be more pronounced with concomitant use of PERCOCET and CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors, particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of PERCOCET is achieved [see   WARNINGS    ].



 After stopping a CYP3A4 inhibitor, as the effects of the inhibitor decline, the oxycodone plasma concentration will decrease [see   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY    ], resulting in decreased opioid efficacy or a withdrawal syndrome in patients who had developed physical dependence to PERCOCET.



 If concomitant use is necessary, consider dosage reduction of PERCOCET until stable drug effects are achieved. Monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals. If a CYP3A4 inhibitor is discontinued, consider increasing the PERCOCET dosage until stable drug effects are achieved.



 Monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal.



  Inducers of CYP3A4  



 The concomitant use of PERCOCET and CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, can decrease the plasma concentration of oxycodone [see   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY    ], resulting in decreased efficacy or onset of a withdrawal syndrome in patients who have developed physical dependence to PERCOCET [see   WARNINGS    ].



 After stopping a CYP3A4 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the oxycodone plasma concentration will increase [see   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY    ], which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic effects and adverse reactions, and may cause serious respiratory depression.



 If concomitant use is necessary, consider increasing the PERCOCET dosage until stable drug effects are achieved. Monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal. If a CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued, consider PERCOCET dosage reduction and monitor for signs of respiratory depression.



  Benzodiazepines and Other CNS Depressants  



 Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines and other CNS depressants such as benzodiazepines and other sedative hypnotics, anxiolytics, and tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, and other opioids, including alcohol, can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death.



 Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients closely for signs of respiratory depression and sedation [see   WARNINGS    ].



  Serotonergic Drugs  



 The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), tryptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue), has resulted in serotonin syndrome. [see   PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients/Caregivers    ].



 If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue PERCOCET if serotonin syndrome is suspected.



  Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)  



 The concomitant use of opioids and MAOIs, such as phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid, may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma) [see   WARNINGS    ].



 The use of PERCOCET is not recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment.



 If urgent use of an opioid is necessary, use test doses and frequent titration of small doses to treat pain while closely monitoring blood pressure and signs and symptoms of CNS and respiratory depression.



  Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics  



 The concomitant use of opioids with other opioid analgesics, such as butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, may reduce the analgesic effect of PERCOCET and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.



 Advise patient to avoid concomitant use of these drugs.



  Muscle Relaxants  



 PERCOCET may enhance the neuromuscular-blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increase in the degree of respiratory depression.



 If concomitant use is warranted, monitor patients for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected and decrease the dosage of PERCOCET and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary.



  Diuretics  



 Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone.



 If concomitant use is warranted, monitor patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed.



  Anticholinergic Drugs  



 The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus.



 If concomitant use is warranted, monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when PERCOCET is used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs.



  Alcohol, ethyl  



 Hepatotoxicity has occurred in chronic alcoholics following various dose levels (moderate to excessive) of acetaminophen.



  Oral Contraceptives  



 Increase in glucuronidation resulting in increased plasma clearance and a decreased half-life of acetaminophen.



  Charcoal (activated)  



 Reduces acetaminophen absorption when administered as soon as possible after overdose.



  Beta Blockers (Propranolol)  



 Propranolol appears to inhibit the enzyme systems responsible for the glucuronidation and oxidation of acetaminophen. Therefore, the pharmacologic effects of acetaminophen may be increased.



  Loop Diuretics  



 The effects of the loop diuretic may be decreased because acetaminophen may decrease renal prostaglandin excretion and decrease plasma renin activity.



  Lamotrigine  



 Serum lamotrigine concentrations may be reduced, producing a decrease in therapeutic effects.



  Probenecid  



 Probenecid may increase the therapeutic effectiveness of acetaminophen slightly.



  Zidovudine  



 The pharmacologic effects of zidovudine may be decreased because of enhanced non-hepatic or renal clearance of zidovudine.



    Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions



  Depending on the sensitivity/specificity and the test methodology, the individual components of PERCOCET may cross-react with assays used in the preliminary detection of cocaine (primary urinary metabolite, benzoylecgonine) or marijuana (cannabinoids) in human urine. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. The preferred confirmatory method is gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Moreover, clinical considerations and professional judgment should be applied to any drug-of-abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are used.



 Acetaminophen may interfere with home blood glucose measurement systems; decreases of &gt;20% in mean glucose values may be noted. This effect appears to be drug, concentration and system dependent.



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility



   Carcinogenesis  



 Long-term studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of the combination of Oxycodone Hydrochloride and Acetaminophen have not been conducted.



 Long-term studies in mice and rats have been completed by the National Toxicology Program to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of acetaminophen. In 2-year feeding studies, F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were fed a diet containing acetaminophen up to 6000 ppm. Female rats demonstrated equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity based on increased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia at 0.8 times the maximum human daily dose (MHDD) of 4 grams/day, based on a body surface area comparison.  In contrast, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity in male rats that received up to 0.7 times or mice at up to 1.2-1.4 times the MHDD, based on a body surface area comparison.



  Mutagenesis  



 The combination of Oxycodone Hydrochloride and Acetaminophen has not been evaluated for mutagenicity. Oxycodone alone was negative in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames), an in vitro  chromosome aberration assay with human lymphocytes without metabolic activation and an in vivo  mouse micronucleus assay. Oxycodone was clastogenic in the human lymphocyte chromosomal assay in the presence of metabolic activation and in the mouse lymphoma assay with or without metabolic activation.



 In the published literature, acetaminophen has been reported to be clastogenic when administered at 1500 mg/kg/day to the rat model (3.6-times the MHDD, based on a body surface area comparison). In contrast, no clastogenicity was noted at a dose of 750 mg/kg/day (1.8-times the MHDD, based on a body surface area comparison), suggesting a threshold effect.



  Impairment of Fertility  



 In studies conducted by the National Toxicology Program, fertility assessments with acetaminophen have been completed in Swiss CD-1 mice via a continuous breeding study.  There were no effects on fertility parameters in mice consuming up to 1.7 times the MHDD of acetaminophen, based on a body surface area comparison. Although there was no effect on sperm motility or sperm density in the epididymis, there was a significant increase in the percentage of abnormal sperm in mice consuming 1.78 times the MHDD (based on a body surface comparison) and there was a reduction in the number of mating pairs



 producing a fifth litter at this dose, suggesting the potential for cumulative toxicity with chronic administration of acetaminophen near the upper limit of daily dosing.



 Published studies in rodents report that oral acetaminophen treatment of male animals at doses that are 1.2 times the MHDD and greater (based on a body surface comparison) result in decreased testicular weights, reduced spermatogenesis, reduced fertility, and reduced implantation sites in females given the same doses. These effects appear to increase with the duration of treatment. The clinical significance of these findings is not known.



  Infertility  



 Chronic use of opioids may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see   ADVERSE REACTIONS    ].



    Pregnancy



    Teratogenic Effects  



    Pregnancy Category C  



  Animal reproductive studies have not been conducted with PERCOCET. It is also not known whether PERCOCET can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity. PERCOCET should not be given to a pregnant woman unless in the judgment of the physician, the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards.



     Nonteratogenic Effects  



   Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions  



 Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth.



 Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly [see   WARNINGS    ].



    Labor or Delivery



  Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. PERCOCET is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including PERCOCET, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression.



    Nursing Mothers



  Ordinarily, nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is receiving PERCOCET because of the possibility of sedation and/or respiratory depression in the infant. Oxycodone is excreted in breast milk in low concentrations, and there have been rare reports of somnolence and lethargy in babies of nursing mothers taking an oxycodone/acetaminophen product.



 Acetaminophen is also excreted in breast milk in low concentrations.



 The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for PERCOCET and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from PERCOCET or from the underlying maternal condition.



 Infants exposed to PERCOCET through breast milk should be monitored for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breast-feeding is stopped.



    Pediatric Use



  Safety and effectiveness of PERCOCET in pediatric patients have not been established.



    Geriatric Use



  Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity PERCOCET. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.



 Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co- administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of PERCOCET slowly in geriatric patients and monitor closely for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [see   WARNINGS    ].



 These drugs are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.



    Hepatic Impairment



  In a pharmacokinetic study of oxycodone in patients with end-stage liver disease, oxycodone plasma clearance decreased and the elimination half-life increased.



 Because oxycodone is extensively metabolized in the liver, its clearance may decrease in patients with hepatic impairment. Initiate therapy in these patients with a lower than usual dosage of PERCOCET and titrate carefully. Monitor closely for adverse events such as respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension [see   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY    ].



    Renal Impairment



  In a study of patients with end stage renal impairment, mean elimination half-life was prolonged in uremic patients due to increased volume of distribution and reduced clearance. Oxycodone should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment.



 Because oxycodone is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, its clearance may decrease in patients with renal impairment. Initiate therapy with a lower than usual dosage of PERCOCET and titrate carefully. Monitor closely for adverse events such as respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension [see   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY    ]. 
</Section>
    <Section id="S4" name="warnings">    WARNINGS



   Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse



  PERCOCET contains oxycodone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, PERCOCET exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see   DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE    ].



 Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed PERCOCET. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused.



 Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing PERCOCET, and monitor all patients receiving PERCOCET for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as PERCOCET, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of PERCOCET along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse.



 Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing PERCOCET. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see   PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients/Caregivers    ]. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.



    Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)



  To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to do all of the following:



 *  Complete a REMS-compliant education program offered by an accredited provider of continuing education (CE) or another education program that includes all the elements of the FDA Education Blueprint for Health Care Providers Involved in the Management or Support of Patients with Pain. 
 *  Discuss the safe use, serious risks, and proper storage and disposal of opioid analgesics with patients and/or their caregivers every time these medicines are prescribed. The Patient Counseling Guide (PCG) can be obtained at this link:   www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSPCG   . 
 *  Emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide that they will receive from their pharmacist every time an opioid analgesic is dispensed to them. 
 *  Consider using other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety, such as patient-prescriber agreements that reinforce patient-prescriber responsibilities. 
    To obtain further information on the opioid analgesic REMS and for a list of accredited REMS CME/CE, call 800-503-0784, or log on to www.opioidanalgesicrems.com  . The FDA Blueprint can be found at   www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSBlueprint    .
 

    Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression



  Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see   OVERDOSAGE    ]. Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. 



 While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of PERCOCET, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24 to 72 hours of initiating therapy with and following dosage increases of PERCOCET. 



 To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of PERCOCET are essential [see   DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION    ]. Overestimating the PERCOCET dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose. 



 Accidental ingestion of PERCOCET, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of PERCOCET.



    Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome



  Prolonged use of PERCOCET during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see   PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients/Caregivers, Pregnancy    ].



    Risks of Concomitant Use or Discontinuation of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers



  Concomitant use of PERCOCET with a CYP3A4 inhibitor, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may increase plasma concentrations of oxycodone hydrochloride and prolong opioid adverse reactions, which may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression [see   WARNINGS    ], particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of PERCOCET is achieved .  Similarly, discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inducer, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, in PERCOCET-treated patients may increase oxycodone plasma concentrations and prolong opioid adverse reactions. When using PERCOCET with CYP3A4 inhibitors or discontinuing CYP3A4 inducers in PERCOCET-treated patients, monitor patients closely at frequent intervals and consider dosage reduction of PERCOCET until stable drug effects are achieved [see   PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions    ].



 Concomitant use of PERCOCET with CYP3A4 inducers or discontinuation of an CYP3A4 inhibitor could decrease oxycodone hydrochloride plasma concentrations, decrease opioid efficacy or, possibly, lead to a withdrawal syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone hydrochloride. When using PERCOCET with CYP3A4 inducers or discontinuing CYP3A4 inhibitors, monitor patients closely at frequent intervals and consider increasing the opioid dosage if needed to maintain adequate analgesia or if symptoms of opioid withdrawal occur [see   PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions    ].



    Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants



  Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of PERCOCET with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.



 Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone.  Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see   PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions    ].



 If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.



 Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when PERCOCET is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs).  Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs.



    Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients



  The use of PERCOCET in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated.



  Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease:  PERCOCET-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of PERCOCET [see   WARNINGS; Life Threatening Respiratory Depression    ].



  Elderly, Cachetic, or Debilitated Patients:  Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see   WARNINGS; Life Threatening Respiratory Depression    ].



 Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating PERCOCET and when PERCOCET is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see   WARNINGS; Life Threatening Respiratory Depression    ]. Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients.



    Adrenal Insufficiency



  Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.



    Severe Hypotension



  PERCOCET may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see   PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions    ]. Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of PERCOCET. In patients with circulatory shock PERCOCET may cause vasodilatation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of PERCOCET with circulatory shock.



    Hepatotoxicity



  Acetaminophen has been associated with cases of acute liver failure, at times resulting in liver transplant and death. Most of the cases of liver injury are associated with the use of acetaminophen at doses that exceed 4000 milligrams per day, and often involve more than one acetaminophen-containing product. The excessive intake of acetaminophen may be intentional to cause self-harm or unintentional as patients attempt to obtain more pain relief or unknowingly take other acetaminophen-containing products.



 The risk of acute liver failure is higher in individuals with underlying liver disease and in individuals who ingest alcohol while taking acetaminophen.



 Instruct patients to look for acetaminophen or APAP on package labels and not to use more than one product that contains acetaminophen. Instruct patients to seek medical attention immediately upon ingestion of more than 4000 milligrams of acetaminophen per day, even if they feel well.



     Serious Skin Reactions  



  Rarely, acetaminophen may cause serious skin reactions such as acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. Patients should be informed about the signs of serious skin reactions, and use of the drug should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity.



    Hypersensitivity/Anaphylaxis



  There have been post-marketing reports of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis associated with use of acetaminophen. Clinical signs included swelling of the face, mouth, and throat, respiratory distress, urticaria, rash, pruritus, and vomiting. There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergency medical attention. Instruct patients to discontinue PERCOCET immediately and seek medical care if they experience these symptoms. Do not prescribe PERCOCET for patients with acetaminophen allergy [see   PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients/Caregivers    ].



    Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness



  In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), PERCOCET may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with PERCOCET. 



 Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury.  Avoid the use of PERCOCET in patients with impaired consciousness or coma.



    Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions



  PERCOCET are contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus. 



 The administration of PERCOCET, or other opioids may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal conditions.



 The oxycodone in PERCOCET may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms.



    Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders



  The oxycodone in PERCOCET may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during PERCOCET therapy.



    Withdrawal



  Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including PERCOCET. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.



 When discontinuing PERCOCET, gradually taper the dosage [see   DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION    ]. Do not abruptly discontinue PERCOCET [see   DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE    ].



    Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery



  PERCOCET may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery.  Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of PERCOCET and know how they will react to the medication [see   PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients/Caregivers    ].
