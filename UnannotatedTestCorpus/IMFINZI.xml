  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The data described in the Warnings and Precautions section reflect exposure to IMFINZI in 1889 patients from the PACIFIC study (a randomized, placebo-controlled study that enrolled 475 patients with Stage III NSCLC), Study 1108 (an open-label, single-arm, multicohort study that enrolled 191 patients with urothelial carcinoma and 779 patients with various other solid tumors), and an additional open-label, single-arm trial that enrolled 444 patients with metastatic lung cancer, an indication for which durvalumab is not approved. Across all studies, IMFINZI was administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks. Among the 1889 patients, 38% were exposed for 6 months or more and 18% were exposed for 12 months or more.



 The data described in this section reflect exposure to IMFINZI in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma enrolled in Study 1108 and in patients with Stage III NSCLC enrolled in the PACIFIC study.



   Urothelial Carcinoma  



 The safety data described in Table 2 reflect exposure to IMFINZI in 182 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma in the urothelial carcinoma cohort of Study 1108 whose disease has progressed during or after one standard platinum-based regimen. Patients received IMFINZI 10 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks  [see  Clinical Studies (14.1)  ]  . The median duration of exposure was 2.3 months (range: 1 day to 12.1 months).



 Thirty-one percent (31%) of patients had a drug delay or interruption for an adverse reaction. The most common (&gt; 2%) were liver injury (4.9%), urinary tract infection (3.3%), acute kidney injury (3.3%), and musculoskeletal pain (2.7%).



 The most common adverse reactions (&gt;= 15%) were fatigue (39%), musculoskeletal pain (24%), constipation (21%), decreased appetite (19%), nausea (16%), peripheral edema (15%) and urinary tract infection (15%). The most common Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions (&gt;= 3%) were fatigue, urinary tract infection, musculoskeletal pain, abdominal pain, dehydration, and general physical health deterioration.



 Eight patients (4.4%) who were treated with IMFINZI experienced Grade 5 adverse reactions of cardiorespiratory arrest, general physical health deterioration, sepsis, ileus, pneumonitis, or immune-mediated hepatitis. Three additional patients were experiencing infection and disease progression at the time of death. IMFINZI was discontinued for adverse reactions in 3.3% of patients. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 46% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions (&gt; 2%) were acute kidney injury (4.9%), urinary tract infection (4.4%), musculoskeletal pain (4.4%), liver injury (3.3%), general physical health deterioration (3.3%), sepsis, abdominal pain and pyrexia/tumor associated fever (2.7% each).



 Table 2 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred in &gt;= 10% of patients, while Table 3 summarizes the Grade 3 - 4 laboratory abnormalities that occurred in &gt;= 1% of patients treated with IMFINZI in the urothelial carcinoma cohort of Study 1108.

 The safety of IMFINZI in patients with Stage III NSCLC who completed concurrent platinum-based chemoradiotherapy within 42 days prior to initiation of study drug was evaluated in the PACIFIC study, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. A total of 475 patients received IMFINZI 10 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks. The study excluded patients who had disease progression following chemoradiation, with active or prior autoimmune disease within 2 years of initiation of the study or with medical conditions that required systemic immunosuppression  [see  Clinical Studies (14.2)  ]  .



 The study population characteristics were: median age of 64 years (range: 23 to 90), 45% age 65 years or older, 70% male, 69% White, 27% Asian, 75% former smoker, 16% current smoker, and 51% had WHO performance status of 1. All patients received definitive radiotherapy as per protocol, of which 92% received a total radiation dose of 54 Gy to 66 Gy. The median duration of exposure to IMFINZI was 10 months (range: 0.2 to 12.6).



 IMFINZI was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 15% of patients. The most common adverse reactions leading to IMFINZI discontinuation were pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis in 6% of patients. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 29% of patients receiving IMFINZI. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients were pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis (7%) and pneumonia (6%). Fatal pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis and fatal pneumonia occurred in &lt; 2% of patients and were similar across arms. The most common adverse reactions (occurring in &gt;= 20% of patients) were cough, fatigue, pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis, upper respiratory tract infections, dyspnea and rash.

             6.2 Immunogenicity
   As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to durvalumab to the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.



 Due to the limitations in assay performance, the incidence of antibody development in patients receiving IMFINZI may be underestimated. Of 1570 patients who were treated with IMFINZI 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks and evaluable for the presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), 45 (2.9%) patients tested positive for treatment-emergent ADAs. The development of treatment-emergent ADA against durvalumab appears to have no clinically relevant effect on its pharmacokinetic profile. There are insufficient numbers of patients with ADA to determine whether ADA alters the safety or efficacy of durvalumab.

    5.1 Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis  



   IMFINZI can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, defined as requiring use of corticosteroids. Fatal cases have been reported.  



  Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate patients with suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids, prednisone 1 to 2 mg per kg per day or equivalent for moderate (Grade 2) pneumonitis or prednisone 1 to 4 mg per kg per day or equivalent for more severe (Grade 3-4) pneumonitis, followed by taper. Interrupt or permanently discontinue IMFINZI based on the severity [see       Dosage and Administration (2.3)   ]     .  



  In clinical studies enrolling 1889 patients with various cancers who received IMFINZI [see       Adverse Reactions (6.1)   ]     , pneumonitis occurred in 5% of patients, including Grade 3 (0.8%), Grade 4 (&lt; 0.1%) and Grade 5 (0.3%) immune-mediated pneumonitis. The median time to onset was 1.8 months (range: 1 day to 13.9 months) and the median time to resolution was 4.9 months (range: 0 days to 13.7 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of IMFINZI in 1.5% of the 1889 patients. Pneumonitis resolved in 54% of patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 3.5% of the 1889 patients, with 2.5% requiring high-dose corticosteroids (prednisone &gt;= 40 mg per day or equivalent) and 0.1% requiring infliximab.  



  The incidence of pneumonitis (including radiation pneumonitis) was higher in patients in the PACIFIC study who completed treatment with definitive chemoradiation within 42 days prior to initiation of IMFINZI (34%) compared to patients in other clinical studies (2.3%) in which radiation therapy was generally not administered immediately prior to initiation of IMFINZI.  



  In the PACIFIC study, the incidence of Grade 3 pneumonitis was 3.4% and of Grade 5 pneumonitis was 1.1% in the IMFINZI arm. The median time to onset of pneumonitis was 1.8 months and the median duration was 2.1 months (range: 3 days to 18.7 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of IMFINZI in 6% of patients. Pneumonitis resolved in 47% of patients experiencing pneumonitis. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 21% of patients, with 12% requiring high-dose corticosteroids and 0.1% requiring infliximab.  



     5.2 Immune-Mediated Hepatitis     



   IMFINZI can cause immune-mediated hepatitis, defined as requiring use of corticosteroids. Fatal cases have been reported.  



  Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hepatitis, during and after discontinuation of IMFINZI, including clinical chemistry monitoring. Administer corticosteroids, prednisone 1 to 2 mg per kg per day or equivalent, followed by taper for Grade 2 or higher elevations of ALT, AST, and/or total bilirubin. Interrupt or permanently discontinue IMFINZI based on the severity [see       Dosage and Administration (2.3)   ]     .  



  In clinical studies enrolling 1889 patients with various cancers who received IMFINZI [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], hepatitis occurred in 12% of patients, including Grade 3 (4.4%), Grade 4 (0.4%) and Grade 5 (0.2%) immune-mediated hepatitis. The median time to onset was 1.2 months (range: 1 day to 13.6 months). Hepatitis led to discontinuation of IMFINZI in 0.7% of the 1889 patients. Hepatitis resolved in 49% of patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 2.7% of patients, with 1.7% requiring high-dose corticosteroids and 0.1% requiring mycophenolate.

  Hypopituitarism leading to adrenal insufficiency and diabetes insipidus occurred in &lt; 0.1% of 1889 patients who received IMFINZI in clinical studies.  



     5.5 Immune-Mediated Nephritis     



   IMFINZI can cause immune-mediated nephritis defined as evidence of renal dysfunction, requirement for corticosteroids. Fatal cases have occurred.  



  Monitor patients for abnormal renal function tests prior to and periodically during treatment with IMFINZI. Initiate prednisone 1 to 2 mg per kg per day or equivalent, for moderate (Grade 2) or severe (Grade 3-4) nephritis, followed by taper. Interrupt or permanently discontinue IMFINZI based on the severity [see       Dosage and Administration (2.3)   ]     .  



  In clinical studies enrolling 1889 patients with various cancers who received IMFINZI [see       Adverse Reactions (6.1)   ]     , nephritis (reported as any of the following increased creatinine or urea, acute kidney injury, renal failure, decreased glomerular filtration rate, tubulointerstitial nephritis, decreased creatinine clearance, glomerulonephritis, and nephritis) occurred in 6.3% of patients including Grade 3 (1.1%), Grade 4 (0.2%) and Grade 5 (0.1%) immune-mediated nephritis. The median time to onset was 2 months (range: 1 day to 14.2 months). IMFINZI was discontinued in 0.3% of the 1889 patients. Nephritis resolved in 50% of patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 0.6% of patients, with 0.4% receiving high-dose corticosteroids.  



     5.6 Immune-Mediated Dermatologic Reactions     



   IMFINZI can cause immune-mediated rash; bullous dermatitis, Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have occurred with other products in this class [see       Warnings and Precautions (5.7)   ]     .  



  Monitor for signs and symptoms of rash. Initiate prednisone 1 to 2 mg per kg per day or equivalent, for moderate (Grade 2) rash or dermatitis lasting for more than 1 week or severe (Grade 3-4) rash or dermatitis followed by taper. Interrupt or permanently discontinue IMFINZI based on the severity [see       Dosage and Administration (2.3)   ]     .  



  In clinical studies enrolling 1889 patients with various cancers who received IMFINZI [see       Adverse Reactions (6.1)   ]     , 26% of patients developed rash or dermatitis and 0.4% of the patients developed vitiligo. Rash or dermatitis led to discontinuation of IMFINZI in 0.1% of the 1889 patients. Rash resolved in 62% of patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 2.0% of patients, including high-dose corticosteroids in 1% of patients.  



     5.7 Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions     



   IMFINZI can cause severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions. These immune-mediated reactions may involve any organ system. While immune-mediated reactions usually manifest during treatment with IMFINZI, immune-mediated adverse reactions can also manifest after discontinuation of IMFINZI.  



  For suspected Grade 2 immune-mediated adverse reactions, exclude other causes and initiate corticosteroids as clinically indicated. For severe (Grade 3 or 4) adverse reactions, administer corticosteroids, prednisone 1 to 4 mg per kg per day or equivalent, followed by taper. Interrupt or permanently discontinue IMFINZI, based on the severity of the reaction [see       Dosage and Administration (2.3)   ]     . If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, evaluate for Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome, which has been observed with other products in this class and may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss.  



  The following clinically significant, immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of less than 1% each in 1889 patients who received IMFINZI: aseptic meningitis, hemolytic anemia, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, myocarditis, myositis, and ocular inflammatory toxicity, including uveitis and keratitis [see       Adverse Reactions (6.1)   ]     . The following clinically significant, immune-mediated adverse reactions have been reported with other products in this class: bullous dermatitis, Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), pancreatitis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, rhabdomyolysis, myasthenia gravis, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis, demyelination, vasculitis, hemolytic anemia, iritis, encephalitis, facial and abducens nerve paresis, demyelination, polymyalgia rheumatica, autoimmune neuropathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome.  



     5.8 Infection     



   IMFINZI can cause serious infections, including fatal cases.  



  Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection. For Grade 3 or higher infections, withhold IMFINZI and resume once clinically stable [see       Dosage and Administration (2.3)   ]     .  



  In clinical studies enrolling 1889 patients with various cancers who received IMFINZI [see       Adverse Reactions (6.1)   ]     , infections occurred in 43% of patients, including Grade 3 (8%), Grade 4 (1.9%), and Grade 5 (1.0%). In the urothelial carcinoma cohort in Study 1108 the most common Grade 3 or higher infection was urinary tract infections, which occurred in 4% of patients. In the PACIFIC study the most common Grade 3 or higher infection was pneumonia, which occurred in 5% of patients. The overall incidence of infections in IMFINZI-treated patients (56%) in the PACIFIC study was higher compared to patients in other studies (38%) in which radiation therapy was generally not administered immediately prior to initiation of IMFINZI.  



     5.9 Infusion-Related Reactions     



   IMFINZI can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions.  



  Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt, slow the rate of, or permanently discontinue IMFINZI based on the severity [see       Dosage and Administration (2.3)   ]     . For Grade 1 or 2 infusion-related reactions, consider using pre-medications with subsequent doses.  



  In clinical studies enrolling 1889 patients with various cancers [see       Adverse Reactions (6.1)   ]     , infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.2% of patients, including Grade 3 (0.3%).  



     5.10 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity     



   Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal studies, IMFINZI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of durvalumab to cynomolgus monkeys from the onset of organogenesis through delivery resulted in increased premature delivery, fetal loss and premature neonatal death. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with IMFINZI and for at least 3 months after the last dose of IMFINZI [see Use in Specific Populations (       8.1   ,    8.3   )].
