  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The safety of PRALUENT was evaluated in 9 placebo-controlled trials that included 2476 patients treated with PRALUENT 75 mg and/or 150 mg every 2 weeks, including 2135 exposed for 6 months and 1999 exposed for more than 1 year (median treatment duration of 65 weeks). The mean age of the population was 59 years, 40% of the population were women, 90% were Caucasians, 4% were Black or African American, and 3% were Asians. At baseline, 37% of patients had a diagnosis of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and 66% had clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.



 Adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of PRALUENT-treated patients, and more frequently than in placebo-treated patients, are shown in Table 1.

         Adverse reactions led to discontinuation of treatment in 5.3% of patients treated with PRALUENT and 5.1% of patients treated with placebo. The most common adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation in patients treated with PRALUENT were allergic reactions (0.6% versus 0.2% for PRALUENT and placebo, respectively) and elevated liver enzymes (0.3% versus &lt;0.1%).
 

     Local Injection Site Reactions  



 In a pool of placebo-controlled trials evaluating PRALUENT 75 mg and/or 150 mg administered every 2 weeks (Q2W), local injection site reactions including erythema/redness, itching, swelling, and pain/tenderness were reported more frequently in patients treated with PRALUENT (7.2% versus 5.1% for PRALUENT and placebo, respectively). Few patients discontinued treatment because of these reactions (0.2% versus 0.4% for PRALUENT and placebo, respectively), but patients receiving PRALUENT had a greater number of injection site reactions, had more reports of associated symptoms, and had reactions of longer average duration than patients receiving placebo.



 In a 48-week placebo-controlled trial evaluating PRALUENT 300 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) and 75 mg Q2W, in which all patients received an injection of drug or placebo every 2 weeks to maintain the blind, local injection site reactions were reported more frequently in patients treated with PRALUENT 300 mg Q4W as compared to those receiving PRALUENT 75 mg Q2W or placebo (16.6%, 9.6%, and 7.9%, respectively). Three patients (0.7%) treated with PRALUENT 300 mg Q4W discontinued treatment due to local injection site reactions versus no patients (0%) in the other 2 treatment groups.



     Allergic Reactions  



 Allergic reactions were reported more frequently in patients treated with PRALUENT than in those treated with placebo (8.6% versus 7.8%). The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to allergic reactions was higher among those treated with PRALUENT (0.6% versus 0.2%). Serious allergic reactions, such as hypersensitivity, nummular eczema, and hypersensitivity vasculitis were reported in patients using PRALUENT in controlled clinical trials [  see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)    ].



     Neurocognitive Events  



 Neurocognitive events were reported in 0.8% of patients treated with PRALUENT and 0.7% of patients treated with placebo. Confusion or memory impairment were reported more frequently by those treated with PRALUENT (0.2% for each) than in those treated with placebo (&lt;0.1% for each).



     Liver Enzyme Abnormalities  



 Liver-related disorders (primarily related to abnormalities in liver enzymes) were reported in 2.5% of patients treated with PRALUENT and 1.8% of patients treated with placebo, leading to treatment discontinuation in 0.4% and 0.2% of patients, respectively. Increases in serum transaminases to greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal occurred in 1.7% of patients treated with PRALUENT and 1.4% of patients treated with placebo.



     Low LDL-C Values  



 In the placebo-controlled and active-controlled clinical trials using an every 2 week or every 4 week dosing interval, 914 PRALUENT-treated patients had two consecutive calculated LDL-C values &lt;25 mg/dL, and 335 had two consecutive calculated LDL-C values &lt;15 mg/dL. LDL-C values &lt;25 mg/dL and &lt;15 mg/dL were observed more frequently in patients treated with the PRALUENT 150 mg Q2W or 300 mg Q4W dosing regimens. Changes to background lipid-altering therapy (e.g., maximally tolerated statins) were not made in response to low LDL-C values, and PRALUENT dosing was not modified or interrupted on this basis.



 Although adverse consequences of very low LDL-C were not identified in these trials, the long-term effects of very low levels of LDL-C induced by PRALUENT are unknown.



   6.2 Immunogenicity

  As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity with PRALUENT. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to PRALUENT in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading.



 In a pool of ten placebo-controlled and active-controlled trials, 4.8% (147/3033) of patients treated with PRALUENT 75 mg and/or 150 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) had anti-drug antibodies (ADA) newly detected at least once after initiating treatment compared with 0.6% (10/1708) of patients treated with control. For 1.9% (57/3033) of patients treated with PRALUENT and 0.5% (8/1708) of patients treated with control, ADA were detected in at least 2 samples separated by at least 12 weeks or were detected only at the last sampling time point. Patients treated with PRALUENT 75 mg and/or 150 mg Q2W who ever developed ADA had a higher incidence of injection site reactions compared with patients who never had ADA detected (10.2% vs 5.9%).



 In the same pool, 1.2% (36/3033) of patients treated with PRALUENT 75 mg and/or 150 mg Q2W had neutralizing antibodies (NAb) detected at least once, and 0.3% (9/3033) exhibited some attenuation in efficacy. No patients treated with control developed NAb. The long-term consequences of continuing PRALUENT treatment in the presence of persistent NAb are unknown.



 In a separate clinical study of patients treated with PRALUENT 75 mg Q2W or 300 mg every 4 weeks (including some patients with dose adjustment to 150 mg Q2W), the incidence of detecting ADA and NAb was qualitatively similar to the results from the pooled trials described above.



   6.3 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been reported during postapproval use of PRALUENT. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

  EXCERPT:   Allergic Reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., pruritus, rash, urticaria), including some serious events (e.g., hypersensitivity vasculitis and hypersensitivity reactions requiring hospitalization), have been reported with PRALUENT treatment. If signs or symptoms of serious allergic reactions occur, discontinue treatment with PRALUENT, treat according to the standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. (  5.1  )



 



   5.1 Allergic Reactions



  Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., pruritus, rash, urticaria), including some serious events (e.g., hypersensitivity vasculitis and hypersensitivity reactions requiring hospitalization), have been reported with PRALUENT treatment. If signs or symptoms of serious allergic reactions occur, discontinue treatment with PRALUENT, treat according to the standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve [ see  Contraindications (4)    ].
