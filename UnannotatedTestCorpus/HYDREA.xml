  The following adverse reactions are described in detail in other labeling sections:



 *    Myelosuppression [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  
 *    Malignancies [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]  
 *    Embryo-fetal toxicity [see  Boxed Warning  and  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  
 *    Vasculitic toxicities [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.4)  ]  
 *    Risks with concomitant use of antiretroviral drugs [    see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)    ]  
 *    Macrocytosis [    see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)    ]  
    Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.
 

   EXCERPT:   Most common adverse reactions (&gt;=30%) are hematological, gastrointestinal symptoms, and anorexia.  (6)  



 To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Bristol-Myers Squibb at 1-800-721-5072 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or    www.fda.gov/medwatch.    



 

  6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

  In 299 patients treated for sickle cell anemia in the Multicenter Study of Hydroxyurea in Sickle Cell Anemia, the most common adverse reactions were hematologic, with neutropenia, and low reticulocyte and platelet levels necessitating temporary cessation in almost all patients. Hematologic recovery usually occurred in two weeks.



 Other adverse reactions include hair loss, macrocytosis, bleeding, and melanonychia.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of hydroxyurea in the treatment of neoplastic diseases. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency.



 *   Reproductive System and Breast disorders: azoospermia, and oligospermia 
 *   Gastrointestinal disorders: stomatitis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation 
 *   Metabolism and Nutrition disorders: anorexia 
 *   Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: maculopapular rash, skin ulceration, dermatomyositis-like skin changes, peripheral and facial erythema, hyperpigmentation, nail hyperpigmentation, atrophy of skin and nails, scaling, violet papules, and alopecia 
 *   Renal and urinary disorders: dysuria, elevations in serum uric acid, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine levels 
 *   Nervous system disorders: headache, dizziness, drowsiness, disorientation, hallucinations, and convulsions 
 *   General disorders: fever, chills, malaise, edema, and asthenia 
 *   Hepatobiliary disorders: elevation of hepatic enzymes, cholestasis, and hepatitis 
 *   Respiratory disorders: diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, dyspnea, and pulmonary fibrosis 
 *  Hypersensitivity: Drug-induced fever (pyrexia) (&gt;39 degrees C, &gt;102 degrees F) requiring hospitalization has been reported concurrently with gastrointestinal, pulmonary, musculoskeletal, hepatobiliary, dermatological or cardiovascular manifestations. Onset typically occurred within 6 weeks of initiation and resolved upon discontinuation of hydroxyurea. Upon re-administration fever re-occurred typically within 24 hours.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: MYELOSUPPRESSION AND MALIGNANCIES 

  WARNING: MYELOSUPPRESSION AND MALIGNANCIES 

      Myelosuppression:   DROXIA may cause severe myelosuppression. Monitor blood counts at baseline and throughout treatment. Interrupt treatment and reduce dose as necessary   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  .  



     Malignancies:   Hydroxyurea is carcinogenic. Advise sun protection and monitor patients for malignancies   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]  .  



   EXCERPT:   WARNING: MYELOSUPPRESSION AND MALIGNANCIES



   See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.  



   Myelosuppression  : DROXIA may cause severe myelosuppression. Do not give if bone marrow function is markedly depressed. Monitor blood counts at baseline and throughout treatment. Interrupt treatment and reduce dose as necessary.   (5.1)    Malignancies    :   Hydroxyurea is carcinogenic. Advise sun protection and monitor patients for malignancies.   (5.2)

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *    Embryo-Fetal toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise of potential risk to a fetus and use of effective contraception.  (5.3  ,  8.1  ,  8.3)   
 *    Vasculitic toxicities: Institute treatment and discontinue DROXIA if this occurs.  (5.4)   
 *    Live Vaccinations: Avoid live vaccine use in a patient taking DROXIA.  (5.5)   
 *    Risks with concomitant use of antiretroviral drugs: Pancreatitis, hepatotoxicity, and neuropathy have occurred. Monitor for signs and symptoms in patients with HIV infection using antiretroviral drugs; discontinue DROXIA, and implement treatment.  (5.6)   
    
 

   5.1 Myelosuppression



  Hydroxyurea causes severe myelosuppression. Treatment with hydroxyurea should not be initiated if bone marrow function is markedly depressed. Bone marrow suppression may occur, and leukopenia is generally its first and most common manifestation. Thrombocytopenia and anemia occur less often, and are seldom seen without a preceding leukopenia.



 Some patients, treated at the recommended initial dose of 15 mg/kg/day, have experienced severe or life-threatening myelosuppression.



 Evaluate hematologic status prior to and during treatment with DROXIA. Provide supportive care and modify dose or discontinue DROXIA as needed. Recovery from myelosuppression is usually rapid when therapy is interrupted.



    5.2 Malignancies



  Hydroxyurea is a human carcinogen. In patients receiving long-term hydroxyurea for myeloproliferative disorders, secondary leukemia has been reported .  Skin cancer has also been reported in patients receiving long-term hydroxyurea. Advise protection from sun exposure and monitor for the development of secondary malignancies.



    5.3 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



   Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, DROXIA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Hydroxyurea was embryotoxic and teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses 0.8 times and 0.3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily dose on a mg/m  2  basis. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus [see  Use in Specific Populations  (  8.1  )].  Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and after treatment with DROXIA for at least 6 months after therapy. Advise males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and after treatment with DROXIA for at least 1 year after therapy [see  Use in Specific Populations  (  8.1  ,  8.3  )].
 

    5.4 Vasculitic Toxicities



  Cutaneous vasculitic toxicities, including vasculitic ulcerations and gangrene, have occurred in patients with myeloproliferative disorders during therapy with hydroxyurea. These vasculitic toxicities were reported most often in patients with a history of, or currently receiving, interferon therapy. If cutaneous vasculitic ulcers occur, institute treatment and discontinue DROXIA.



    5.5 Live Vaccinations



  Avoid use of live vaccine in patients taking DROXIA. Concomitant use of DROXIA with a live virus vaccine may potentiate the replication of the virus and/or may increase the adverse reaction of the vaccine because normal defense mechanisms may be suppressed by DROXIA. Vaccination with live vaccines in a patient receiving DROXIA may result in severe infection. Patient's antibody response to vaccines may be decreased. Consider consultation with a specialist.



    5.6 Risks with Concomitant Use of Antiretroviral Drugs



  Pancreatitis, hepatotoxicity, and peripheral neuropathy have occurred when hydroxyurea was administered concomitantly with antiretroviral drugs, including didanosine and stavudine [see  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ]  .



    5.7 Macrocytosis



  DROXIA may cause macrocytosis, which is self-limiting, and is often seen early in the course of treatment. The morphologic change resembles pernicious anemia, but is not related to vitamin B12or folic acid deficiency. This may mask the diagnosis of pernicious anemia. Prophylactic administration of folic acid is recommended.



    5.8 Laboratory Test Interference



  Interference with Uric Acid, Urea, or Lactic Acid Assays is possible, rendering falsely elevated results of these in patients treated with hydroxyurea [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].
