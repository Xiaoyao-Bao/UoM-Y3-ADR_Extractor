  6.1 Clinical Studies Experience

    Adult Patients  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The following listing shows adverse reactions based upon clinical trials with Optiray (ioversol) in 4,187 patients. Adverse reactions are listed by organ system according to clinical importance. More severe reactions are listed before others in a system regardless of incidence. The most common reaction is nausea, occurring at a rate of 1 percent.

Adverse reactions reported were similar in quality and frequency to the adverse events reported by adults.



 



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following additional adverse drug reactions have been reported during post-approval use of Optiray. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate frequency.



   Cardiac disorders:  coronary artery spasm, cyanosis, arrhythmia (ventricular fibrillation, tachycardia, extrasystole), ECG abnormal.



   Endocrine disorders:  thyroid function tests indicative of hypothyroidism or transient thyroid suppression have been uncommonly reported following iodinated contrast media administration to adult and pediatric patients, including infants, some patients were treated for hypothyroidism.



   Eye disorders:  temporary blindness, conjunctivitis (including eye irritation, ocular hyperemia, watery eyes).



   Gastrointestinal disorders:  tongue edema, salivary hypersecretion.

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



     EXCERPT:    *  Hypersensitivity Reactions: life-threatening or fatal reactions can occur. Always have emergency equipment and trained personnel available. (  5.2  ) 
 *  Contrast Induced Acute Kidney Injury: Acute injury, including renal failure, can occur. Minimize dose and maintain adequate hydration to minimize risk. (  5.3  ) 
 *  Cardiovascular Reactions: hemodynamic disturbances including shock and cardiac arrest may occur during or after administration. (  5.4  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Risks Associated with Inadvertent Intrathecal Administration



  Optiray is indicated for intravascular use only [see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  )]  . Inadvertent intrathecal administration can cause death, convulsions, cerebral hemorrhage, coma, paralysis, arachnoiditis, acute renal failure, cardiac arrest, seizures, rhabdomyolysis, hyperthermia, and brain edema.



    5.2 Hypersensitivity Reactions



  Optiray can cause life-threatening or fatal hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock. Manifestations include respiratory arrest, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, angioedema, and shock. Most severe reactions develop shortly after the start of the injection (e.g. within 1 to 3 minutes), but delayed reactions may occur. There is an increased risk in patients with a history of a previous reaction to contrast agent, and known allergies (i.e., bronchial asthma, drug, or food allergies), and other hypersensitivities. Premedication with antihistamines or corticosteroids to avoid or minimize possible allergic reactions does not prevent serious life-threatening reactions, but may reduce both their incidence and severity.



 Obtain a history of allergy, hypersensitivity, or prior hypersensitivity reactions to iodinated contrast agents. Always have emergency resuscitation equipment and trained personnel available and monitor all patients for hypersensitivity reactions.



    



    5.3 Contrast Induced Acute Kidney Injury



  Acute kidney injury, including renal failure, may occur after Optiray administration. Risk factors include: pre-existing renal impairment, dehydration, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, advanced vascular disease, elderly age, concomitant use of nephrotoxic or diuretic medications, multiple myeloma / paraproteinaceous diseases, repetitive and/or large doses of an iodinated contrast agent.



 Use the lowest necessary dose of Optiray in patients with renal impairment. Adequately hydrate patients prior to and following Optiray administration. Do not use laxatives, diuretics, or preparatory dehydration prior to Optiray administration.



 



    5.4 Cardiovascular Adverse Reactions



  Optiray increases the circulatory osmotic load and may induce acute or delayed hemodynamic disturbances in patients with congestive heart failure, severely impaired renal function, combined renal and hepatic disease, combined renal and cardiac disease, particularly when repetitive or large doses are administered.



 Life-threatening or fatal cardiovascular reactions have occurred with the use of Optiray, including cardiac arrest, hypotensive collapse, and shock. Most deaths occur within 10 minutes of injection; with cardiovascular disease as the main underlying factor. Cardiac decompensation, serious arrhythmias, and myocardial ischemia or infarction can occur during coronary arteriography and ventriculography.



 Based upon literature reports, deaths from the administration of iodinated contrast agents range from 6.6 per 1 million (0.00066 percent) to 1 in 10,000 patients (0.01 percent). Use the lowest necessary dose of Optiray in patients with congestive heart failure and always have emergency resuscitation equipment and trained personnel available. Monitor all patients for severe cardiovascular reactions.



    5.5 Thromboembolic Events



    Angiocardiography    Serious, fatal, thromboembolic events causing myocardial infarction and stroke can occur during angiographic procedures with Optiray. During these procedures, increased thrombosis and activation of the complement system occurs. Risk factors for thromboembolic events include: length of procedure, catheter and syringe material, underlying disease state, and concomitant medications.
 

 To minimize thromboembolic events use meticulous angiographic technique. Avoid blood remaining in contact with syringes containing Optiray, which increases the risk of clotting. Avoid angiocardiography in patients with homocystinuria because of the risk of inducing thrombosis and embolism [see Clinical Pharmacology (  12.2  )]  .



    5.6 Extravasation and Injection Site Reactions



  Extravasation can occur with Optiray administration, particularly in patients with severe arterial or venous disease and can be associated with pain, hemorrhage and necrosis. Ensure intravascular placement of catheters prior to injection. Monitor patients for extravasation and advise patients to seek medical care for progression of symptoms.



    5.7 Thyroid Storm in Patients with Hyperthyroidism



  Optiray is contraindicated in patients with symptomatic hyperthyroidism [see Contraindications (  4  )]  . Thyroid storm has occurred following the intravascular use of iodinated radiopaque agents in patients with hyperthyroidism or with an autonomously functioning thyroid nodule. Evaluate the risk in such patients before use of Optiray.



    5.8 Hypertensive Crisis in Patients with Pheochromocytoma



  Hypertensive crisis has occurred after the use of iodinated radiopaque contrast agents in patient with pheochromocytoma. Closely monitor patients when administering Optiray if pheochromocytoma or catecholamine-secreting paraganglioma is suspected. Inject the minimum amount of Optiray necessary and have measures for treatment of hypertensive crisis readily available.



    5.9 Sickle Cell Crisis in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease



  Iodinated contrast agents may promote sickling in individuals who are homozygous for sickle cell disease. Hydrate patients prior to and following Optiray administration, use Optiray only if the necessary imaging information cannot be obtained with alternative imaging modalities, and inject the minimum amount necessary.



    5.10 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions



   Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) may develop from 1 hour to several weeks after intravascular contrast agent administration. These reactions include Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). Reaction severity may increase and time to onset may decrease with repeat administration of a contrast agent; prophylactic medications may not prevent or mitigate severe cutaneous adverse reactions. Avoid administering Optiray to patients with a history of a severe cutaneous adverse reaction to Optiray.
