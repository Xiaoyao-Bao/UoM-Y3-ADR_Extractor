    *  The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: 
 *    Somnolence [  see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  
 *    Falls or other accidents resulting from the effect of the combined use of BONJESTA with CNS depressants including alcohol [  see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  
      EXCERPT:   The most common adverse reaction (&gt;=5 percent and exceeding the rate in placebo) with combination 10 mg doxylamine succinate and 10 mg pyridoxine hydrochloride tablets is somnolence. (  6  )
 

   To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact    Duchesnay Inc. at 1-855-722-7734 or    medicalinfo@duchesnayusa.com    or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or    www.fda.gov/medwatch.  



 

  6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 The safety and efficacy of combination 10 mg doxylamine succinate and 10 mg pyridoxine hydrochloride tablets compared to placebo was studied in a double-blind, randomized, multi-center trial in 261 women with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. The mean gestational age at enrollment was 9.3 weeks, range 7 to 14 weeks gestation  [  see Clinical Studies (14)  ]  . Adverse reactions that occurred at an incidence &gt;=5 percent and exceeded the incidence for placebo are summarized in Table 1.



   Table 1: Number (Percent) of Women with &gt;= 5 Percent Adverse Reactions in a 15-Day Placebo-Controlled Trial of Combination 10 mg Doxylamine Succinate and 10 mg Pyridoxine Hydrochloride Tablets (Only Those Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence &gt;= 5 Percent and at a Higher Incidence than Placebo are Shown)  




  Adverse Reaction      Combination 10 mg Doxylamine Succinate and 10 mg Pyridoxine Hydrochloride Tablets  (N = 133)    Placebo  (n = 128)    
  Somnolence            19 (14.3%)    15 (11.7%)    
      
 

   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse events, listed alphabetically, have been identified during post-approval use of the combination of 10 mg doxylamine succinate and 10 mg pyridoxine hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure  .  



   Cardiac disorders  : dyspnea, palpitation, tachycardia



   Ear and labyrinth disorders  : vertigo



   Eye disorders  : vision blurred, visual disturbances



   Gastrointestinal disorders  : abdominal distension, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea



   General disorders and administration site conditions  : chest discomfort, fatigue, irritability, malaise



   Immune system disorders  : hypersensitivity



   Nervous system disorders  : dizziness, headache, migraines, paresthesia, psychomotor hyperactivity



   Psychiatric disorders  : anxiety, disorientation, insomnia, nightmares



   Renal and urinary disorders  : dysuria, urinary retention



   Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders  : hyperhidrosis, pruritus, rash, rash maculopapular

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Somnolence: BONJESTA may cause somnolence. Avoid engaging in activities requiring complete mental alertness, such as driving or operating heavy machinery, while using BONJESTA until cleared to do so by a healthcare provider (  5.1  ) 
 *  Central nervous system (CNS) depressants: Concurrent use with alcohol or other CNS depressants is not recommended (  5.1  ) 
 *  Anticholinergic actions: Use with caution in patients with asthma, increased intraocular pressure, narrow angle glaucoma, stenosing peptic ulcer, pyloroduodenal obstruction and urinary bladder-neck obstruction (  5.2  ) 
 *  Interference with urine drug screen: BONJESTA may interfere with urine screening for methadone, opiates and PCP (  5.3  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Somnolence and Severe Drowsiness



  BONJESTA may cause somnolence due to the anticholinergic properties of doxylamine succinate, an antihistamine. Women should avoid engaging in activities requiring complete mental alertness, such as driving or operating heavy machinery, while using BONJESTA until cleared to do so by their healthcare provider.



 BONJESTA use is not recommended if a woman is concurrently using central nervous system (CNS) depressants including alcohol. The combination may result in severe drowsiness leading to falls or accidents [  see Drug Interactions (7.1)  ]  .



    5.2 Concomitant Medical Conditions



  BONJESTA has anticholinergic properties and, therefore, should be used with caution in women with: asthma, increased intraocular pressure, narrow angle glaucoma, stenosing peptic ulcer, pyloroduodenal obstruction or urinary bladder-neck obstruction.



    5.3 Interference with Urine Screen for Methadone, Opiates and Phencyclidine Phosphate (PCP)



  There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for methadone, opiates, and PCP with doxylamine succinate/pyridoxine hydrochloride use   [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].
