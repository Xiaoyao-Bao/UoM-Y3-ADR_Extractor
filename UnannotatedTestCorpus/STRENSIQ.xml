  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The data described below reflect exposure to STRENSIQ in 99 patients with perinatal/infantile- or juvenile-onset HPP (age 1 day to 58 years) treated with STRENSIQ, most for more than 2 years (range 1 day to 312 weeks [78 months]): 51 patients received at least 96 weeks (24 months) of treatment and 39 patients received 168 weeks (42 months) or more of treatment.



     Common Adverse Reactions  



 Overall, the most common adverse reactions reported were injection site reactions (63%)  .  Other common adverse reactions included lipodystrophy (28%), ectopic calcifications (14%), and hypersensitivity reactions (12%).



 Table 4 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 10% in clinical trials following subcutaneous injection of STRENSIQ, by patient population and STRENSIQ dosage regimen.



 The frequency of injection site reactions, lipodystrophy and ectopic calcification were higher in patients with juvenile-onset HPP as compared to perinatal/infantile-onset HPP patients.



 The majority of injection site reactions resolved within a week. Two patients experienced injection site reactions that led to reductions of their STRENSIQ dose. One patient switched from six times per week dosing to 3 times per week dosing as a result of injection site reactions. One other patient experienced a severe injection site reaction of injection site discoloration and withdrew from the trial.

 Adverse reactions that occurred at rates less than 1% included:



 *  Hypocalcemia 
 *  Renal stones 
 *  Chronic hepatitis 
 *  Decreased vitamin B6 
      6.2 Immunogenicity
   As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. During clinical trials, anti-drug antibodies have been detected in patients receiving treatment with STRENSIQ using an electrochemiluminescent (ECL) immunoassay. Antibody positive samples were tested to determine the presence of neutralizing antibodies based on in vitro inhibition of the catalytic activity of STRENSIQ. Among 98 patients with hypophosphatasia (HPP) enrolled in the clinical trials and who had post-baseline antibody data, 76 (78%) tested positive for anti-drug antibodies at some time point after receiving STRENSIQ treatment. Among those 76 patients, 34 (45%) also showed the presence of neutralizing antibodies. No correlation was observed between the anti-drug antibody titer and neutralizing antibody (% inhibition) values. Formation of anti-drug antibody resulted in a reduced systemic exposure of asfotase alfa.  [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  .



 The detection of antibody formation is dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of the antibodies to STRENSIQ with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *   Hypersensitivity Reactions: Monitor and if a severe reaction occurs, discontinue treatment and initiate appropriate medical treatment. (  5.1  ) 
 *   Lipodystrophy: Localized reactions were reported after several months of treatment; follow proper injection technique and rotate injection sites. (  5.2  ) 
 *   Ectopic Calcifications (eye and kidneys): Monitor using ophthalmologic examinations and renal ultrasounds at baseline and periodically during treatment. (  5.3  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions



  Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported in STRENSIQ-treated patients. Signs and symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis included difficulty breathing, choking sensation, nausea, periorbital edema, and dizziness. These reactions have occurred within minutes after subcutaneous administration of STRENSIQ and can occur in patients on treatment for more than one year. Other hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported in STRENSIQ-treated patients, including vomiting, fever, headache, flushing, irritability, chills, skin erythema, rash, pruritus and oral hypoesthesia [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



 If a severe hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue STRENSIQ treatment and initiate appropriate medical treatment. Consider the risks and benefits of re-administering STRENSIQ to individual patients following a severe reaction. If the decision is made to re-administer the product, monitor patients for a reoccurrence of signs and symptoms of a severe hypersensitivity reaction.



    5.2 Lipodystrophy



  Localized lipodystrophy, including lipoatrophy and lipohypertrophy, has been reported at injection sites after several months in patients treated with STRENSIQ in clinical trials [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Advise patients to follow proper injection technique and to rotate injection sites [see  Dosage and Administration (2.4)  ]  .



    5.3 Ectopic Calcifications



  Patients with HPP are at increased risk for developing ectopic calcifications. In clinical trials with STRENSIQ, 14 cases (14%) of ectopic calcification of the eye including the cornea and conjunctiva, and the kidneys (nephrocalcinosis) were reported. There was insufficient information to determine whether or not the reported events were consistent with the disease or due to STRENSIQ. No visual changes or changes in renal function were reported resulting from the occurrence of ectopic calcifications.



 Ophthalmology examinations and renal ultrasounds are recommended at baseline and periodically during treatment with STRENSIQ to monitor for signs and symptoms of ophthalmic and renal ectopic calcifications and for changes in vision or renal function.
