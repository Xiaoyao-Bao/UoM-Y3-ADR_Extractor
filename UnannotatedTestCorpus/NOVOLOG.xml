  6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

    *     Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying designs, the adverse reaction rates reported in one clinical trial may not be easily compared to those rates reported in another clinical trial, and may not reflect the rates actually observed in clinical practice. The safety of NOVOLOG was evaluated in two treat-to-target trials of 6 months duration, conducted in subjects with type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes [see    Clinical Studies (14)  ].  
 *     The data in Table 1 reflect the exposure of 596 patients with type 1 diabetes to NOVOLOG in one clincal trial with a mean exposure duration to NOVOLOG of 24 weeks. The mean age was 38.9 years. Fifty-one percent were male, 94% were Caucasian, 2% were Black and 4% were other races. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 25.6 kg/m  2  . The mean duration of diabetes was 15.7 years and the mean HbA1cat baseline was 7.9%. 
 *     The data in Table 2 reflect the exposure of 91 patients with type 2 diabetes to NOVOLOG in one clincal trial with a mean exposure duration to NOVOLOG of 24 weeks. The mean age was 56.6 years. Sixty-three percent were male, 76% were Caucasian, 9% were Black and 15% were other races. The mean BMI was 29.7 kg/m  2  . The mean duration of diabetes was 12.7 years and the mean HbA1cat baseline was 8.1%. 
    Common adverse reactions were defined as events occurring in &gt;=5%, excluding hypoglycemia, of the population studied. Common adverse events occurring at the same rate or greater for NOVOLOG-treated subjects than on comparator-treated subjects during clinical trials in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus (other than hypoglycemia) are listed in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively.

   Severe hypoglycemia  



 Hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients using insulin, including NOVOLOG  [see  Warnings and Precautions  (  5.3  )].  The rates of reported hypoglycemia depend on the definition of hypoglycemia used, diabetes type, insulin dose, intensity of glucose control, background therapies, and other intrinsic and extrinsic patient factors. For these reasons, comparing rates of hypoglycemia in clinical trials for NOVOLOG with the incidence of hypoglycemia for other products may be misleading and also, may not be representative of hypoglycemia rates that will occur in clinical practice.



 Severe    hypoglycemia was defined as hypoglycemia associated with central nervous system symptoms and requiring the intervention of another person or hospitalization.



 The incidence of severe hypoglycemia in adult and pediatric patients receiving subcutaneous NOVOLOG with type 1 diabetes mellitus was 17% at 24 weeks and 6% at 24 weeks, respectively  [see      Clinical Studies (14)  ]  .



 The incidence of severe hypoglycemia in adult patients receiving subcutaneous NOVOLOG with type 2 diabetes mellitus was 10% at 24 weeks.



 The incidence of severe hypoglycemia in adult and pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, receiving NOVOLOG via continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion by external pump was 2% at 16 weeks and 10% at 16 weeks respectively.



 No severe hypoglycemic episodes were reported in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving NOVOLOG via continuous subcutanuous insulin infusion by external pump at 16 weeks.



   Allergic Reactions  



 Some patients taking insulin therapy, including NOVOLOG have experienced erythema, local edema, and pruritus at the site of injection. These conditions were usually self-limiting. Severe cases of generalized allergy (anaphylaxis) have been reported  [see      Warning and Precautions  (  5.5  )].  



   Insulin initiation and glucose control intensification  



 Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder, worsening of diabetic retinopathy, and acute painful peripheral neuropathy. However, long-term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy.



   Lipodystrophy  



 Administration of insulin, including NOVOLOG, subcutaneously and via subcutaneous insulin infusion by external pump, has resulted in lipoatrophy (depression in the skin) or lipohypertrophy (enlargement or thickening of tissue) in some patients  [see      Dosage and Administration  (  2.2  )].  



   Peripheral Edema  



 Insulin products, including NOVOLOG, may cause sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy.



   Weight gain  



 Weight gain has occurred with some insulin therapies including NOVOLOG and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria.



   6.2 Immunogenicity

  As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to NOVOLOG in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading.



 In a 6-month study with a 6 month extension in adult subjects with type 1 diabetes, 99.8% of patients who received NOVOLOG were positive for anti-insulin antibodies (AIA) at least once during the study, including 97.2% that were positive at baseline. A total of 92.1% of patients who received NOVOLOG were positive for anti-drug antibodies (ADA) at least once during the study, including 64.6% that were positive at baseline.



 In a phase 3 type 1 diabetes clinical trial of NOVOLOG, initial increase in titers of antibodies to insulin, followed by a decrease to baseline values, was observed in regular human insulin and insulin aspart treatment groups with similar incidences. These antibodies did not cause deterioration in glycemic control or necessitate increases in insulin dose.



   6.3 Post Marketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of NOVOLOG. Because these adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 Medication errors have been reported in which other insulins have been accidentally substituted for NOVOLOG  [see  Warnings and Precautions  (  5.4  )]  .

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *     Never share a NOVOLOG FlexPen or a NOVOLOG Flex Touch, PenFill cartridge or PenFill cartridge device between patients, even if the needle is changed (  5.1  ). 
 *     Hyper- or hypoglycemia with changes in insulin regimen: Carry out under close medical supervision and increase frequency of blood glucose monitoring (  5.2  ). 
 *     Hypoglycemia: May be life-threatening. Increase frequency of glucose monitoring with changes to: insulin dosage, co-administered glucose lowering medications, meal pattern, physical activity; and in patients with renal or hepatic impairments and hypoglycemia unawareness (  5.  3). 
 *     Medication Errors: Accidental mix-ups between insulin products can occur. Instruct patients to check insulin labels before injection (  5.  4). 
 *     Hypersensitivity reactions: Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, may occur. Discontinue NOVOLOG, treat, and monitor, if indicated (  5.  6). 
 *     Hypokalemia: May be life-threatening. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk of hypokalemia and treat if indicated (  5.  6). 
 *     Fluid  retention and heart failure with concomitant use of thiazolidinediones (TZDs): Observe for signs and symptoms of heart failure; consider dosage reduction or discontinuation if heart failure occurs (  5.7  ). 
 *     Hyperglycemia and Ketoacidosis Due to Insulin Pump Device Malfunction: Monitor glucose and administer NOVOLOG by subcutaneous injection if pump malfunction occurs (  5.8  ). 
    
 

   5.1 Never Share NOVOLOG FlexPen, NOVOLOG FlexTouch, PenFill Cartridge or PenFill Cartridge Device Between Patients



  NOVOLOG FlexPen, NOVOLOG FlexTouch, PenFill cartridge, and PenFill cartridge devices should never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Patients using NOVOLOG vials must never share needles or syringes with another person. Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens.



    5.2 Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen



  Changes in insulin strength, manufacturer, type, or method of administration may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]  or hyperglycemia. These changes should be made cautiously and only under close medical supervision, and the frequency of blood glucose monitoring should be increased. For patients with type 2 diabetes, dosage adjustments of concomitant anti-diabetic products may be needed.



    5.3 Hypoglycemia



  Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse effect of all insulin therapies, including NOVOLOG. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may lead to unconsciousness may be life threatening or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place an individual and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g. driving or operating other machinery).



 Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over time in the same individual. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes in patients with diabetic nerve disease, in patients using medications that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers) [see  Drug Interactions (7)  ]  , or in patients who experience recurrent hypoglycemia.



   Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia    



 The risk of hypoglycemia after an injection is related to the duration of action of the insulin and, in general, is highest when the glucose lowering effect of the insulin is maximal. As with all insulin preparations, the glucose lowering effect time course of NOVOLOG may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and depends on may conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature [see  Clinical Pharmacology  (  12.2  )]  . Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to co-administered medication [ see  Drug Interactions (7)    ].   Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia [see  Use in Specific Populations  (  8.6  ,  8.7  )].  



   Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia    



 Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended.



    5.4 Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors



  Accidental mix-ups between NOVOLOG and other insulin products have been reported. To avoid medication errors between NOVOLOG and other insulins, instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection.



    5.5 Hypersensitivity and Allergic Reactions



  Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulin products, including NOVOLOG. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue NOVOLOG; treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve [see  Adverse Reactions (6)  ].  NOVOLOG is contraindicated in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to insulin aspart or one of the excipients [see  Contraindications (4)  ].  



    5.6 Hypokalemia



  All insulin products, including NOVOLOG, can cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia if indicated (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentration).



    5.7 Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of PPAR-gamma Agonists



  Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including NOVOLOG, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered.



    5.8 Hyperglycemia and Ketoacidosis Due to Insulin Pump Device Malfunction



  Malfunction of the insulin pump or insulin infusion set or insulin degradation can rapidly lead to hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis. Prompt identification and correction of the cause of hyperglycemia or ketosis is necessary. Interim subcutaneous injections with NOVOLOG may be required. Patients using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump therapy must be trained to administer insulin by injection and have alternate insulin therapy available in case of pump failure [see  How Supplied/Storage and Handling  (  16.2  ) and  Patient Counseling Information  (  17  )]  .
