    <Section id="S1" name="adverse reactions">   ADVERSE REACTIONS1. Although the relationship, if any, of retinal detachment to the administration of echothiophateiodide for ophthalmic solution has not been established, retinal detachment has been reported ina few cases during the use of echothiophate iodide for ophthalmic solution in adult patientswithout a previous history of this disorder.2. Stinging, burning, lacrimation, lid muscle twitching, conjunctival and ciliary redness,browache, induced myopia with visual blurring may occur.43. Activation of latent iritis or uveitis may occur.4. Iris cysts may form, and if treatment is continued, may enlarge and obscure vision. Thisoccurrence is more frequent in children. The cysts usually shrink upon discontinuance of themedication, reduction in strength of the drops or frequency of instillation. Rarely, they mayrupture or break free into the aqueous. Regular examinations are advisable when the drug isbeing prescribed for the treatment of accommodative esotropia.5. Prolonged use may cause conjunctival thickening, obstruction of nasolacrimal canals.6. Lens opacities occurring in patients under treatment for glaucoma with echothiophate iodidefor ophthalmic solution have been reported and similar changes have been producedexperimentally in normal monkeys. Routine examinations should accompany clinical use of thedrug.7. Paradoxical increase in intraocular pressure may follow anticholinesterase instillation. Thismay be alleviated by prescribing a sympathomimetic mydriatic such as phenylephrine.8. Cardiac irregularities.

  1. Succinylcholine should be administered only with great caution, if at all, prior to or during  general anesthesia to patients receiving anticholinesterase medication because of possiblerespiratory or cardiovascular collapse.
 

  2. Caution should be observed in treating glaucoma with echothiophate iodide for ophthalmic  solution in patients who are at the same time undergoing treatment with systemicanticholinesterase medications for myasthenia gravis, because of possible adverse additiveeffects.

  General  1. Gonioscopy is recommended prior to initiation of therapy. Routine examination to detect lensopacity should accompany clinical use of echothiophate iodide for ophthalmic solution.
 

  2. Where there is a quiescent uveitis or a history of this condition, anticholinesterase therapy  should be avoided or used cautiously because of the intense and persistent miosis and ciliarymuscle contraction that may occur.
 

  3. While systemic effects are infrequent, proper use of the drug requires digital compression of  the nasolacrimal ducts for a minute or two following instillation to minimize drainage into thenasal chamber with its extensive absorption area. To prevent possible skin absorption, handsshould be washed following instillation.
 

  4. Temporary or permanent discontinuance of medication is necessary if cardiac irregularities  occur.
 

  5. Anticholinesterase drugs should be used with extreme caution, if at all, in patients with  marked vagotonia, bronchial asthma, spastic gastrointestinal disturbances, peptic ulcer,pronounced bradycardia and hypotension, recent myocardial infarction, epilepsy, parkinsonism,and other disorders that may respond adversely to vagotonic effects.
 

  6. Anticholinesterase drugs should be employed prior to ophthalmic surgery only as a considered  risk because of the possible occurrence of hyphema.
 

  7. Echothiophate iodide for ophthalmic solution should be used with great caution, if at all,  where there is a prior history of retinal detachment.8. Temporary discontinuance of medication is necessary if salivation, urinary incontinence,diarrhea, profuse sweating, muscle weakness, or respiratory difficulties occur.
 

  9. Patients receiving echothiophate iodide for ophthalmic solution who are exposed to  carbamate- or organophosphate-type insecticides and pesticides (professional gardeners, farmers,workers in plants manufacturing or formulating such products, etc.) should be warned of theadditive systemic effects possible from absorption of the pesticide through the respiratory tract orskin. During periods of exposure to such pesticides, the wearing of respiratory masks, andfrequent washing and clothing changes may be advisable.
