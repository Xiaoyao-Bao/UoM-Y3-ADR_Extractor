  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 Assessment of adverse reactions was based on exposure of 45 adult patients (31 female and 14 male) with UCD subtype deficiencies of ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC, n=40), carbamyl phosphate synthetase (CPS, n=2), and argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS, n=1) in a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled (RAVICTI vs sodium phenylbutyrate), crossover, 4-week study (Study 1) that enrolled patients 18 years of age and older  [see  Clinical Studies (14.1)  ]  . One of the 45 patients received only sodium phenylbutyrate prior to withdrawing on day 1 of the study due to an adverse reaction.



 The most common adverse reactions (occurring in at least 10% of patients) reported during short-term treatment with RAVICTI were diarrhea, flatulence, and headache. Table 1 summarizes adverse reactions occurring in 2 or more patients treated with RAVICTI or sodium phenylbutyrate (incidence of at least 4% in either treatment arm).

           Other Adverse Reactions  
 

 RAVICTI has been evaluated in 77 patients with UCDs (51 adult and 26 pediatric patients ages 2 years to 17 years) in 2 open-label long-term studies, in which 69 patients completed 12 months of treatment with RAVICTI (median exposure = 51 weeks). During these studies there were no deaths.



 Adverse reactions occurring in at least 10% of adult patients were nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, decreased appetite, dizziness, headache, and fatigue.



 Adverse reactions occurring in at least 10% of pediatric patients ages 2 years to 17 years were upper abdominal pain, rash, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, decreased appetite, and headache.



 RAVICTI has also been evaluated in 17 patients with UCDs ages 2 months to less than 2 years in 3 open-label studies. The median exposure was 6 months (range 0.2 to 18 months). Adverse reactions occurring in at least 10% of pediatric patients aged 2 months to less than 2 years were neutropenia, vomiting, diarrhea, pyrexia, hypophagia, cough, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, rash and papule.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of RAVICTI. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure:



 *  Abnormal body odor, including from skin, hair and urine 
 *  Retching and gagging 
 *  Dysgeusia or burning sensation in mouth

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *   Neurotoxicity : Phenylacetate (PAA), the active moiety of RAVICTI, may be toxic; reduce dosage for symptoms of neurotoxicity.  (5.1)   
 *   Reduced Phenylbutyrate Absorption in Pancreatic Insufficiency or Intestinal Malabsorption : Monitor ammonia levels closely.  (5.2)   
    
 

   5.1 Neurotoxicity



  The major metabolite of RAVICTI, PAA, is associated with neurotoxicity. Signs and symptoms of PAA neurotoxicity, including somnolence, fatigue, lightheadedness, headache, dysgeusia, hypoacusis, disorientation, impaired memory, and exacerbation of preexisting neuropathy, were observed at plasma PAA concentrations of 500 micrograms/mL in a study of adult cancer patients who were administered PAA intravenously. In this study, adverse reactions were reversible.



 In healthy subjects, after administration of 4 mL and 6 mL RAVICTI 3 times daily for 3 days, a dose-dependent increase in all-grade nervous system adverse reactions was observed, even at exposure levels of PAA less than 100 micrograms/mL.



 In clinical trials in patients with UCDs who had been on sodium phenylbutyrate prior to administration of RAVICTI, peak PAA concentrations after dosing with RAVICTI ranged from 1.6 to 178 micrograms/mL (mean: 39 micrograms/mL) in adult patients, from 1 to 410 micrograms/mL (mean: 70 micrograms/mL; median: 50 micrograms/mL) in pediatric patients ages 2 years and older, and from 1 to 1215 micrograms/mL (mean: 142 micrograms/mL; median: 35 micrograms/mL) in pediatric patients ages 2 months to less than 2 years. Some patients with UCDs experienced headache, fatigue, symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, seizures, tremor and/or dizziness. No correlation between PAA levels and neurotoxicity symptoms was identified but PAA levels were generally not measured at the time of neurotoxicity symptoms.



 If symptoms of vomiting, nausea, headache, somnolence or confusion, are present in the absence of high ammonia or other intercurrent illnesses, reduce the RAVICTI dosage [see  Dosage and Administration (2.4)  ]  .



    5.2 Reduced Phenylbutyrate Absorption in Pancreatic Insufficiency or Intestinal Malabsorption



  Exocrine pancreatic enzymes hydrolyze RAVICTI in the small intestine, separating the active moiety, phenylbutyrate, from glycerol. This process allows phenylbutyrate to be absorbed into the circulation. Low or absent pancreatic enzymes or intestinal disease resulting in fat malabsorption may result in reduced or absent digestion of RAVICTI and/or absorption of phenylbutyrate and reduced control of plasma ammonia. Monitor ammonia levels closely in patients with pancreatic insufficiency or intestinal malabsorption.
