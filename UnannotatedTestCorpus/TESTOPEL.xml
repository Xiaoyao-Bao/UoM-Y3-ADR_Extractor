  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of testosterone replacement therapy, including TESTOPEL  (r)  . Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 Implantation Site Infection and Pellet Extrusion: (see WARNINGS)  



 Endocrine and Urogenital, Male. Gynecomastia and excessive frequency and duration of penile erections. Oligospermia may occur at high dosages (see  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  ).



 Skin and Appendages. Hirsutism, male pattern of baldness, and acne.



 Cardiovascular Disorders. Myocardial infarction, stroke.



 Fluid and Electrolyte Disturbances. Retention of sodium, chloride, water, potassium, calcium and inorganic phosphates.



 Gastrointestinal. Nausea, cholestatic jaundice, alterations in liver function tests, rarely hepatocellular neoplasms and peliosis hepatis (see  WARNINGS  ).



 Hematologic. Suppression of clotting factors II, V, VII, and X, bleeding in patients on concomitant anticoagulant therapy, and polycythemia.



 Nervous System. Increased or decreased libido, headache, anxiety, depression, and generalized paresthesia.



 Metabolic. Increased serum cholesterol.



 Vascular Disorders: Venous thromboembolism (see  WARNINGS  )



 Miscellaneous. Rarely anaphylactoid reactions.

   GENERAL  



 Pellet implantation is much less flexible for dosage adjustment than is oral administration of or intramuscular injections of oil solutions or aqueous suspensions. Therefore, great care should be used when estimating the amount of testosterone needed.



 In the face of complications where the effects of testosterone should be discontinued, the pellets would have to be removed.



  INFORMATION FOR THE PATIENT  



 The physician should instruct patients to report any of the following side effects of androgens:



 Adult or adolescent males: Too frequent or persistent erections of the penis. Any nausea, vomiting, changes in skin color, ankle swelling.



 Implantation site infection and/or pellet extrusion can occur and may be associated with implant site induration, inflammation, fibrosis, bleeding, bruising, wound drainage, pain, itching, and pellet extrusion. (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS).



 Any male adolescent patient receiving androgens for delayed puberty should have bone development checked every 6 months.



  LABORATORY TESTS  



 *  Because of the hepatotoxicity associated with the use of 17-alpha-alkylated androgens, liver function tests should be obtained periodically. 
 *  Periodic (every 6 months) x-ray examinations of the bone age should be made during treatment of prepubertal males to determine the rate of bone maturation and the effects of androgen therapy on the epiphyseal centers. 
 *  Hemoglobin and hematocrit should be checked periodically for polycythemia in patients who are receiving high doses of androgens. 
     DRUG INTERACTIONS  
 

 *  Anticoagulants. C-17 substituted derivatives of testosterone, such as methandrostenolone have been reported to decrease the anticoagulant requirements of patients receiving oral anticoagulants. Patients receiving oral anticoagulant therapy require close monitoring, especially when androgens are started or stopped. 
 *  Oxyphenbutazone. Concurrent administration of oxyphenbutazone and androgens may result in elevated serum levels of oxyphenbutazone. 
 *  Insulin. In diabetic patients the metabolic effects of androgens may decrease blood glucose and insulin requirements. 
     DRUG/LABORATORY TEST INTERFERENCES  
 

 Androgens may decrease levels of thyroxine-binding globulin, resulting in decreased total T4serum levels and increased resin uptake of T3and T4. Free thyroid hormone levels remain unchanged, however, and there is no clinical evidence of thyroid dysfunction.



  CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY  



 Animal Data. Testosterone has been tested by subcutaneous injection and implantation in mice and rats. The implant induced cervical-uterine tumors in mice, which metastasized in some cases. There is suggestive evidence that injection of testosterone into some strains of female mice increases their susceptibility to hepatoma. Testosterone is also known to increase the number of tumors and decrease the degree of differentiation of chemically induced carcinomas of liver in rats.



 Human Data. There are rare reports of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients receiving long-term therapy with androgens in high doses. Withdrawal of the drugs did not lead to regression of the tumors in all cases.



 Geriatric patients treated with androgens may be at an increased risk for the development of prostatic hypertrophy and prostatic carcinoma.



  PREGNANCY  



 Teratogenic Effects. Pregnancy Category X (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).



  NURSING MOTHERS  



 It is not known whether androgens are excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from androgens, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.



  PEDIATRIC USE  



 Androgen therapy should be used very cautiously in children and only by specialists who are aware of the adverse effects on bone maturation. Skeletal maturation must be monitored every 6 months by an x-ray of the hand and wrist (see  INDICATIONS AND USAGE  and  WARNINGS  ).

  In patients with breast cancer, androgen therapy may cause hypercalcemia by stimulating osteolysis. In this case, the drug should be discontinued.



 Prolonged use of high doses of androgens has been associated with the development of peliosis hepatis and hepatic neoplasms including hepatocellular carcinoma (see  PRECAUTIONS  - Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility). Peliosis hepatis can be a life-threatening or fatal complication.



 Men treated with androgens may be at an increased risk for the development of prostatic hypertrophy and prostatic carcinoma.



 There have been postmarketing reports of venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients using testosterone products, such as Testopel  (r)  (testosterone pellets). Evaluate patients who report symptoms of pain, edema, warmth and erythema in the lower extremity for DVT and those who present with acute shortness of breath for PE. If a venous thromboembolic event is suspected, discontinue treatment with Testopel  (r)  (testosterone pellets) and initiate appropriate workup and management [see  ADVERSE REACTIONS  .



 Long term clinical safety trials have not been conducted to assess the cardiovascular outcomes of testosterone replacement therapy in men. To date, epidemiologic studies and randomized controlled trials have been inconclusive for determining the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), such as non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and cardiovascular death, with the use of testosterone compared to non-use. Some studies, but not all, have reported an increased risk of MACE in association with use of testosterone replacement therapy in men. Patients should be informed of this possible risk when deciding whether to use or to continue to use Testopel(r) (testosterone pellets).



 Testosterone has been subject to abuse, typically at doses higher than recommended for the approved indication and in combination with other anabolic steroids. Anabolic androgenic steroid abuse can lead to serious cardiovascular and psychiatric adverse reactions (see  DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE  ) .  



 If testosterone abuse is suspected, check serum testosterone concentrations to ensure they are within therapeutic range. However, testosterone levels may be in the normal or subnormal range in men abusing synthetic testosterone derivatives. Counsel patients concerning the serious adverse reactions associated with abuse of testosterone and anabolic androgenic steroids. Conversely, consider the possibility of testosterone and anabolic androgenic steroid abuse in suspected patients who present with serious cardiovascular or psychiatric adverse events.



 Edema with or without congestive heart failure may be a serious complication in patients with preexisting cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease. In addition to discontinuation of the drug, diuretic therapy may be required.



 Gynecomastia frequently develops in patients and occasionally persists in patients being treated for hypogonadism.



 Androgen therapy should be used cautiously in healthy males with delayed puberty. The effect on bone maturation should be monitored by assessing bone age of the wrist and hand every 6 months. In children, androgen treatment may accelerate bone maturation without producing compensatory gain in linear growth. This adverse effect may result in compromised adult stature. The younger the child the greater the risk of compromising final mature height.



 Post-marketing cases associate TESTOPEL  (r)  pellet(s) insertion with implant site infection (cellulitis and abscess), and/or pellet extrusion at or near the implantation site. Infection and extrusion may occur concurrently or separately. Reported signs and symptoms of infection and/or extrusion at the implant site included induration, inflammation, fibrosis, bleeding, bruising, wound drainage, pain, itching, and pellet extrusion. Although cases of infection and/or extrusion may occur at any time, most reported cases occurred within the first month after TESTOPEL  (r)  implantation. Infection and/or extrusion may require further treatment (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).



 This drug has not been shown to be safe and effective for the enhancement of athletic performance. Because of the potential risk for serious adverse health effects, this drug should not be used for such purpose.
