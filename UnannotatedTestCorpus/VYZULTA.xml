  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 VYZULTA was evaluated in 811 patients in 2 controlled clinical trials of up to 12 months duration. The most common ocular adverse reactions observed in patients treated with latanoprostene bunod were: conjunctival hyperemia (6%), eye irritation (4%), eye pain (3%), and instillation site pain (2%). Approximately 0.6% of patients discontinued therapy due to ocular adverse reactions including ocular hyperemia, conjunctival irritation, eye irritation, eye pain, conjunctival edema, vision blurred, punctate keratitis and foreign body sensation.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *    Pigmentation: Increased pigmentation of the iris and periorbital tissue (eyelid) can occur. Iris pigmentation is likely to be permanent. (  5.1  ) 
 *    Eyelash changes: Gradual changes to eyelashes including increased length, increased thickness and number of eyelashes. Usually reversible upon discontinuation of treatment. (  5.2  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Pigmentation



  VYZULTATM (latanoprostene bunod ophthalmic solution), 0.024% may cause changes to pigmented tissues. The most frequently reported changes with prostaglandin analogs have been increased pigmentation of the iris and periorbital tissue (eyelid).



 Pigmentation is expected to increase as long as latanoprostene bunod ophthalmic solution is administered. The pigmentation change is due to increased melanin content in the melanocytes rather than to an increase in the number of melanocytes. After discontinuation of VYZULTA, pigmentation of the iris is likely to be permanent, while pigmentation of the periorbital tissue and eyelash changes are likely to be reversible in most patients. Patients who receive prostaglandin analogs, including VYZULTA, should be informed of the possibility of increased pigmentation, including permanent changes. The long-term effects of increased pigmentation are not known.



 Iris color change may not be noticeable for several months to years. Typically, the brown pigmentation around the pupil spreads concentrically towards the periphery of the iris and the entire iris or parts of the iris become more brownish. Neither nevi nor freckles of the iris appear to be affected by treatment. While treatment with VYZULTATM (latanoprostene bunod ophthalmic solution), 0.024% can be continued in patients who develop noticeably increased iris pigmentation, these patients should be examined regularly [see  Patient Counseling Information (17)  ].  



    5.2 Eyelash Changes



  VYZULTA may gradually change eyelashes and vellus hair in the treated eye. These changes include increased length, thickness, and the number of lashes or hairs. Eyelash changes are usually reversible upon discontinuation of treatment.



    5.3 Intraocular Inflammation



  VYZULTA should be used with caution in patients with a history of intraocular inflammation (iritis/uveitis) and should generally not be used in patients with active intraocular inflammation as it may exacerbate this condition.



    5.4 Macular Edema



  Macular edema, including cystoid macular edema, has been reported during treatment with prostaglandin analogs. VYZULTA should be used with caution in aphakic patients, in pseudophakic patients with a torn posterior lens capsule, or in patients with known risk factors for macular edema.



    5.5 Bacterial Keratitis



  There have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of multiple-dose containers of topical ophthalmic products. These containers had been inadvertently contaminated by patients who, in most cases, had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface.



    5.6 Use with Contact Lens



  Contact lenses should be removed prior to the administration of VYZULTA because this product contains benzalkonium chloride. Lenses may be reinserted 15 minutes after administration.
