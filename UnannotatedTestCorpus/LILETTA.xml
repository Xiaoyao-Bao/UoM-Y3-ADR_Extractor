    6.1         Clinical Trial Experience  

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The data described below reflect exposure of 1,751 generally healthy 16- to 45-year-old women to LILETTA in a large, multi-center contraceptive trial conducted in the US, including 1,409 exposed for 1 year and 837 subjects who completed 4 years of use; 58% were nulliparous (mean age 25.1 +/- 4.3 years) and 42% were parous (mean age 30.3 +/- 6.1 years).  Most women who received LILETTA were Caucasian (78.4%) or Black/African American (13.3%); 14.7% of women were of Hispanic ethnicity. The clinical trial had no upper or lower weight or BMI limit. Mean BMI of LILETTA subjects was 26.9 kg/m  2  (range 15.8 - 61.6 kg/m  2  ); 25.1% had a BMI &gt;= 30 kg/m  2  , of which 5.3% had a BMI &gt;= 40 kg/m  2  . The data cover more than 59,000 28-day cycles of LILETTA exposure. The frequencies of reported adverse drug reactions represent crude incidences.



 The most common adverse reactions during the LILETTA clinical trial (occurring in &gt;= 5% of users) are shown in Table 3.

 Vaginal discharge  5.3%              
 Back pain        5.2%              
        In the contraceptive trial, 18.3% of LILETTA users discontinued prematurely due to an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were expulsion (3.7%) and bleeding complaints (2.2%). The next most common adverse reactions causing discontinuation were acne (1.4%), dysmenorrhea (1.0%), weight increased (1.0%), mood swings (0.8%), uterine spasm (0.7%) and pelvic pain (0.6%).  One woman discontinued the clinical study due to PID and one due to endometritis.
 

 In the clinical trial, serious adverse reactions considered related or possibly related to LILETTA were ectopic pregnancies, ovarian cysts, and IUS perforation requiring a laparoscopic surgery.



     6.2         Postmarketing Experience  

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of LNG-releasing IUSs. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 *  Arterial thrombotic and venous thromboembolic events, including cases of pulmonary emboli, deep vein thrombosis and stroke 
 *  Device breakage 
 *  Hypersensitivity (including rash, urticaria, and angioedema) 
 *  Increased blood pressure

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">     5        WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  



   EXCERPT:    *  Remove LILETTA if pregnancy occurs with LILETTA in place and LILETTA is in the uterus. If pregnancy occurs, there is increased risk of ectopic pregnancy (including loss of fertility), pregnancy loss, septic abortion (including septicemia, shock and death) and premature labor and delivery. (  5.1  ,  5.2  ) 
 *  Group A streptococcal infection has been reported; strict aseptic technique is essential during insertion. (  5.3  ) 
 *  Before using LILETTA, consider the risks of PID. (  5.4  ) 
 *  Perforation may occur and reduce contraceptive effectiveness. Risk is increased if inserted in women with fixed retroverted uteri, during lactation, and postpartum. (  5.5  ) 
 *  Partial or complete expulsion may occur. (  5.6  ) 
 *  Evaluate persistent enlarged ovarian follicles or ovarian cysts. (  5.7  ) 
 *  Bleeding patterns become altered, may remain irregular and amenorrhea may ensue. (  5.8  ) 
    
 

    5.1        Ectopic Pregnancy  



  Evaluate women for ectopic pregnancy if they become pregnant with LILETTA in place because the likelihood of a pregnancy being ectopic is increased with LILETTA. Approximately half of pregnancies that occur with LILETTA in place are likely to be ectopic. Also consider the possibility of ectopic pregnancy in the case of lower abdominal pain, especially in association with missed periods or if an amenorrheic woman starts bleeding. If an ectopic pregnancy is confirmed, LILETTA should be removed.



 The incidence of ectopic pregnancy in the clinical trial with LILETTA, which excluded women with a history of ectopic pregnancy who did not have a subsequent intrauterine pregnancy, was approximately 0.16 per 100 women-years. The risk of ectopic pregnancy in women who have a history of ectopic pregnancy and use LILETTA is unknown. Women with a previous history of ectopic pregnancy, tubal surgery or pelvic infection have a higher risk of ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancy may require surgery and may result in loss of fertility.



 Tell women who choose LILETTA about the risks of ectopic pregnancy, including the loss of fertility. Teach them to recognize and report to their healthcare provider promptly any signs of ectopic pregnancy.



     5.2        Intrauterine Pregnancy  



  If pregnancy occurs while using LILETTA, determine if LILETTA is in the uterus. If LILETTA is in the uterus, attempt to remove LILETTA because leaving it in place may increase the risk of spontaneous abortion and preterm labor. Removal of LILETTA or probing of the uterus may also result in spontaneous abortion. In the event of an intrauterine pregnancy with LILETTA, consider the following:



  Septic abortion  



 In patients becoming pregnant with an IUS in place, septic abortion - with septicemia, septic shock, and death - may occur. Septic abortion typically requires hospitalization and treatment with intravenous antibiotics. Septic abortion may result in spontaneous abortion or a medical indication for pregnancy termination. Should severe infection of the uterus occur, hysterectomy may be required, which will result in permanent infertility.



  Continuation of pregnancy  



 If a woman becomes pregnant with LILETTA in place and if LILETTA cannot be removed or the woman chooses not to have it removed, warn her that failure to remove LILETTA increases the risk of miscarriage, sepsis, premature labor, and premature delivery. Prenatal care should include counseling about these risks and that she should report immediately any flu-like symptoms, fever, chills, cramping, pain, bleeding, vaginal discharge or leakage of fluid, or any other symptom that suggests complications of the pregnancy.    



     5.3        Sepsis  



  Severe infection or sepsis, including Group A streptococcal sepsis (GAS), have been reported following insertion of other LNG-releasing IUSs. In some cases, severe pain occurred within hours of insertion followed by sepsis within days. Because death from GAS is more likely if treatment is delayed, it is important to be aware of these rare but serious infections. Aseptic technique during insertion of LILETTA is essential in order to minimize serious infections such as GAS.



     5.4        Pelvic Inflammatory Disease or Endometritis  



  Insertion of LILETTA is contraindicated in the presence of known or suspected PID or endometritis or a history of PID unless there has been a subsequent intrauterine pregnancy [ see Contraindications   (     4     )  ]. IUSs have been associated with an increased risk of PID, most likely due to organisms being introduced into the uterus during insertion.  



 In the clinical trial with LILETTA, pelvic infection was diagnosed in 0.8% of women.  The infection was diagnosed as PID in 0.5% of women and as endometritis in 0.3% of women.  One woman diagnosed with PID developed the infection within a week of LILETTA insertion, while the remainder were diagnosed more than six months after insertion. The cases of endometritis had onset less than 40 days after LILETTA insertion except for one occurring at 43 months after insertion.



 Counsel women who receive LILETTA to notify a healthcare provider if they have complaints of lower abdominal or pelvic pain, odorous discharge, unexplained bleeding, fever, or genital lesions or sores. In such circumstances, perform a pelvic examination promptly to evaluate for possible pelvic infection. Remove LILETTA in cases of recurrent PID or endometritis, or if an acute pelvic infection is severe or does not respond to treatment.



  Women at increased risk for PID or endometritis  



 PID and endometritis are often associated with a sexually transmitted infection (STI), and LILETTA does not protect against STIs. The risk of PID or endometritis is greater for women who have multiple sexual partners, and also for women whose sexual partner(s) have multiple sexual partners. Women who have had PID or endometritis are at increased risk for a recurrence or re-infection. In particular, ascertain whether the woman is at increased risk of infection (for example, leukemia, acquired immune deficiency syndrome [AIDS], IV drug abuse).



  Asymptomatic PID or endometritis  



 PID or endometritis may be asymptomatic but still result in tubal damage and its sequelae.



  Treatment of PID or endometritis  



 Following a diagnosis of PID or endometritis, or suspected PID or endometritis, perform appropriate testing for sexually transmitted infection and initiate antibiotic therapy promptly. LILETTA does not need to be removed immediately if the woman needs ongoing contraception (1). In the LILETTA clinical trial, 12 of the 14 women who developed PID or endometritis were successfully treated without removal of LILETTA.



 Reassess the woman in 48-72 hours. If no clinical improvement occurs, continue antibiotics and consider removal of LILETTA. If the woman wants to discontinue use, remove LILETTA after antibiotics have been started to avoid the potential risk for bacterial spread resulting from the removal procedure. Guidelines for PID or endometritis treatment are available from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Atlanta, Georgia (1).



  Actinomycosis  



 Actinomycosis has been associated with IUS use. Symptomatic women with known actinomycosis infection should have LILETTA removed and receive antibiotics. Actinomycetes can be found in the genital tract cultures in healthy women without IUSs. The significance of actinomyces-like organisms on Pap test in an asymptomatic IUS user is unknown, and so this finding alone does not always require LILETTA removal and treatment. When possible, confirm a Pap test diagnosis with cultures.



     5.5        Perforation  



   Perforation (total or partial, including penetration/embedment of LILETTA in the uterine wall or cervix) may occur, most often during insertion, although the perforation may not be detected until sometime later. Perforation may reduce contraceptive efficacy and result in pregnancy. This may be associated with severe pain and continued bleeding.  



  The incidence of perforation during or following LILETTA insertion in the clinical trial, which excluded breastfeeding women, was 0.1%.  



  If perforation is suspected the IUS should be removed as soon as possible, surgery may be required.  Delayed detection or removal of LILETTA in case of perforation may result in migration outside the uterine cavity, adhesions, peritonitis, intestinal perforations, intestinal obstruction, abscesses, and erosion of adjacent viscera.  



  In a large prospective comparative non-interventional cohort study with another IUS the incidence of uterine perforation was reported as 6.3 per 1,000 insertions for lactating women, compared to 1.0 per 1,000 insertions for non-lactating women.  



  The risk of perforation may be increased if LILETTA is inserted when the uterus is fixed retroverted or not completely involuted during the post-partum period. Delay LILETTA insertion a minimum of six weeks or until involution is complete following a delivery or a second trimester abortion.  



     5.6        Expulsion  



  Partial or complete expulsion of LILETTA may occur, resulting in the loss of contraceptive protection. In the clinical trial with LILETTA, an overall expulsion rate of 3.7% was reported, with a rate of 2.1% in nulliparous women and 5.7% in parous women. Expulsion may be associated with symptoms of bleeding or pain, or it may be asymptomatic and go unnoticed. LILETTA typically decreases menstrual bleeding over time; therefore, an increase in menstrual bleeding may be indicative of an expulsion.



 The risk of expulsion may be increased when the uterus is not completely involuted at the time of insertion. Delay LILETTA insertion a minimum of 6 weeks or until uterine involution is complete following a delivery or a second trimester abortion. 



 Remove a partially expelled LILETTA. If expulsion has occurred, a new LILETTA may be inserted within 7 days after the onset of a menstrual period after pregnancy has been ruled out.



     5.7        Ovarian Cysts  



  Because the contraceptive effect of LILETTA is mainly due to its local effects within the uterus, ovulatory cycles with follicular rupture usually occur in women of fertile age using LILETTA. Sometimes atresia of the follicle is delayed and the follicle may continue to grow. Most ovarian cysts that occur during use of LNG-releasing IUSs are asymptomatic and disappear spontaneously during two to three months of observation. Cysts that cause clinical symptoms can result in pelvic or abdominal pain or dyspareunia. Symptomatic ovarian cysts occurred in 4.3% of subjects using LILETTA, and 0.3% of subjects discontinued use of LILETTA because of an ovarian cyst.



 Evaluate persistent ovarian cysts. Surgical intervention is not usually required, but may be necessary in some cases. Discuss this risk with patients who choose to use LILETTA.



     5.8        Bleeding Pattern Alterations  



  LILETTA can alter the bleeding pattern and result in spotting, irregular bleeding, heavy bleeding, oligomenorrhea, and amenorrhea. During the first three to six months of LILETTA use, the number of bleeding and spotting days may be increased and bleeding patterns may be irregular. Thereafter, the number of bleeding and spotting days usually decreases but bleeding may remain irregular.



 In the LILETTA clinical trial, amenorrhea developed in approximately 19% of LILETTA users by the end of the first year of use, in 27% by the end of the second year of use, in 37% by the end of the third year of use and 41% by the end of the fourth year of use. In the trial, 2.2% of LILETTA subjects discontinued due to bleeding complaints. Table 2 shows the bleeding and spotting days based on 28-day cycle equivalents.

  Number of spotting days    9.0              5.9              4.3              4.2              3.2              3.6              2.7              3.4              1.9              2.8               
                 Note: Includes all LILETTA subjects.
 

 In the LILETTA clinical trial, 429 of 439 (97.7%) women evaluated experienced menses after LILETTA removal. Excluding nine women who became pregnant or had a hysterectomy before having a return of their menses, 429 of 430 (99.8%) had a return of their menses, 99.1% within three months.



 If a significant change in bleeding develops during prolonged use, take appropriate diagnostic measures to rule out endometrial pathology. Consider the possibility of pregnancy if menstruation does not occur within six weeks of the onset of a previous menstruation. Once pregnancy has been excluded, repeated pregnancy tests are generally not necessary in amenorrheic women unless indicated, for example, by other signs of pregnancy or by pelvic pain.



     5.9        Breast Cancer  



  Women who currently have or have had breast cancer, or have a suspicion of breast cancer, should not use hormonal contraception, including LILETTA, because some breast cancers are hormone-sensitive [   see Contraindications   (     4     )   ]  .



 Spontaneous reports of breast cancer have been received during postmarketing experience with another LNG-releasing IUS. Observational studies have not provided consistent evidence of an increased risk of breast cancer with use of a LNG-releasing IUS.



     5.10        Clinical Considerations for Use and Removal  



  Obtain a complete medical and social history, including partner status, to determine conditions that might influence the selection of an IUS for contraception.



 Because irregular bleeding/spotting is common during the first months of LILETTA use, exclude endometrial pathology (polyps or cancer) prior to the insertion of LILETTA in women with persistent or uncharacteristic bleeding.



 Special attention must be given to ascertaining whether the woman is at increased risk of infection (for example, leukemia, acquired immune deficiency syndrome [AIDS], IV drug abuse), or has a history of PID unless there has been a subsequent intrauterine pregnancy.  LILETTA does not protect against HIV/STI transmission.  [See   Warnings and Precautions   (     5.4     )]   .  



 Use LILETTA with caution after careful assessment if any of the following conditions exist, and consider removal of the IUS if any of them arise during use:



 *  Coagulopathy or use of anticoagulants 
 *  Migraine, focal migraine with asymmetrical visual loss or other symptoms indicating transient cerebral ischemia 
 *  Exceptionally severe or frequent headache 
 *  Marked increase of blood pressure 
 *  Severe arterial disease such as stroke or myocardial infarction 
    In addition, consider removing LILETTA if any of the following conditions arise during use [   see Contraindications   (     4     )   ]  :
 

 *  Uterine or cervical malignancy 
 *  Jaundice 
    If the threads are not visible or are significantly shortened, they may have broken or retracted into the cervical canal or uterus. Consider the possibility that the IUS may have been displaced, (for example, expelled or perforated the uterus) [   see Warnings and Precautions (     5.5     ,     5.6     )   ]  . Exclude pregnancy and verify the location of LILETTA, for example, by sonography, by X-ray, or by gentle exploration of the cervical canal with a suitable instrument  [   see   Dosage and Administration       (     2.6     )]   .  If LILETTA is displaced, remove it. A new LILETTA may be inserted at that time or during the next menses if it is certain that conception has not occurred. If LILETTA is in place with no evidence of perforation, no intervention is indicated.
