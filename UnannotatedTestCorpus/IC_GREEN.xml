   EXCERPT:    *  Deaths due to anaphylaxis have been reported following IC-GREEN  (r)  administration during cardiac catheterization. (  5.1  ) 
 *  IC-GREEN  (r)  is unstable in aqueous solution and must be used within 6 hours. (  5.2  )

   5.1 Anaphylaxis



  Deaths from anaphylaxis have been reported following IC-GREEN  (r)  administration during cardiac catheterization.



    5.2 Drug Instability



  IC-GREEN  (r)  is unstable in aqueous solution and must be used within 6 hours. However, the dye is stable in plasma and whole blood so that samples obtained in discontinuous sampling techniques may be read hours later. Sterile techniques should be used in handling the dye solution as well as in the performance of the dilution curves. If a precipitate is present, discard the solution.



    5.3 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions



  Radioactive iodine uptake studies should not be performed for at least a week following the use of IC-GREEN  (r)  .
