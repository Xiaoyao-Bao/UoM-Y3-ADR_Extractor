  EXCERPT:     To report suspected adverse reactions, contact Par Pharmaceutical Inc. at 1-800-828-9393 or www.parpharm.com or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.  



 Discontinuation because of adverse reactions occurred in 4% of amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride capsules-treated patients and 3% of placebo-treated patients. The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride capsules were cough and edema. (  6  )



 

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates.



 Amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride capsules has been evaluated for safety in over 2,991 patients with hypertension; over 500 of these patients were treated for at least 6 months, and over 400 were treated for more than 1 year.



 In a pooled analysis of 5 placebo-controlled trials involving amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride capsules doses up to 5/20, the reported side effects were generally mild and transient, and there was no relationship between side effects and age, sex, race, or duration of therapy. Discontinuation of therapy due to side effects was required in approximately 4% of patients treated with amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride capsules and in 3% of patients treated with placebo.



 The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride capsules in these studies were cough and edema (including angioedema).



 The peripheral edema associated with amlodipine use is dose-dependent. When benazepril is added to a regimen of amlodipine, the incidence of edema is substantially reduced.



 The addition of benazepril to a regimen of amlodipine should not be expected to provide additional antihypertensive effect in African-Americans. However, all patient groups benefit from the reduction in amlodipine-induced edema.



 The side effects considered possibly or probably related to study drug that occurred in these trials in more than 1% of patients treated with amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride capsules are shown in the table below. Cough was the only adverse event with at least possible relationship to treatment that was more common on amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride capsules (3.3%) than on placebo (0.2%).

           The incidence of edema was greater in patients treated with amlodipine monotherapy (5.1%) than in patients treated with amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride capsules (2.1%) or placebo (2.2%).
 

 Other side effects considered possibly or probably related to study drug that occurred in U.S. placebo-controlled trials of patients treated with amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride capsules or in postmarketing experience were the following:



     Body as a Whole:    Asthenia and fatigue.



     CNS:    Insomnia, nervousness, anxiety, tremor, and decreased libido.



     Dermatologic:    Flushing, hot flashes, rash, skin nodule, and dermatitis.



     Digestive:    Dry mouth, nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia, and esophagitis.



     Hematologic:    Neutropenia



     Metabolic and Nutritional:    Hypokalemia.



     Musculoskeletal:    Back pain, musculoskeletal pain, cramps, and muscle cramps.



     Respiratory:    Pharyngitis.



     Urogenital:    Sexual problems such as impotence, and polyuria.



 Monotherapies of benazepril and amlodipine have been evaluated for safety in clinical trials in over 6,000 and 11,000 patients, respectively. The observed adverse reactions to the monotherapies in these trials were similar to those seen in trials of amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride capsules.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 In postmarketing experience with benazepril, there have been rare reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, pemphigus, and thrombocytopenia, paresthesia, dysgeusia, orthostatic symptoms and hypotension, angina pectoris and arrhythmia, pruritus, photosensitivity reaction, arthralgia, arthritis, myalgia, BUN increase, serum creatinine increased, renal impairment, impaired vision, agranulocytosis, neutropenia.



 Rare reports in association with use of amlodipine: gingival hyperplasia, tachycardia, jaundice, and hepatic enzyme elevations (mostly consistent with cholestasis severe enough to require hospitalization) leucocytopenia, allergic reaction, hyperglycemia, dysgeusia, hypoestheia, paresthesia, syncope, peripheral neuropathy, hypertonia, visual impairment, diplopia, hypotension, vasculitis, rhinitis, gastritis, hyperhidrosis, pruritus, skin discoloration, urticaria, erythema, multiform, muscle spasms, arthralgia, micturition disorder, nocturia, erectile dysfunction, malaise, weight decrease or gain.



 Other potentially important adverse experiences attributed to other ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers include: eosinophilic pneumonitis (ACE inhibitors) and gynecomastia (CCBs). Other infrequently reported events included chest pain, ventricular extrasystole, gout, neuritis, tinnitus, alopecia, upper respiratory tract infection, palpitations and somnolence.

  BOXED WARNING

    WARNING:   FETAL TOXICITY  



   When pregnancy is detected, discontinue amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride capsules as soon as possible (  5.4  ).  Drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system can cause injury and death to the developing fetus (  5.4  )

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *    Watch for anaphylactoid reactions, including angioedema (head, neck or intestinal). 
 *    Warn patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease about the risk of myocardial infarction or increased angina (  5.2  ) 
 *    Assess for hypotension and hyperkalemia (  5.3  and  5.7  ) 
 *    Avoid fetal or neonatal exposure (  5.4  ) 
 *    Titrate slowly in patients with impaired hepatic (  5.5  ) or severely impaired renal (  5.6  ) function. 
    
 

   5.1 Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions



  Presumably because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors affect the metabolism of eicosanoids and polypeptides, including endogenous bradykinin, patients receiving ACE inhibitors (including amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride capsules) may be subject to a variety of adverse reactions, some of them serious. These reactions usually occur after one of the first few doses of the ACE inhibitor, but they sometimes do not appear until after months of therapy. Black patients receiving ACE inhibitors have a higher incidence of angioedema compared to nonblacks.



  Head and Neck Angioedema:  Angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis, and larynx has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. In U.S. clinical trials, symptoms consistent with angioedema were seen in none of the subjects who received placebo and in about 0.5% of the subjects who received benazepril. Angioedema associated with laryngeal edema can be fatal. If laryngeal stridor or angioedema of the face, tongue, or glottis occurs, discontinue treatment with amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride capsules and treat immediately. When involvement of the tongue, glottis, or larynx appears likely to cause airway obstruction, appropriate therapy, e.g., administer subcutaneous epinephrine injection 1:1000 (0.3-0.5 mL), promptly. [see  Adverse Reactions    (  6  )].



  Intestinal Angioedema:  Intestinal angioedema has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. These patients presented with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vomiting); in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C-1 esterase levels were normal. The angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angioedema should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain.



  Anaphylactoid Reactions During Desensitization:  Two patients undergoing desensitizing treatment with hymenoptera venom while receiving ACE inhibitors sustained life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions. In the same patients, these reactions were avoided when ACE inhibitors were temporarily withheld, but they reappeared upon inadvertent rechallenge.



  Anaphylactoid Reactions During Membrane Exposure:  Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in patients dialyzed with high-flux membranes and treated concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor. Anaphylactoid reactions have also been reported in patients undergoing low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate absorption.



    5.2 Increased Angina and/or Myocardial Infarction



  Worsening agina and acute myocardial infarction can develop after starting or increasing the dose of amlodipine, particularly in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease.



    5.3 Patients with Aortic and Mitral Valve Stenosis, Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy



  As with all other vasodilators, special caution is required when using amplodipine in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.



    5.4 Hypotension



  Amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride capsules can cause symptomatic hypotension. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume or salt depleted as a result of diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, or vomiting. Volume and/or salt depletion should be corrected before starting therapy with benazepril. If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and if necessary given physiological saline i.v. Treatment with benazepril can be continued once blood pressure and volume have returned to normal.



 In patients with congestive heart failure, with or without associated renal insufficiency, ACE inhibitor therapy may cause excessive hypotension, which may be associated with oliguria, azotemia, and (rarely) with acute renal failure and death. In such patients, start amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride capsules therapy under close medical supervision; follow closely for the first 2 weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of the benazepril component is increased or a diuretic is added or its dose increased.



 Symptomatic hypotension is also possible in patients with severe aortic stenosis.



    5.5 Fetal Toxicity



   Pregnancy Category D  



 Use of drugs that act on renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride capsules as soon as possible [see  Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  )    ].



    5.6 Hepatitis and Hepatic Failure



  There have been rare reports of predominantly cholestatic hepatitis and isolated cases of acute liver failure, some of them fatal, in patients on ACE inhibitors. The mechanism is not understood. Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice or marked elevation of hepatic enzymes should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and be kept under medical surveillance.



    5.7 Impaired Renal Function



  Monitor renal function periodically in patients treated with Amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride capsules. Changes in renal function, including acute renal failure, can be caused by drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin system. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, severe heart failure, post-myocardial infarction or volume depletion) or who are on NSAIDS or angiotensin receptor blockers may be at a particular risk of developing acute renal failure on Amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride capsules. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on Amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride capsules.



    5.8 Hyperkalemia



  Monitor serum potassium periodically in patients treated with Amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride capsules. Drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, and/or potassium-containing salt substitutes. In U.S. placebo-controlled trials of Amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride capsules, hyperkalemia (serum potassium at least 0.5 mEq/L greater than the upper limit of normal) not present at baseline occurred in approximately 1.5% of hypertensive patients receiving Amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride capsules. Increases in serum potassium were generally reversible.



    5.9 Cough



  Presumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, generally resolving after discontinuation of therapy. Consider ACE inhibitor-induced cough in the differential diagnosis of cough.



    5.10 Surgery/Anesthesia



  In patients undergoing surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, benazepril will block the angiotensin II formation that could otherwise occur secondary to compensatory renin release. Hypotension that occurs as a result of this mechanism can be corrected by volume expansion.
