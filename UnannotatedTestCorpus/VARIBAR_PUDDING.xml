    <Section id="S1" name="adverse reactions">    6  ADVERSE REACTIONS

  The following adverse reactions have been identified from spontaneous reporting or clinical studies of barium sulfate administered orally. Because the reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure



 *  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramping 
 *  Serious adverse reactions and fatalities include aspiration pneumonitis, barium sulfate impaction, intestinal perforation with consequent peritonitis and granuloma formation, vasovagal and syncopal episodes 
      EXCERPT:   Common adverse reactions include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramping (  6  )
 

   To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Bracco Diagnostics at 1-800-257-5181 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.

   EXCERPT:    *  Hypersensitivity reactions: Emergency equipment and trained personnel should be immediately available (  5.1  ) 
 *  Intra-abdominal leakage: May occur with conditions which increase the risk for perforation such as - carcinomas, GI fistula, Inflammatory bowel disease, gastric or duodenal ulcer, appendicitis, diverticulitis, or severe stenosis or obstructing lesions of the GI tract (  5.2  ) 
 *  Obstruction: Patients should maintain adequate hydration in days following barium sulfate procedure to avoid obstruction or impaction by baroliths (  5.3  ) 
 *  Aspiration Pneumonitis: Aspiration may occur during the modified barium swallow examination, monitor the patient for aspiration (  5.4  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions



  Barium sulfate preparations contain a number of excipients, including natural and artificial flavors and may induce serious hypersensitivity reactions. The manifestations include: hypotension, bronchospasm and other respiratory impairments, and dermal reactions including rashes, urticaria, and itching. A history of bronchial asthma, atopy, food allergies, or a previous reaction to a contrast agent may increase the risk for hypersensitivity reactions. Emergency equipment and trained personnel should be immediately available for treatment of a hypersensitivity reaction.



    5.2 Intra-abdominal Barium Leakage



  Administration of VARIBAR PUDDING may result in leakage of barium from the GI tract in the presence of conditions and ailments that increase the risk of perforation such as known carcinomas, GI fistula, inflammatory bowel disease, gastric or duodenal ulcer, appendicitis, or diverticulitis, and in patients with a severe stenosis at any level of the gastrointestinal tract, especially if it is distal to the stomach. The barium leakage has been associated with peritonitis and granuloma formation. The use of VARIBAR PUDDING is contraindicated in patients at high risk of perforation of the GI tract [see Contraindications (  4  )]  .



    5.3 Delayed Gastrointestinal Transit and Obstruction



  Orally administered barium sulfate may accumulate proximal to a constricting lesion of the colon, causing obstruction or impaction with development of baroliths (inspissated barium associated with feces) and may lead to abdominal pain, appendicitis, bowel obstruction, or rarely perforation. Patients with the following conditions are at higher risk for developing obstruction or baroliths: severe stenosis at any level of the GI tract, with impaired gastrointestinal motility, electrolyte imbalance, dehydration, on a low residue diet, taking medications that delay GI motility, constipation, pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis or Hirschsprung disease, and the elderly. [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.4  ,  8.5  )]  . To reduce the risk of delayed GI transit and obstruction, patients should maintain adequate hydration after the barium sulfate procedure and consider the administration of laxatives.



    5.4 Aspiration Pneumonitis



  Oral administration of barium is associated with aspiration pneumonitis, especially in patients with a history of food aspiration or with compromised swallowing mechanism. Vomiting following oral administration of barium sulfate may lead to aspiration pneumonitis. In patients at risk for aspiration, begin the procedure with a small ingested volume of VARIBAR PUDDING. The use of VARIBAR PUDDING is contraindicated in patients with trachea-esophageal fistula [see Contraindications (  4  )]  . Monitor the patient closely for aspiration, discontinue administration of VARIBAR PUDDING if aspiration is suspected, and monitor for development of aspiration pneumonitis.



    5.5 Systemic Embolization



  Barium sulfate products may occasionally intravasate into the venous drainage of the large bowel and enter the circulation as a "barium embolus" leading to potentially fatal complications which include systemic and pulmonary embolism, disseminated intravascular coagulation, septicemia and prolonged severe hypotension. Although this complication is exceedingly uncommon after oral administration of a barium sulfate suspension, monitor patients for potential intravasation when administering barium sulfate.
