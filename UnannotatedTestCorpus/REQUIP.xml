  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug (or of another development program of a different formulation of the same drug) and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



   Parkinson's Disease  



 During the premarketing development of REQUIP, patients received REQUIP either without L-dopa (early Parkinson's disease trials) or as concomitant therapy with L-dopa (advanced Parkinson's disease trials). Because these 2 populations may have differential risks for various adverse reactions, this section will in general present adverse reaction data for these 2 populations separately.



   Early Parkinson's Disease (without L-dopa):  In the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease, the most commonly observed adverse reactions in patients treated with REQUIP (incidence at least 5% greater than placebo) were nausea, somnolence, dizziness, syncope, asthenic condition (i.e., asthenia, fatigue, and/or malaise), viral infection, leg edema, vomiting, and dyspepsia.



 Approximately 24% of patients treated with REQUIP who participated in the double-blind, placebo-controlled early Parkinson's disease (without L-dopa) trials discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions compared with 13% of patients who received placebo. The most common adverse reactions in patients treated with REQUIP (incidence at least 2% greater than placebo) of sufficient severity to cause discontinuation were nausea and dizziness.



   Table 3  lists treatment-emergent adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients with early Parkinson's disease (without L-dopa) treated with REQUIP participating in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common than the incidence for placebo-treated patients. In these trials, either REQUIP or placebo was used as early therapy (i.e., without L-dopa).

      Advanced Parkinson's Disease (with L-dopa):  In the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with advanced-stage Parkinson's disease, the most commonly observed adverse reactions in patients treated with REQUIP (incidence at least 5% greater than placebo) were dyskinesia, somnolence, nausea, dizziness, confusion, hallucinations, increased sweating, and headache.
 

 Approximately 24% of patients who received REQUIP in the double-blind, placebo-controlled advanced Parkinson's disease (with L-dopa) trials discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions compared with 18% of patients who received placebo. The most common adverse reaction in patients treated with REQUIP (incidence at least 2% greater than placebo) of sufficient severity to cause discontinuation was dizziness.



   Table 4  lists treatment-emergent adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (with L-dopa) treated with REQUIP who participated in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common than the incidence for placebo-treated patients. In these trials, either REQUIP or placebo was used as an adjunct to L-dopa.

      Restless Legs Syndrome  
 

 In the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with RLS, the most commonly observed adverse reactions in patients treated with REQUIP (incidence at least 5% greater than placebo) were nausea, vomiting, somnolence, dizziness, and asthenic condition (i.e., asthenia, fatigue, and/or malaise).



 Approximately 5% of patients treated with REQUIP who participated in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in the treatment of RLS discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions compared with 4% of patients who received placebo. The most common adverse reaction in patients treated with REQUIP (incidence at least 2% greater than placebo) of sufficient severity to cause discontinuation was nausea.



   Table 5  lists treatment-emergent adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients with RLS treated with REQUIP participating in the 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common than the incidence for placebo-treated patients.

   5.1 Falling Asleep during Activities of Daily Living and Somnolence



  Patients treated with REQUIP have reported falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living, including driving or operating machinery, which sometimes resulted in accidents. Although many of these patients reported somnolence while on REQUIP, some perceived that they had no warning signs, such as excessive drowsiness, and believed that they were alert immediately prior to the event. Some have reported these events more than 1 year after initiation of treatment.



 In controlled clinical trials, somnolence was commonly reported in patients receiving REQUIP and was more frequent in Parkinson's disease (up to 40% REQUIP, 6% placebo) than in RLS (12% REQUIP, 6% placebo) [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  .



 It has been reported that falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living usually occurs in a setting of pre-existing somnolence, although patients may not give such a history. For this reason, prescribers should reassess patients for drowsiness or sleepiness, especially since some of the events occur well after the start of treatment. Prescribers should also be aware that patients may not acknowledge drowsiness or sleepiness until directly questioned about drowsiness or sleepiness during specific activities.



 Before initiating treatment with REQUIP, patients should be advised of the potential to develop drowsiness and specifically asked about factors that may increase the risk with REQUIP such as concomitant sedating medications or alcohol, the presence of sleep disorders (other than RLS), and concomitant medications that increase ropinirole plasma levels (e.g., ciprofloxacin) [see Drug Interactions (  7.1  )]  . If a patient develops significant daytime sleepiness or episodes of falling asleep during activities that require active participation (e.g., driving a motor vehicle, conversations, eating), REQUIP should ordinarily be discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  ,  2.3  )]  . If a decision is made to continue REQUIP, patients should be advised to not drive and to avoid other potentially dangerous activities. There is insufficient information to establish that dose reduction will eliminate episodes of falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living .  



    5.2 Syncope



  Syncope, sometimes associated with bradycardia, was observed in association with treatment with REQUIP in both patients with Parkinson's disease and patients with RLS. In controlled clinical trials in patients with Parkinson's disease, syncope was observed more frequently in patients receiving REQUIP than in patients receiving placebo (early Parkinson's disease without levodopa [L-dopa]: REQUIP 12%, placebo 1%; advanced Parkinson's disease: REQUIP 3%, placebo 2%). Syncope was reported in 1% of patients treated with REQUIP for RLS in 12-week, placebo-controlled clinical trials compared with 0.2% of patients treated with placebo [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . Most cases occurred more than 4 weeks after initiation of therapy with REQUIP and were usually associated with a recent increase in dose.



 Because the trials conducted with REQUIP excluded patients with significant cardiovascular disease, patients with significant cardiovascular disease should be treated with caution.



 Approximately 4% of patients with Parkinson's disease enrolled in Phase 1 trials had syncope following a 1-mg dose of REQUIP. In 2 trials in patients with RLS that used a forced-titration regimen and orthostatic challenge with intensive blood pressure monitoring, 2% of RLS patients treated with REQUIP compared with 0% of patients receiving placebo reported syncope.



 In Phase 1 trials including healthy volunteers, the incidence of syncope was 2%. Of note, 1 subject with syncope developed hypotension, bradycardia, and sinus arrest; the subject recovered spontaneously without intervention.



    5.3 Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension



  Patients with Parkinson's disease may have impaired ability to respond normally to a fall in blood pressure after standing from lying down or seated position. Patients on REQUIP should be monitored for signs and symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation, and should be informed of the risk for syncope and hypotension [see Patient Counseling Information (  17  )]  .



 Although the clinical trials were not designed to systematically monitor blood pressure, there were individual reported cases of orthostatic hypotension in early Parkinson's disease (without L-dopa) in patients treated with REQUIP. Most of these cases occurred more than 4 weeks after initiation of therapy with REQUIP and were usually associated with a recent increase in dose.



 In 12-week, placebo-controlled trials of patients with RLS, the adverse event orthostatic hypotension was reported by 4 of 496 patients (0.8%) treated with REQUIP compared with 2 of 500 patients (0.4%) receiving placebo.



 In 2 Phase 2 trials in patients with RLS, 14 of 55 patients (25%) receiving REQUIP experienced an adverse event of hypotension or orthostatic hypotension compared with none of the 27 patients receiving placebo. In these trials, 11 of the 55 patients (20%) receiving REQUIP and 3 of the 26 patients (12%) who had post-dose blood pressure assessments following placebo experienced an orthostatic blood pressure decrease of at least 40 mm Hg systolic and/or at least 20 mm Hg diastolic.



 In Phase 1 trials of REQUIP with healthy volunteers who received single doses on more than one occasion without titration, 7% had documented symptomatic orthostatic hypotension. These episodes appeared mainly at doses above 0.8 mg, and these doses are higher than the starting doses recommended for patients with either Parkinson's disease or with RLS. In most of these individuals, the hypotension was accompanied by bradycardia but did not develop into syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )]  .



 Although dizziness is not a specific manifestation of hypotension or orthostatic hypotension, patients with hypotension or orthostatic hypotension frequently reported dizziness. In controlled clinical trials, dizziness was a common adverse reaction in patients receiving REQUIP and was more frequent in patients with Parkinson's disease or with RLS receiving REQUIP than in patients receiving placebo (early Parkinson's disease without L-dopa: REQUIP 40%, placebo 22%; advanced Parkinson's disease: REQUIP 26%, placebo 16%; RLS: REQUIP 11%, placebo 5%). Dizziness of sufficient severity to cause trial discontinuation of REQUIP was 4% in patients with early Parkinson's disease without L-dopa, 3% in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, and 1% in patients with RLS. [See Adverse Reactions (  6.1  ).]  



    5.4 Hallucinations/Psychotic-Like Behavior



  In double-blind, placebo-controlled, early-therapy trials in patients with Parkinson's disease who were not treated with L-dopa, 5.2% (8 of 157) of patients treated with REQUIP reported hallucinations, compared with 1.4% of patients on placebo (2 of 147). Among those patients receiving both REQUIP and L-dopa in advanced Parkinson's disease trials, 10.1% (21 of 208) were reported to experience hallucinations, compared with 4.2% (5 of 120) of patients treated with placebo and L-dopa.



 The incidence of hallucination was increased in elderly patients (i.e., older than 65 years) treated with extended-release REQUIP [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.5  )]  .



 Postmarketing reports indicate that patients may experience new or worsening mental status and behavioral changes, which may be severe, including psychotic-like behavior during treatment with REQUIP or after starting or increasing the dose of REQUIP. Other drugs prescribed to improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease can have similar effects on thinking and behavior. This abnormal thinking and behavior can consist of one or more of a variety of manifestations including paranoid ideation, delusions, hallucinations, confusion, psychotic-like behavior, disorientation, aggressive behavior, agitation, and delirium.



 Patients with a major psychotic disorder should ordinarily not be treated with REQUIP because of the risk of exacerbating the psychosis. In addition, certain medications used to treat psychosis may exacerbate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and may decrease the effectiveness of REQUIP [see Drug Interactions (  7.3  )].  



    5.5 Dyskinesia



  REQUIP may cause or exacerbate pre-existing dyskinesia in patients treated with L-dopa for Parkinson's disease.



 In double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in advanced Parkinson's disease, dyskinesia was much more common in patients treated with REQUIP than in those treated with placebo. Among those patients receiving both REQUIP and L-dopa in advanced Parkinson's disease trials, 34% were reported to experience dyskinesia, compared with 13% of patients treated with placebo [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )].  



 Decreasing the dose of dopaminergic medications may ameliorate this adverse reaction.



    5.6 Impulse Control/Compulsive Behaviors



  Reports suggest that patients can experience intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money, binge or compulsive eating, and/or other intense urges, and the inability to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications, including REQUIP, that increase central dopaminergic tone and that are generally used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and RLS. In some cases, although not all, these urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal, it is important for prescribers to specifically ask patients or their caregivers about the development of new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending, binge or compulsive eating, or other urges while being treated with REQUIP. Physicians should consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges while taking REQUIP.



    5.7 Withdrawal-Emergent Hyperpyrexia and Confusion



  A symptom complex resembling the neuroleptic malignant syndrome (characterized by elevated temperature, muscular rigidity, altered consciousness, and autonomic instability), with no other obvious etiology, has been reported in association with rapid dose reduction of, withdrawal of, or changes in, dopaminergic therapy. Therefore, it is recommended that the dose be tapered at the end of treatment with REQUIP as a prophylactic measure [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  ,  2.3  )]  .



    5.8 Melanoma



  Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with Parkinson's disease have a higher risk (2-fold to approximately 6-fold higher) of developing melanoma than the general population. Whether the increased risk observed was due to Parkinson's disease or other factors, such as drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease, is unclear.



 For the reasons stated above, patients and providers are advised to monitor for melanomas frequently and on a regular basis when using REQUIP for any indication. Ideally, periodic skin examinations should be performed by appropriately qualified individuals (e.g., dermatologists).



    5.9 Augmentation and Early-Morning Rebound in Restless Legs Syndrome



  Augmentation is a phenomenon in which dopaminergic medication causes a worsening of symptom severity above and beyond the level at the time the medication was started. The symptoms of augmentation may include the earlier onset of symptoms in the evening (or even the afternoon), increase in symptoms, and spread of symptoms to involve other extremities. Augmentation has been described during therapy for RLS. Rebound refers to new onset of symptoms in the early morning hours. Augmentation and/or early-morning rebound have been observed in a postmarketing trial of REQUIP. If augmentation or early-morning rebound occurs, the use of REQUIP should be reviewed and dosage adjustment or discontinuation of treatment should be considered. When discontinuing REQUIP in patients with RLS, gradual reduction of the daily dose is recommended whenever possible [see Dosage and Administration  2.3  ]  .



    5.10 Fibrotic Complications



  Cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, pericarditis, and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in some patients treated with ergot-derived dopaminergic agents. While these complications may resolve when the drug is discontinued, complete resolution does not always occur.



 Although these adverse reactions are believed to be related to the ergoline structure of these compounds, whether other, non-ergot-derived dopamine agonists, such as ropinirole, can cause them is unknown.



 Cases of possible fibrotic complications, including pleural effusion, pleural fibrosis, interstitial lung disease, and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in the development program and postmarketing experience for ropinirole. While the evidence is not sufficient to establish a causal relationship between ropinirole and these fibrotic complications, a contribution of ropinirole cannot be excluded.



    5.11 Retinal Pathology



  Retinal degeneration was observed in albino rats in the 2-year carcinogenicity study at all doses tested. The lowest dose tested (1.5 mg/kg/day) is less than the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) for Parkinson's disease (24 mg/day) on a mg/m  2  basis. Retinal degeneration was not observed in a 3-month study in pigmented rats, in a 2-year carcinogenicity study in albino mice, or in 1-year studies in monkeys or albino rats. The significance of this effect for humans has not been established, but involves disruption of a mechanism that is universally present in vertebrates (e.g., disk shedding).



 Ocular electroretinogram assessments were conducted during a 2-year, double-blind, multicenter, flexible dose, L-dopa-controlled clinical trial of ropinirole in patients with Parkinson's disease; 156 patients (78 on ropinirole, mean dose: 11.9 mg/day, and 78 on L-dopa, mean dose: 555.2 mg/day) were evaluated for evidence of retinal dysfunction through electroretinograms. There was no clinically meaningful difference between the treatment groups in retinal function over the duration of the trial.



    5.12 Binding to Melanin



  Ropinirole binds to melanin-containing tissues (e.g., eyes, skin) in pigmented rats. After a single dose, long-term retention of drug was demonstrated, with a half-life in the eye of 20 days.
