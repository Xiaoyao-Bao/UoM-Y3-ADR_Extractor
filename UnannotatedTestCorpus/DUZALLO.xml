  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



     Lesinurad in Combination With Allopurinol  



 In 2 randomized, placebo-controlled studies (Studies 1 and 2), a total of 405, 401, and 407 patients with gout were treated with lesinurad 200 mg, lesinurad 400 mg, or placebo, respectively, once daily in combination with allopurinol (200 mg to 900 mg daily) for up to 12 months. The majority of patients in these studies received allopurinol daily doses of 200 mg or 300 mg (average dose of allopurinol in the studies was 310 mg), corresponding to the allopurinol doses contained in DUZALLO. The median duration of treatment with lesinurad in combination with allopurinol was 11.2 months. The mean age of the population was 52 years (range 18-82), and 95% were males. At baseline, 61% of the patient population showed mild or moderate renal impairment (eCLcr less than 90 mL/min) and 81% of patients had at least one co-morbid condition including hypertension (66%), hyperlipidemia (46%), diabetes (17%), and kidney stones (12%).



     Renal Events  



 Lesinurad causes an increase in renal uric acid excretion, which may lead to renal events including transient increases in serum creatinine, renal-related adverse reactions, and kidney stones. These renal events occurred more frequently in patients receiving lesinurad 400 mg than in patients receiving 200 mg [see    Warnings and Precautions (5.1)    ].



 The number of patients with serum creatinine elevations in the 12-month placebo-controlled trials in combination with allopurinol is shown in Table 1. Most of these elevations on lesinurad 200 mg in combination with allopurinol and lesinurad 400 mg in combination with allopurinol resolved without treatment interruption (Table 1).

          Renal-related adverse reactions, including blood creatinine increased and renal failure, and nephrolithiasis reported in patients receiving lesinurad 200 mg, lesinurad 400 mg, and placebo in combination with allopurinol are shown in Table 2 [see    Warnings and Precautions (5.1)    ]. The incidence of reports of "blood creatinine increased" was higher with lesinurad in combination with allopurinol and was highest with lesinurad 400 mg in combination with allopurinol. Renal-related adverse reactions by baseline renal function category are shown in Table 3 [see    Warnings and Precautions (5.1)    ]. Blood creatinine increased occurred more frequently in patients treated with lesinurad 400 mg in combination with allopurinol across baseline renal function categories (Table 3).

          Renal-related adverse reactions resulted in a similar discontinuation rate on lesinurad 200 mg in combination with allopurinol (1.0%) and allopurinol alone (1.0%) and a higher rate on lesinurad 400 mg in combination with allopurinol (3.2%). Serious renal-related adverse reactions were reported in patients on lesinurad 400 mg in combination with allopurinol (0.7%) and allopurinol alone (0.2%) and in no patients on lesinurad 200 mg in combination with allopurinol during the 12-month controlled period of the studies. Serious renal-related adverse reactions were reported with lesinurad 200 mg and lesinurad 400 mg in combination with allopurinol in the uncontrolled long-term extensions [see    Warnings and Precautions (5.1)    ].
 

     Cardiovascular Safety  



 Cardiovascular events and deaths were adjudicated as Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke) in the Phase 3 randomized controlled studies of lesinurad in combination with allopurinol. In the randomized controlled studies, the numbers of patients with adjudicated MACE (incidences per 100 patient-years of exposure) were: 2 (0.60) for placebo, 2 (0.61) for lesinurad 200 mg, and 6 (1.85) for lesinurad 400 mg when used in combination with allopurinol.



     Other Adverse Reactions  



 Adverse reactions occurring in 2% or more of patients on lesinurad in combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor and at least 1% greater than that observed in patients on placebo with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor were identified in the lesinurad development program. The incidence of these adverse reactions in controlled studies with lesinurad 200 mg in combination with allopurinol is summarized in Table 4.

           6.2 Postmarketing Experience
     Allopurinol  



 The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of allopurinol. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 The most frequent adverse reaction to allopurinol is skin rash [see    Warnings and Precautions (5.2)    ].

   5.1 Renal Events



  Adverse reactions related to renal function, including acute renal failure, can occur after initiating DUZALLO. Treatment with lesinurad 200 mg in combination with allopurinol was associated with an increased incidence of serum creatinine elevations, most of which were reversible [see   Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ]. A higher incidence of serum creatinine elevations and renal-related adverse reactions, including serious adverse reactions of acute renal failure, were observed with lesinurad 400 mg in combination with allopurinol, with the highest incidence when lesinurad was given alone. DUZALLO treatment should be interrupted if serum creatinine is elevated to greater than 2 times the value when lesinurad treatment was initiated. In patients who report symptoms that may indicate acute uric acid nephropathy including flank pain, nausea or vomiting, interrupt treatment and measure serum creatinine promptly. DUZALLO should not be restarted without another explanation for the serum creatinine abnormalities.



 DUZALLO should not be initiated in patients with an eCLcr less than 45 mL/min. Renal function should be evaluated prior to initiation of DUZALLO and periodically thereafter, as clinically indicated. More frequent renal function monitoring is recommended in patients with an eCLcr less than 60 mL/min [see   Renal Impairment (8.6)    ] or with serum creatinine elevations 1.5 to 2 times the value when lesinurad treatment was initiated.



 Some patients with pre-existing renal disease or poor urate clearance have shown a rise in BUN during administration of allopurinol.



    5.2 Skin Rash and Hypersensitivity



  Skin rash is a frequently reported adverse event in patients taking allopurinol [see   Adverse Reactions (6.2)    ]. In some instances, a skin rash may be followed by more severe hypersensitivity reactions associated with exfoliation, fever, lymphadenopathy, arthralgia and/or eosinophilia including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Associated vasculitis and tissue response may be manifested in various ways including hepatitis, renal impairment, seizures, and on rare occasions, death. The HLA-B*5801 allele is a genetic risk marker for severe skin reactions indicative of hypersensitivity to allopurinol.



 DUZALLO should be discontinued immediately at the first appearance of skin rash or other signs which may indicate an allergic reaction, and additional medical care should be provided as needed.



 Hypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol may be increased in patients with decreased renal function receiving thiazide diuretics and DUZALLO concurrently. For this reason, in this clinical setting, such combinations should be administered with caution and patients should be observed closely.



    5.3 Hepatotoxicity



  A few cases of reversible clinical hepatotoxicity have been reported in patients taking allopurinol, and in some patients, asymptomatic rises in serum alkaline phosphatase or serum transaminase have been observed. If anorexia, weight loss, or pruritus develops in patients on DUZALLO, evaluation of liver function should be performed. In patients with pre-existing liver disease, periodic liver function tests are recommended.



    5.4 Cardiovascular Events



  In clinical trials with lesinurad and allopurinol, major adverse cardiovascular events (cardiovascular deaths, non-fatal myocardial infarctions, and non-fatal strokes) were observed [see   Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ]. A causal relationship has not been established.



    5.5 Bone Marrow Depression



  Bone marrow depression has been reported in patients receiving allopurinol, most of whom received concomitant drugs with the potential for causing this reaction. This has occurred as early as six weeks to as long as six years after the initiation of allopurinol therapy. Rarely a patient may develop varying degrees of bone marrow depression, affecting one or more cell lines, while receiving allopurinol alone.



 Patients taking allopurinol and mercaptopurine or azathioprine require a reduction in dose to approximately one-third to one-fourth of the usual dose of mercaptopurine or azathioprine. Subsequent adjustment of doses of mercaptopurine or azathioprine should be made on the basis of therapeutic response and the appearance of toxic effects. Patients should be closely monitored for therapeutic response and the appearance of toxicity [see   Drug Interaction (7.2)    ].



    5.6 Increase in Prothrombin Time



  It has been reported that allopurinol prolongs the half-life of dicumarol, a coumarin anticoagulant. The prothrombin time should be reassessed periodically in patients receiving coumarin anticoagulants (dicumarol, warfarin) concomitantly with DUZALLO [see   Drug Interaction (7.2)    ].



    5.7 Drowsiness



  Occasional occurrence of drowsiness was reported in patients taking allopurinol. Patients should be alerted to the need for due caution when engaging in activities where alertness is mandatory [see   Patient Counseling Information (17)    ].
