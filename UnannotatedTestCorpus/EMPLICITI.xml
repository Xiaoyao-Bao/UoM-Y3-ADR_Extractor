  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



   EMPLICITI in Combination with Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone [ELOQUENT-2]  



 The safety data described in this section are based on the ELOQUENT-2 study, a randomized, open-label clinical trial in patients with previously treated multiple myeloma. In ELOQUENT-2, EMPLICITI 10 mg/kg was administered with lenalidomide and dexamethasone [  see  Clinical Studies (14)    ]. For adverse reaction evaluation, EMPLICITI combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone was compared with lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone.



 The mean age of the population was 66 years and 57% of patients were 65 years of age or older. Sixty percent (60%) of the population were male, 84% were white, 10% were Asian, and 4% were black. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status was 0 in 47%, 1 in 44%, and 2 in 9% of patients.



 These data reflect exposure of 318 patients to EMPLICITI and 317 to control with a median number of cycles of 19 for EMPLICITI and 14 for control.



 Serious adverse reactions were reported in 65% of patients treated on the EMPLICITI arm and 57% for patients treated on the control arm. The most frequent serious adverse reactions in the EMPLICITI arm compared to the control arm were: pneumonia (15% vs. 11%), pyrexia (7% vs. 5%), respiratory tract infection (3.1% vs. 1.3%), anemia (2.8% vs. 1.9%), pulmonary embolism (3.1% vs. 2.5%), and acute renal failure (2.5% vs. 1.9%).



 The proportion of patients who discontinued any component of the treatment regimen due to adverse reactions as listed below was similar for both treatment arms; 6.0% for patients treated on the EMPLICITI arm and 6.3% for patients treated on the control.



 Adverse reactions occurring at a frequency of 10% or higher in the EMPLICITI arm and 5% or higher than the lenalidomide and dexamethasone arm for the randomized trial in multiple myeloma are presented in Table 6.

           EMPLICITI in Combination with Pomalidomide and Dexamethasone [ELOQUENT-3]  
 

 The safety data described in this section are based on ELOQUENT-3, a randomized, open-label clinical trial in patients with previously treated multiple myeloma. In ELOQUENT-3, EMPLICITI 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg was administered with pomalidomide and dexamethasone [  see  Clinical Studies (14)    ]. For adverse reaction evaluation, EMPLICITI combined with pomalidomide and dexamethasone was compared with pomalidomide and dexamethasone alone.



 The mean age of the population was 66 years and 63% of patients were 65 years of age or older. Fifty-seven percent of the population were male, 78% were white, 20% were Asian, and none were black. The ECOG performance status was 0 in 43%, 1 in 46%, and 2 in 10% of patients. These data reflect exposure of 60 patients to EMPLICITI and 55 to control with a median number of cycles of 9 for EMPLICITI and 5 for control.



 Serious adverse reactions were reported in 22% of patients treated on the EMPLICITI arm and 15% for patients treated on the control arm. The most frequent serious adverse reactions in the EMPLICITI arm compared to the control arm were: pneumonia (13% vs. 11%) and respiratory tract infection (7% vs. 3.6%). The proportion of patients who discontinued any component of the treatment regimen due to adverse reactions were 5.0% of the patients in the EMPLICITI arm and 1.8% of the patients in the control arm.



 Adverse reactions occurring at a frequency of 10% or higher in the EMPLICITI arm and 5% or higher than the pomalidomide and dexamethasone arm for the randomized trial in multiple myeloma are presented in Table 9.

   6.2 Immunogenicity

  As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity to EMPLICITI. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of incidence of antibodies to EMPLICITI in the studies described below with the incidences of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading.



 Of 390 patients across four clinical studies including ELOQUENT-2 and in 53 patients in the ELOQUENT-3 trial, who were treated with EMPLICITI and evaluable for the presence of anti-product antibodies, 72 patients (18.5%) in the four clinical trials and 19 patients (36%) in the ELOQUENT-3 trial tested positive for treatment-emergent anti-product antibodies by an electrochemiluminescent (ECL) assay. In 63 (88%) of the 72 patients in the four clinical trials, anti-product antibodies occurred within the first 2 months of the initiation of EMPLICITI treatment and resolved by 2 to 4 months in 49 (78%) patients. In the ELOQUENT-3 trial, in all 19 patients, anti-product antibodies occurred within the first 2 months of the initiation of EMPLICITI treatment and were resolved by 2 to 3 months in 18 (85%) patients.



 Neutralizing antibodies post-treatment were detected in 19 of 299 patients in the four clinical trials and 2 of 53 patients in the ELOQUENT-3 trial who were evaluable for the presence of neutralizing antibodies.

   EXCERPT:    *    Infusion reactions: Premedication is required. Interrupt EMPLICITI for Grade 2 or higher and permanently discontinue for severe infusion reaction.  (    2.3  ,  2.4  ,  5.1)   
 *    Infections: Monitor for fever and other signs of infection and treat promptly.  (5.2)   
 *    Second Primary Malignancies (SPM): Higher incidences of SPM were observed in a controlled clinical trial of patients with multiple myeloma receiving EMPLICITI.  (5.3)   
 *    Hepatotoxicity: Monitor liver function and stop EMPLICITI if hepatotoxicity is suspected.  (5.4)   
 *    Interference with determination of complete response: EMPLICITI can interfere with assays used to monitor M-protein. This interference can impact the determination of complete response.  (5.5)   
    
 

   5.1 Infusion Reactions



   EMPLICITI can cause infusion reactions. Infusion reactions were reported in 10% of patients treated with EMPLICITI in the ELOQUENT-2 trial and 3.3% in the ELOQUENT-3 trial. In the ELOQUENT-2 trial, all reports of infusion reaction were Grade 3 or lower. In the ELOQUENT-2 trial, Grade 3 infusion reactions occurred in 1% of patients. The most common symptoms of an infusion reaction included fever, chills, and hypertension. Bradycardia and hypotension also developed during infusions.  



 In the ELOQUENT-2 trial, 5% of patients required interruption of the administration of EMPLICITI for a median of 25 minutes due to infusion reactions, and 1% of patients discontinued due to infusion reactions. Of the patients who experienced an infusion reaction, 70% (23/33) had them during the first dose.



  In the ELOQUENT-3 trial, the only infusion reaction symptom was chest discomfort (2%), which was Grade 1. All patients in the ELOQUENT-3 trial who experienced an infusion reaction had them during the first treatment cycle.  



 Administer premedication consisting of dexamethasone, antihistamines (H1 and H2 blockers) and acetaminophen prior to EMPLICITI infusion [ see     Dosage and Administration (2.3)    ].



 Interrupt EMPLICITI infusion for Grade 2 or higher infusion reactions and institute appropriate medical management [ see     Dosage and Administration (2.4)    ].



    5.2 Infections



   In the ELOQUENT-2 trial (N=635), infections were reported in 81% of patients in EMPLICITI combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (E-Ld) arm and 74% in lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Ld). In the ELOQUENT-3 trial (N=115), infections were reported in 65% of patients in both EMPLICITI combined with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (E-Pd) arm and in pomalidomide and dexamethasone (Pd) arm. In the ELOQUENT-2 trial, Grade 3 to 4 infections were noted in 28% and 24% of E-Ld- and Ld-treated patients and in the ELOQUENT-3 trial, 13% and 22% of E-Pd- and Pd-treated patients, respectively. Discontinuations due to infections occurred in 3.5% of E-Ld-treated and 4.1% of Ld-treated patients in the ELOQUENT-2 trial and 7% of E-Pd-treated and 5% of Pd-treated patients in the ELOQUENT-3 trial. Fatal infections were reported in 2.5% and 2.2% of E-Ld- and Ld-treated patients in the ELOQUENT-2 trial and 5% and 3.6% of E-Pd- and Pd-treated patients in the ELOQUENT-3 trial.  



  Opportunistic infections were reported in 22% of patients in the E-Ld arm and 13% of patients in the Ld arm in the ELOQUENT-2 trial and 10% of patients in the E-Pd arm and 9% of patients in the Pd arm in the ELOQUENT-3 trial. In the ELOQUENT-2 trial, fungal infections occurred in 10% of patients in the E-Ld arm and 5% of patients in the Ld arm. Herpes zoster was reported in 14% of patients treated with E-Ld and 7% of patients treated with Ld in the ELOQUENT-2 trial and 5% of patients treated with E-Pd and 1.8% of patients treated with Pd in the ELOQUENT-3 trial.  



 Monitor patients for development of infections and treat promptly.



    5.3 Second Primary Malignancies



   In the ELOQUENT-2 trial (N=635), invasive second primary malignancies (SPM) have been observed in 9% of patients treated with E-Ld and 6% of patients treated with Ld and in the ELOQUENT-3 trial (N=115) in 1.8% of patients treated with Pd and in none of the patients treated with E-Pd. In the ELOQUENT-2 trial, the rate of hematologic malignancies were the same between E-Ld and Ld treatment arms (1.6%). Solid tumors were reported in 3.5% and 2.2% of E-Ld- and Ld-treated patients, respectively. Skin cancer was reported in 4.4% and 2.8% of patients treated with E-Ld and Ld, respectively.  



 Monitor patients for the development of second primary malignancies.



    5.4 Hepatotoxicity



   In the ELOQUENT-2 trial (N=635), elevations in liver enzymes (aspartate transaminase/alanine transaminase [AST/ALT] greater than 3 times the upper limit, total bilirubin greater than 2 times the upper limit, and alkaline phosphatase less than 2 times the upper limit) consistent with hepatotoxicity were reported in 2.5% and 0.6% of E-Ld- and Ld-treated patients. Two patients experiencing hepatotoxicity were not able to continue treatment; however, 6 out of 8 patients had resolution and were able to continue treatment. Monitor liver enzymes periodically. Stop EMPLICITI upon Grade 3 or higher elevation of liver enzymes. After return to baseline values, continuation of treatment may be considered.  



    5.5 Interference with Determination of Complete Response



  EMPLICITI is a humanized IgG kappa monoclonal antibody that can be detected on both the serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and immunofixation (IFE) assays used for the clinical monitoring of endogenous M-protein [ see  Drug Interactions (7.2)    ]. This interference can impact the determination of complete response and possibly relapse from complete response in patients with IgG kappa myeloma protein.
