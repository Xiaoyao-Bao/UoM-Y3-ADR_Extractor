   To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Allergan at 1-800-678-1605 or the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.  

 

  6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

  The following information is based on clinical trial results from a multicenter, double-masked, randomized, vehicle-controlled, parallel study including 278 adult patients for four months of treatment.

 The most frequently reported adverse reactions were eye pruritus, conjunctival hyperemia, skin hyperpigmentation, ocular irritation, dry eye symptoms, and periorbital erythema. These reactions occurred in less than 4% of patients. Additional adverse reactions seen in clinical trials experience include foreign body sensation, hair growth abnormal, and iris hyperpigmentation.

 Additional adverse reactions reported with bimatoprost ophthalmic solution (  LUMIGAN      (r)    ) for the reduction of intraocular pressure include, ocular dryness, visual disturbance, ocular burning, eye pain, blepharitis, cataract, superficial punctate keratitis, eye discharge, tearing, photophobia, allergic conjunctivitis, asthenopia, conjunctival edema, iritis, infections (primarily colds and upper respiratory tract infections), headaches, and asthenia.

   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of  LATISSE      (r)    . Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions include: dry skin of the eyelid and/or periocular area, eye swelling, eyelid edema, hypersensitivity (local allergic reactions), lacrimation increased, madarosis and trichorrhexis (temporary loss of a few lashes to loss of sections of eyelashes, and temporary eyelash breakage, respectively), periorbital and lid changes associated with a deepening of the eyelid sulcus, rash (including macular and erythematous), skin discoloration (periorbital), and vision blurred.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">   5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

   EXCERPT:    *  Concurrent administration of LATISSE    (r)   and intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering prostaglandin analogs in ocular hypertensive patients may decrease the IOP-lowering effect. Patients using these products concomitantly should be closely monitored for changes to their IOP. (  5.1  ) 
 *  Pigmentation of the eyelids and iris may occur. Iris pigmentation is likely to be permanent. (  5.2  ,  5.3  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Effects on Intraocular Pressure

  Bimatoprost ophthalmic solution ( LUMIGAN     (r)    ) lowers intraocular pressure (IOP) when instilled directly to the eye in patients with elevated IOP. In clinical trials, in patients with or without elevated IOP, LATISSE     (r)    lowered IOP, however, the magnitude of the reduction was not cause for clinical concern.

 In ocular hypertension studies with LUMIGAN     (r)    , it has been shown that exposure of the eye to more than one dose of bimatoprost daily may decrease the intraocular pressure lowering effect. In patients using LUMIGAN     (r)    or other prostaglandin analogs for the treatment of elevated intraocular pressure, the concomitant use of LATISSE     (r)    may interfere with the desired reduction in IOP. Patients using prostaglandin analogs including LUMIGAN    (r)  for IOP reduction should only use LATISSE     (r)    after consulting with their physician and should be monitored for changes to their intraocular pressure [see Patient Counseling Information (  17  )]  .

    5.2 Iris Pigmentation

  Increased iris pigmentation has occurred when bimatoprost solution was administered. Patients should be advised about the potential for increased brown iris pigmentation which is likely to be permanent [see Adverse Reactions (  6.2  ) and Patient Counseling Information (  17  )]  .

 The pigmentation change is due to increased melanin content in the melanocytes rather than to an increase in the number of melanocytes. The long term effects of increased pigmentation are not known. Iris color changes seen with administration of bimatoprost ophthalmic solution may not be noticeable for several months to years. Typically, the brown pigmentation around the pupil spreads concentrically towards the periphery of the iris and the entire iris or parts of the iris become more brownish. Neither nevi nor freckles of the iris appear to be affected by treatment. Treatment with LATISSE     (r)    solution can be continued in patients who develop noticeably increased iris pigmentation.

    5.3 Lid Pigmentation

  Bimatoprost has been reported to cause pigment changes (darkening) to periorbital pigmented tissues and eyelashes. The pigmentation is expected to increase as long as bimatoprost is administered, but has been reported to be reversible upon discontinuation of bimatoprost in most patients [see Patient Counseling Information (  17  )]  .

    5.4 Hair Growth Outside the Treatment Area

  There is the potential for hair growth to occur in areas where LATISSE     (r)    solution comes in repeated contact with the skin surface. It is important to apply LATISSE     (r)    only to the skin of the upper eyelid margin at the base of the eyelashes using the accompanying sterile applicators, and to carefully blot any excess LATISSE     (r)    from the eyelid margin to avoid it running onto the cheek or other skin areas [see Patient Counseling Information (  17  )]  .

    5.5 Intraocular Inflammation

   LATISSE     (r)    solution should be used with caution in patients with active intraocular inflammation (e.g., uveitis) because the inflammation may be exacerbated.

    5.6 Macular Edema

  Macular edema, including cystoid macular edema, has been reported during treatment with bimatoprost ophthalmic solution ( LUMIGAN     (r)    ) for elevated IOP. LATISSE     (r)    should be used with caution in aphakic patients, in pseudophakic patients with a torn posterior lens capsule, or in patients with known risk factors for macular edema.

    5.7 Contamination of LATISSE  (r)  or Applicators

  The LATISSE     (r)    bottle must be kept intact during use. It is important to use LATISSE     (r)    solution as instructed, by placing one drop on the single-use-per-eye applicator. The bottle tip should not be allowed to contact any other surface since it could become contaminated. The accompanying sterile applicators should only be used on one eye and then discarded since reuse of applicators increases the potential for contamination and infections. There have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of multiple-dose containers of topical ophthalmic products [see Patient Counseling Information (  17  )]  .

    5.8 Use with Contact Lenses

   LATISSE     (r)    contains benzalkonium chloride, which may be absorbed by and cause discoloration of soft contact lenses. Contact lenses should be removed prior to application of solution and may be reinserted 15 minutes following its administration [see Patient Counseling Information (  17  )]  .
