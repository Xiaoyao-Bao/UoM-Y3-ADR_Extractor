    6.1 Clinical Trials Experience  

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 During clinical trials, 1210 subjects were exposed to MIRVASO topical gel. A total of 833 subjects were treated for persistent (nontransient) erythema associated with rosacea, and 330 of those were treated once daily for 29 days in vehicle-controlled trials.



 Adverse reactions that occurred in at least 1% of subjects treated with MIRVASO topical gel once daily for 29 days and for which the rate for MIRVASO topical gel exceeded the rate for vehicle are presented in Table 1.

          Open-label, Long-term Study    An open-label study of MIRVASO topical gel when applied once daily for up to one year was conducted in subjects with persistent (nontransient) facial erythema of rosacea. Subjects were allowed to use other rosacea therapies. A total of 276 subjects applied MIRVASO topical gel for at least one year. The most common adverse events (  &gt;  4% of subjects) for the entire study were flushing (10%), erythema (8%), rosacea (5%), nasopharyngitis (5%), skin burning sensation (4%), increased intraocular pressure (4%), and headache (4%).
 

     Allergic contact dermatitis    Allergic contact dermatitis to MIRVASO topical gel was reported in approximately 1% of subjects across the clinical development program. Two subjects underwent patch testing with individual product ingredients. One subject was found to be sensitive to brimonidine tartrate, and one subject was sensitive to phenoxyethanol (a preservative).



     6.2 Postmarketing Experience  

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of MIRVASO topical gel. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Cardiovascular disorders:  bradycardia, hypotension (including orthostatic hypotension)



   Immune system disorders:  angioedema, hypersensitivity, lip swelling, swollen tongue, throat tightness, urticaria



   Nervous systemic disorders:  dizziness



   Skin and subcutaneous disorders:  pallor

     EXCERPT:    *  Potentiation of Vascular Insufficiency (  5.1  ) 
 *  Severe Cardiovascular Disease (  5.2  ) 
 *  Serious Adverse Reactions Following Ingestion of MIRVASO topical gel (  5.3  )

}} 



    5.1 Potentiation of Vascular Insufficiency  



  MIRVASO topical gel should be used with caution in patients with depression, cerebral or coronary insufficiency, Raynaud's phenomenon, orthostatic hypotension, thrombangiitis obliterans, scleroderma, or Sjogren's syndrome.



     5.2 Severe Cardiovascular Disease  



  Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists can lower blood pressure. MIRVASO topical gel should be used with caution in patients with severe or unstable or uncontrolled cardiovascular disease.



     5.3 Serious Adverse Reactions Following Ingestion of MIRVASO topical gel  



  Two young children of a subject in a clinical trial experienced serious adverse reactions following accidental ingestion of MIRVASO topical gel. Adverse reactions experienced by one or both children included lethargy, respiratory distress with apneic episodes (requiring intubation), sinus bradycardia, confusion, psychomotor hyperactivity, and diaphoresis. Both children were hospitalized overnight and discharged the following day without sequelae.



 Keep MIRVASO topical gel out of the reach of children.



     5.4 Systemic Adverse Reactions of Alpha-2 Adrenergic Agonists  



  Postmarketing cases of bradycardia, hypotension (including orthostatic hypotension) and dizziness have been reported. Some cases required hospitalization. Some cases involved application of MIRVASO topical gel in unapproved dosing regimens and for unapproved indications, including the application of MIRVASO topical gel following laser procedures.



 Avoid applying MIRVASO topical gel to irritated skin or open wounds.



     5.5 Local Vasomotor Adverse Reactions  



    Erythema    



 Some subjects in the clinical trials discontinued use of MIRVASO topical gel because of erythema. Some subjects in the clinical trials reported a rebound phenomenon, where erythema was reported to return worse compared to the severity at baseline.



 Erythema appeared to resolve after discontinuation of MIRVASO topical gel .[see   Adverse Reactions (  6.1    )].



 The treatment effect of MIRVASO topical gel may begin to diminish hours after application.



 From postmarketing reports, some patients have experienced erythema involving areas of the face that were previously not affected by erythema and in areas (e.g., neck and chest) outside of the treatment sites.



   Flushing    



 Some subjects in the clinical trials discontinued use of MIRVASO topical gel   because of flushing.



 Intermittent flushing occurred in some subjects treated with MIRVASO topical gel in the clinical trials. The onset of flushing relative to application of MIRVASO topical gel varied, ranging from approximately 30 minutes to several hours [ see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )  ]. Flushing appeared to resolve after discontinuation of MIRVASO topical gel.



 From postmarketing reports, some patients have experienced increased frequency of flushing and/or increased depth of



 erythema with the flushing. Additionally, some patients reported new onset of flushing.



   Pallor and Excessive Whitening    



 From postmarketing reports, some patients have experienced pallor or excessive whitening at or outside the application site following treatment with MIRVASO topical gel.



     5.6 Hypersensitivity  



  Allergic contact dermatitis was reported in the clinical trials for MIRVASO topical gel [ see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )  ].



 Events reported post marketing with the use of MIRVASO topical gel include angioedema, throat tightening, tongue swelling, and urticaria, [ see Adverse Reactions (  6.2  )  ]. Institute appropriate therapy and discontinue MIRVASO topical gel, if clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction occurs.
