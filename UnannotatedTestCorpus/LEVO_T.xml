  Adverse reactions associated with LEVO-T therapy are primarily those of hyperthyroidism due to therapeutic overdosage  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5)    ,    Overdosage (10)  ]  . They include the following:



 *   General: fatigue, increased appetite, weight loss, heat intolerance, fever, excessive sweating 
 *   Central nervous system: headache, hyperactivity, nervousness, anxiety, irritability, emotional lability, insomnia 
 *   Musculoskeletal: tremors, muscle weakness, muscle spasm 
 *   Cardiovascular: palpitations, tachycardia, arrhythmias, increased pulse and blood pressure, heart failure, angina, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest 
 *   Respiratory: dyspnea 
 *   Gastrointestinal: diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, elevations in liver function tests 
 *   Dermatologic: hair loss, flushing, rash 
 *   Endocrine: decreased bone mineral density 
 *   Reproductive: menstrual irregularities, impaired fertility 
    Seizures have been reported rarely with the institution of levothyroxine therapy.
 

   EXCERPT:   Adverse reactions associated with LEVO-T therapy are primarily those of hyperthyroidism due to therapeutic overdosage: arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, dyspnea, muscle spasm, headache, nervousness, irritability, insomnia, tremors, muscle weakness, increased appetite, weight loss, diarrhea, heat intolerance, menstrual irregularities, and skin rash.

    Adverse Reactions in Children  



 Pseudotumor cerebri and slipped capital femoral epiphysis have been reported in children receiving levothyroxine therapy. Overtreatment may result in craniosynostosis in infants and premature closure of the epiphyses in children with resultant compromised adult height.



     Hypersensitivity Reactions  



 Hypersensitivity reactions to inactive ingredients have occurred in patients treated with thyroid hormone products. These include urticaria, pruritus, skin rash, flushing, angioedema, various gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea), fever, arthralgia, serum sickness, and wheezing. Hypersensitivity to levothyroxine itself is not known to occur.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: NOT FOR TREATMENT OF OBESITY OR FOR WEIGHT LOSS

    WARNING: NOT FOR TREATMENT OF OBESITY OR FOR WEIGHT LOSS  

    Thyroid hormones, including Levo-T, either alone or with other therapeutic agents, should not be used for the treatment of obesity or for weight loss.  



   In euthyroid patients, doses within the range of daily hormonal requirements are ineffective for weight reduction.  



   Larger doses may produce serious or even life threatening manifestations of toxicity, particularly when given in association with sympathomimetic amines such as those used for their anorectic effects 

      [see 

       Adverse Reactions (6)  , 

       Drug Interactions (7.7)  , and 

       Overdosage (10)  ]

   EXCERPT:     WARNING: NOT FOR TREATMENT OF OBESITY OR FOR WEIGHT LOSS

     

See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning

      



 *  Thyroid hormones, including Levo-T should not be used for the treatment of obesity or for weight loss. 
 *  Doses beyond the range of daily hormonal requirements may produce serious or even life threatening manifestations of toxicity (6, 10).

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *   Cardiac adverse reactions in the elderly and in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease: Initiate LEVO-T at less than the full replacement dose because of the increased risk of cardiac adverse reactions, including atrial fibrillation. (  2.3  ,  5.1  ,  8.5  ) 
 *   Myxedema coma: Do not use oral thyroid hormone drug products to treat myxedema coma. (  5.2  ) 
 *   Acute adrenal crisis in patients with concomitant adrenal insufficiency: Treat with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiation of LEVO-T treatment. (  5.3  ) 
 *   Prevention of hyperthyroidism or incomplete treatment of hypothyroidism: Proper dose titration and careful monitoring is critical to prevent the persistence of hypothyroidism or the development of hyperthyroidism. (  5.4  ) 
 *   Worsening of diabetic control: Therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing thyroid hormone therapy. (  5.5  ) 
 *   Decreased bone mineral density associated with thyroid hormone over-replacement: Over-replacement can increase bone resorption and decrease bone mineral density. Give the lowest effective dose. (  5.6  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Cardiac Adverse Reactions in the Elderly and in Patients with Underlying Cardiovascular Disease



  Over-treatment with levothyroxine may cause an increase in heart rate, cardiac wall thickness, and cardiac contractility and may precipitate angina or arrhythmias, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease and in elderly patients. Initiate LEVO-T therapy in this population at lower doses than those recommended in younger individuals or in patients without cardiac disease [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ,  Use in Specific Populations (8.5)  ]  .



 Monitor for cardiac arrhythmias during surgical procedures in patients with coronary artery disease receiving suppressive LEVO-T therapy. Monitor patients receiving concomitant LEVO-T and sympathomimetic agents for signs and symptoms of coronary insufficiency.



 If cardiac symptoms develop or worsen, reduce the LEVO-T dose or withhold for one week and restart at a lower dose.



    5.2 Myxedema Coma



  Myxedema coma is a life-threatening emergency characterized by poor circulation and hypometabolism, and may result in unpredictable absorption of levothyroxine sodium from the gastrointestinal tract. Use of oral thyroid hormone drug products is not recommended to treat myxedema coma. Administer thyroid hormone products formulated for intravenous administration to treat myxedema coma.



    5.3 Acute Adrenal Crisis in Patients with Concomitant Adrenal Insufficiency



  Thyroid hormone increases metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids. Initiation of thyroid hormone therapy prior to initiating glucocorticoid therapy may precipitate an acute adrenal crisis in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Treat patients with adrenal insufficiency with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiating treatment with LEVO-T [see  Contraindications (4)  ].  



    5.4 Prevention of Hyperthyroidism or Incomplete Treatment of Hypothyroidism



  LEVO-T has a narrow therapeutic index. Over- or undertreatment with LEVO-T may have negative effects on growth and development, cardiovascular function, bone metabolism, reproductive function, cognitive function, emotional state, gastrointestinal function, and glucose and lipid metabolism. Titrate the dose of LEVO-T carefully and monitor response to titration to avoid these effects [see  Dosage and Administration (2.4)  ]  . Monitor for the presence of drug or food interactions when using LEVO-T and adjust the dose as necessary [see  Drug Interactions (7.9)  and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  .



    5.5 Worsening of Diabetic Control



  Addition of levothyroxine therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing LEVO-T [see  Drug Interactions (7.2)  ]  .



    5.6 Decreased Bone Mineral Density Associated with Thyroid Hormone Over-Replacement



  Increased bone resorption and decreased bone mineral density may occur as a result of levothyroxine over-replacement, particularly in post-menopausal women. The increased bone resorption may be associated with increased serum levels and urinary excretion of calcium and phosphorous, elevations in bone alkaline phosphatase, and suppressed serum parathyroid hormone levels. Administer the minimum dose of LEVO-T that achieves the desired clinical and biochemical response to mitigate this risk.
