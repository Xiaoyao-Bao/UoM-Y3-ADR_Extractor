    <Section id="S1" name="adverse reactions">    ADVERSE REACTIONS

  The most frequent adverse reaction to nondepolarizing blocking agents as a class consists of an extension of the drug's pharmacological action beyond the time period needed. This may vary from skeletal muscle weakness to profound and prolonged skeletal muscle paralysis resulting in respiration insufficiency or apnea.



 Inadequate reversal of the neuromuscular blockade is possible with NORCURON  (r)  (vecuronium bromide) for Injection as with all curariform drugs. These adverse reactions are managed by manual or mechanical ventilation until recovery is judged adequate. Little or no increase in intensity of blockade or duration of action with NORCURON  (r)  is noted from the use of thiobarbiturates, narcotic analgesics, nitrous oxide, or droperidol. See  OVERDOSAGE  for discussion of other drugs used in anesthetic practice which also cause respiratory depression.



 Prolonged to profound extension of paralysis and/or muscle weakness as well as muscle atrophy have been reported after long-term use to support mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit [see  PRECAUTIONS, Long-term Use in ICU  ]. The administration of NORCURON  (r)  has been associated with rare instances of hypersensitivity reactions (bronchospasm, hypotension and/or tachycardia, sometimes associated with acute urticaria or erythema); [see  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  ].



 There have been post-marketing reports of severe allergic reactions (anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions) with the use of neuromuscular blocking agents, including NORCURON  (r)  . These reactions, in some cases, have been life-threatening and fatal. Because these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency (see    WARNINGS    and    PRECAUTIONS    ).

   Anaphylaxis



  Since allergic cross-reactivity has been reported in this class, request information from your patients about previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents. In addition, inform your patients that severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including NORCURON  (r)  , have been reported.



    Renal Failure



  NORCURON  (r)  (vecuronium bromide) for Injection is well tolerated without clinically significant prolongation of neuromuscular blocking effect in patients with renal failure who have been optimally prepared for surgery by dialysis. Under emergency conditions in anephric patients, some prolongation of neuromuscular blockade may occur; therefore, if anephric patients cannot be prepared for non-elective surgery, a lower initial dose of NORCURON  (r)  should be considered.



    Altered Circulation Time



  Conditions associated with slower circulation time in cardiovascular disease, old age, edematous states resulting in increased volume of distribution may contribute to delay in onset time; therefore, dosage should not be increased.



    Hepatic Disease



  Experience in patients with cirrhosis or cholestasis has revealed prolonged recovery time in keeping with the role the liver plays in NORCURON  (r)  (vecuronium bromide) for Injection metabolism and excretion [see  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics  ]. Data currently available do not permit dosage recommendations in patients with impaired liver function.



    Long-term Use in ICU



  In the intensive care unit, long-term use of neuromuscular blocking drugs to facilitate mechanical ventilation may be associated with prolonged paralysis and/or skeletal muscle weakness, that may be first noted during attempts to wean such patients from the ventilator. Typically, such patients receive other drugs such as broad spectrum antibiotics, narcotics and/or steroids and may have electrolyte imbalance and diseases which lead to electrolyte imbalance, hypoxic episodes of varying duration, acid-base imbalance and extreme debilitation, any of which may enhance the actions of a neuromuscular blocking agent. Additionally, patients immobilized for extended periods frequently develop symptoms consistent with disuse muscle atrophy. The recovery picture may vary from regaining movement and strength in all muscles to initial recovery of movement of the facial and small muscles of the extremities then to the remaining muscles. In rare cases recovery may be over an extended period of time and may even, on occasion, involve rehabilitation. Therefore, when there is a need for long-term mechanical ventilation, the benefits-to-risk ratio of neuromuscular blockade must be considered.



 Continuous infusion or intermittent bolus dosing to support mechanical ventilation, has not been studied sufficiently to support dosage recommendations. IN THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT, APPROPRIATE MONITORING, WITH THE USE OF A PERIPHERAL NERVE STIMULATOR TO ASSESS THE DEGREE OF NEUROMUSCULAR BLOCKADE IS RECOMMENDED TO HELP PRECLUDE POSSIBLE PROLONGATION OF THE BLOCKADE. WHENEVER THE USE OF NORCURON  (r)  (VECURONIUM BROMIDE) FOR INJECTION OR ANY NEUROMUSCULAR BLOCKING AGENT IS CONTEMPLATED IN THE ICU, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT NEUROMUSCULAR TRANSMISSION BE MONITORED CONTINUOUSLY DURING ADMINISTRATION AND RECOVERY WITH THE HELP OF A NERVE STIMULATOR. ADDITIONAL DOSES OF NORCURON  (r)  OR ANY OTHER NEUROMUSCULAR BLOCKING AGENT SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN BEFORE THERE IS A DEFINITE RESPONSE TO T1OR TO THE FIRST TWITCH. IF NO RESPONSE IS ELICITED, INFUSION ADMINISTRATION SHOULD BE DISCONTINUED UNTIL A RESPONSE RETURNS.



    Severe Obesity or Neuromuscular Disease



  Patients with severe obesity or neuromuscular disease may pose airway and/or ventilatory problems requiring special care before, during and after the use of neuromuscular blocking agents such as NORCURON  (r)  (vecuronium bromide) for Injection.



    Malignant Hyperthermia



  Many drugs used in anesthetic practice are suspected of being capable of triggering a potentially fatal hypermetabolism of skeletal muscle known as malignant hyperthermia. There are insufficient data derived from screening in susceptible animals (swine) to establish whether or not NORCURON  (r)  (vecuronium bromide) for Injection is capable of triggering hyperthermia.



    CNS



  NORCURON  (r)  (vecuronium bromide) for Injection has no known effect on consciousness, the pain threshold, or cerebration. Administration must be accompanied by adequate anesthesia or sedation.



    Drug Interactions



  Prior administration of succinylcholine may enhance the neuromuscular blocking effect of NORCURON  (r)  (vecuronium bromide) for Injection and its duration of action. If succinylcholine is used before NORCURON  (r)  , the administration of NORCURON  (r)  should be delayed until the succinylcholine effect shows signs of wearing off. With succinylcholine as the intubating agent, initial doses of 0.04 to 0.06 mg/kg of NORCURON  (r)  may be administered to produce complete neuromuscular block with clinical duration of action of 25 to 30 minutes [see  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  ].



 The use of NORCURON  (r)  before succinylcholine, in order to attenuate some of the side effects of succinylcholine, has not been sufficiently studied.



 Other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (pancuronium, d-tubocurarine, metocurine, and gallamine) act in the same fashion as does NORCURON  (r)  ; therefore, these drugs and NORCURON  (r)  may manifest an additive effect when used together. There are insufficient data to support concomitant use of NORCURON  (r)  and other competitive muscle relaxants in the same patient.



    Inhalational Anesthetics



  Use of volatile inhalational anesthetics such as enflurane, isoflurane, and halothane with NORCURON  (r)  will enhance neuromuscular blockade. Potentiation is most prominent with use of enflurane and isoflurane. With the above agents the initial dose of NORCURON  (r)  may be the same as the balanced anesthesia unless the inhalational anesthetic has been administered for a sufficient time at a sufficient dose to have reached clinical equilibrium [see  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  ].



    Antibiotics



  Parenteral/intraperitoneal administration of high doses of certain antibiotics may intensify or produce neuromuscular block on their own. The following antibiotics have been associated with various degrees of paralysis: aminoglycosides (such as neomycin, streptomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, and dihydrostreptomycin); tetracyclines; bacitracin; polymyxin B; colistin; and sodium colistimethate. If these or other newly introduced antibiotics are used in conjunction with NORCURON  (r)  , unexpected prolongation of neuromuscular block should be considered a possibility.



    Thiopental



  Reconstituted NORCURON  (r)  , which has an acid pH, should not be mixed with alkaline solutions (e.g., barbiturate solutions such as thiopental) in the same syringe or administered simultaneously during intravenous infusion through the same needle or through the same intravenous line [see  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Compatibility  ].



    Other



  Experience concerning injection of quinidine during recovery from use of other muscle relaxants suggests that recurrent paralysis may occur. This possibility must also be considered for NORCURON  (r)  . NORCURON  (r)  -induced neuromuscular blockade has been counteracted by alkalosis and enhanced by acidosis in experimental animals (cat). Electrolyte imbalance and diseases which lead to electrolyte imbalance, such as adrenal cortical insufficiency, have been shown to alter neuromuscular blockade. Depending on the nature of the imbalance, either enhancement or inhibition may be expected. Magnesium salts, administered for the management of toxemia of pregnancy, may enhance the neuromuscular blockade.



    Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions



  None known.



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility



  Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic or mutagenic potential or impairment of fertility.



    Pregnancy



   Pregnancy Category C



  Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with NORCURON  (r)  (vecuronium bromide) for Injection. It is also not known whether NORCURON  (r)  can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. NORCURON  (r)  should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.



    Labor and Delivery



  The use of NORCURON  (r)  (vecuronium bromide) for Injection in patients undergoing cesarean section has been reported in the literature. Following tracheal intubation with succinylcholine, NORCURON  (r)  dosages of 0.04 mg/kg (n=11) and 0.06 to 0.08 mg/kg (n=20) were administered. The umbilical venous plasma concentrations were 11% of maternal concentrations at delivery and mean neonate APGAR scores at 5 minutes were &gt;=9 in both reports. The action of neuromuscular blocking agents may be enhanced by magnesium salts administered for the management of toxemia of pregnancy.



    Nursing Mothers



  It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when NORCURON  (r)  (vecuronium bromide) for Injection is administered to a nursing woman.



    Pediatric Use



  Infants under 1 year of age but older than 7 weeks, also tested under halothane anesthesia, are moderately more sensitive to NORCURON  (r)  (vecuronium bromide) for Injection on a mg/kg basis than adults and take about 1.5 times as long to recover. See  Use in Pediatrics  subsection of  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  for recommendations for use in pediatric patients 7 weeks to 16 years of age. The safety and effectiveness of NORCURON  (r)  in pediatric patients less than 7 weeks of age have not been established.



    Geriatric Use



  Clinical studies of NORCURON  (r)  (vecuronium bromide) for Injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. There are some reports in the peer reviewed literature of increased effect and longer duration of action of NORCURON  (r)  in the elderly compared to younger patients. However, other reports have found no significant differences between healthy elderly and younger adults. Advanced age or other conditions associated with slower circulation time, may be associated with a delay in onset time [see  PRECAUTIONS, Altered Circulation Time  ]. Nevertheless, recommended doses of NORCURON  (r)  should not be increased in these patients to reduce onset time, as higher doses produce a longer duration of action [see  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  ]. Dose selections for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Close monitoring of neuromuscular function is recommended.

    <Section id="S4" name="warnings">    WARNINGS



  NORCURON  (r)  (VECURONIUM BROMIDE) FOR INJECTION SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED IN CAREFULLY ADJUSTED DOSAGE BY OR UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF EXPERIENCED CLINICIANS WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH ITS ACTIONS AND THE POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS THAT MIGHT OCCUR FOLLOWING ITS USE. THE DRUG SHOULD NOT BE ADMINISTERED UNLESS FACILITIES FOR INTUBATION, ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATION, OXYGEN THERAPY, AND REVERSAL AGENTS ARE IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE. THE CLINICIAN MUST BE PREPARED TO ASSIST OR CONTROL RESPIRATION, TO REDUCE THE POSSIBILITY OF PROLONGED NEUROMUSCULAR BLOCKADE AND OTHER POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS THAT MIGHT OCCUR FOLLOWING LONG-TERM USE IN THE ICU. NORCURON  (r)  OR ANY OTHER NEUROMUSCULAR BLOCKING AGENT SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED IN CAREFULLY ADJUSTED DOSES BY OR UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF EXPERIENCED CLINICIANS WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH ITS ACTIONS AND WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH APPROPRIATE PERIPHERAL NERVE STIMULATOR MUSCLE MONITORING TECHNIQUES [see  PRECAUTIONS, Long-term Use in ICU  ].



    Anaphylaxis



  Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including NORCURON  (r)  , have been reported. These reactions have, in some cases, been life-threatening and fatal. Due to the potential severity of these reactions, the necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment, should be taken. Precautions should also be taken in those individuals who have had previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents, since cross-reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non-depolarizing, has been reported.



 In patients who are known to have myasthenia gravis or the myasthenic (Eaton-Lambert) syndrome, small doses of NORCURON  (r)  may have profound effects. In such patients, a peripheral nerve stimulator and use of a small test dose may be of value in monitoring the response to administration of muscle relaxants.
