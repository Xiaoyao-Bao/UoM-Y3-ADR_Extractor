  Enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets have been evaluated for safety in more than 1500 patients, including over 300 patients treated for one year or more. In clinical trials with enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets no adverse experiences peculiar to this combination drug have been observed. Adverse experiences that have occurred have been limited to those that have been previously reported with enalapril or hydrochlorothiazide.



 The most frequent clinical adverse experiences in controlled trials were: dizziness (8.6 percent), headache (5.5 percent), fatigue (3.9 percent) and cough (3.5 percent). Generally, adverse experiences were mild and transient in nature. Adverse experiences occurring in greater than two percent of patients treated with enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in controlled clinical trials are shown below.

   Digestive:      Vomiting, dyspepsia, constipation, flatulence, dry mouth



   Nervous/Psychiatric:  Insomnia, nervousness, paresthesia, somnolence, vertigo



   Skin:  Pruritus, rash



   Other:  Dyspnea, gout, back pain, arthralgia, diaphoresis, decreased libido, tinnitus, urinary tract infection



   Angioedema

  Angioedema has been reported in patients receiving enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, with an incidence higher in black than in non-black patients. Angioedema associated with laryngeal edema may be fatal. If angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis and/or larynx occurs, treatment with enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted immediately (see  WARNINGS  ).



   Hypotension

  In clinical trials, adverse effects relating to hypotension occurred as follows: hypotension (0.9 percent), orthostatic hypotension (1.5 percent), other orthostatic effects (2.3 percent). In addition syncope occurred in 1.3 percent of patients (see  WARNINGS  ).



   Cough

  (See  PRECAUTIONS: Cough  .)



   Clinical Laboratory Test Findings

      Serum Electrolytes    

  (See  PRECAUTIONS  .)



       Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen    

  In controlled clinical trials minor increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, reversible upon discontinuation of therapy, were observed in about 0.6 percent of patients with essential hypertension treated with enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. More marked increases have been reported in other enalapril experience. Increases are more likely to occur in patients with renal artery stenosis (see  PRECAUTIONS  ).



       Serum Uric Acid, Glucose, Magnesium, and Calcium    

  (See  PRECAUTIONS  .)



       Hemoglobin and Hematocrit    

  Small decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit (mean decreases of approximately 0.3 g percent and 1.0 vol percent, respectively) occur frequently in hypertensive patients treated with enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets but are rarely of clinical importance unless another cause of anemia coexists. In clinical trials, less than 0.1 percent of patients discontinued therapy due to anemia.



       Liver Function Tests    

  Rarely, elevations of liver enzymes and/or serum bilirubin have occurred (see  WARNINGS: Hepatic Failure  ).



 Other adverse reactions that have been reported with the individual components are listed below and, within each category, are in order of decreasing severity.



   Enalapril Maleate

  Enalapril has been evaluated for safety in more than 10,000 patients. In clinical trials adverse reactions which occurred with enalapril were also seen with enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. However, since enalapril has been marketed, the following adverse reactions have been reported:  Body as a Whole:  Anaphylactoid reactions (see  WARNINGS: Anaphylactoid Reactions During Membrane Exposure  );    Cardiovascular:    Cardiac arrest; myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident, possibly secondary to excessive hypotension in high risk patients (see  WARNINGS: Hypotension  ); pulmonary embolism and infarction; pulmonary edema; rhythm disturbances including atrial tachycardia and bradycardia; atrial fibrillation; hypotension; angina pectoris, Raynaud's phenomenon;  Digestive:  Ileus, pancreatitis, hepatic failure, hepatitis (hepatocellular [proven on rechallenge] or cholestatic jaundice) (see  WARNINGS: Hepatic Failure  ), melena, anorexia, glossitis, stomatitis, dry mouth;  Hematologic:  Rare cases of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and bone marrow depression. Hemolytic anemia, including cases of hemolysis in patients with G6PD deficiency, has been reported; a causal relationship to enalapril cannot be excluded.  Nervous System/Psychiatric:  Depression, confusion, ataxia, peripheral neuropathy (e.g., paresthesia, dysesthesia), dream abnormality;  Urogenital:  Renal failure, oliguria, renal dysfunction, (see  PRECAUTIONS  and  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  ), flank pain, gynecomastia;  Respiratory:  Pulmonary infiltrates, eosinophilic pneumonitis, bronchospasm, pneumonia, bronchitis, rhinorrhea, sore throat and hoarseness, asthma, upper respiratory infection;  Skin:  Exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, herpes zoster, erythema multiforme, urticaria, pemphigus, alopecia, flushing, photosensitivity;  Special Senses:  Blurred vision, taste alteration, anosmia, conjunctivitis, dry eyes, tearing.



     Miscellaneous:    A symptom complex has been reported which may include some or all of the following: a positive ANA, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, arthralgia/arthritis, myalgia/myositis, fever, serositis, vasculitis, leukocytosis, eosinophilia, photosensitivity, rash and other dermatologic manifestations.



   Hydrochlorothiazide

    Body as a Whole:  Weakness;  Digestive:  Pancreatitis, jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice), sialadenitis, cramping, gastric irritation, anorexia;  Hematologic:  Aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia;  Hypersensitivity:  Purpura, photosensitivity, urticaria, necrotizing angiitis (vasculitis and cutaneous vasculitis), fever, respiratory distress including pneumonitis and pulmonary edema, anaphylactic reactions;  Musculoskeletal:  Muscle spasm;  Nervous System/Psychiatric:  Restlessness;  Renal:  Renal failure, renal dysfunction, interstitial nephritis (see  WARNINGS  );  Skin:  Erythema multiforme including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis including toxic epidermal necrolysis, alopecia;  Special Senses:  Transient blurred vision, xanthopsia.

    <Section id="S3" name="precautions">    PRECAUTIONS



   General



     Enalapril Maleate    



   Aortic Stenosis/Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy



  As with all vasodilators, enalapril should be given with caution to patients with obstruction in the outflow tract of the left ventricle.



    Impaired Renal Function



  As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe congestive heart failure whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, including enalapril, may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and rarely with acute renal failure and/or death (see  PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions  ).



 In clinical studies in hypertensive patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine were observed in 20 percent of patients. These increases were almost always reversible upon discontinuation of enalapril and/or diuretic therapy. In such patients renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of therapy.



 Some patients with hypertension or heart failure with no apparent pre-existing renal vascular disease have developed increases in blood urea and serum creatinine, usually minor and transient, especially when enalapril has been given concomitantly with a diuretic. This is more likely to occur in patients with pre-existing renal impairment. Dosage reduction of enalapril and/or discontinuation of the diuretic may be required.



  Evaluation of the hypertensive patient should always include assessment of renal function.  



    Hyperkalemia



  Elevated serum potassium (greater than 5.7 mEq/L) was observed in approximately one percent of hypertensive patients in clinical trials treated with enalapril alone. In most cases these were isolated values which resolved despite continued therapy, although hyperkalemia was a cause of discontinuation of therapy in 0.28 percent of hypertensive patients. Hyperkalemia was less frequent (approximately 0.1 percent) in patients treated with enalapril plus hydrochlorothiazide. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements and/or potassium-containing salt substitutes, which should be used cautiously, if at all, with enalapril (see  Drug Interactions  ).



    Cough



  Presumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, always resolving after discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough.



    Surgery/Anesthesia



  In patients undergoing major surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, enalapril may block angiotensin II formation secondary to compensatory renin release. If hypotension occurs and is considered to be due to this mechanism, it can be corrected by volume expansion.



      Hydrochlorothiazide    



  Periodic determination of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals. All patients receiving thiazide therapy should be observed for clinical signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance: hyponatremia, hypochloremic alkalosis, and hypokalemia. Serum and urine electrolyte determinations are particularly important when the patient is vomiting excessively or receiving parenteral fluids. Warning signs or symptoms of fluid and electrolyte imbalance, irrespective of cause, include dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, confusion, seizures, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting.



 Hypokalemia may develop, especially with brisk diuresis, when severe cirrhosis is present, or after prolonged therapy. Interference with adequate oral electrolyte intake will also contribute to hypokalemia. Hypokalemia may cause cardiac arrhythmia and may also sensitize or exaggerate the response of the heart to the toxic effects of digitalis (e.g., increased ventricular irritability). Because enalapril reduces the production of aldosterone, concomitant therapy with enalapril attenuates the diuretic-induced potassium loss (see  Drug Interactions: Agents Increasing Serum Potassium  ).



 Although any chloride deficit is generally mild and usually does not require specific treatment except under extraordinary circumstances (as in liver disease or renal disease), chloride replacement may be required in the treatment of metabolic alkalosis.



 Dilutional hyponatremia may occur in edematous patients in hot weather; appropriate therapy is water restriction, rather than administration of salt except in rare instances when the hyponatremia is life-threatening. In actual salt depletion, appropriate replacement is the therapy of choice.



 Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy.



 In diabetic patients dosage adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents may be required. Hyperglycemia may occur with thiazide diuretics. Thus latent diabetes mellitus may become manifest during thiazide therapy.



 The antihypertensive effects of the drug may be enhanced in the post-sympathectomy patient.



 If progressive renal impairment becomes evident consider withholding or discontinuing diuretic therapy.



 Thiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium; this may result in hypomagnesemia.



 Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion. Thiazides may cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function.



 Increases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels may be associated with thiazide diuretic therapy.



    Information for Patients



     Angioedema    



  Angioedema, including laryngeal edema, may occur at any time during treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, including enalapril. Patients should be so advised and told to report immediately any signs or symptoms suggesting angioedema (swelling of face, extremities, eyes, lips, tongue, difficulty in swallowing or breathing) and to take no more drug until they have consulted with the prescribing physician.



      Hypotension    



  Patients should be cautioned to report lightheadedness especially during the first few days of therapy. If actual syncope occurs, the patients should be told to discontinue the drug until they have consulted with the prescribing physician.



 All patients should be cautioned that excessive perspiration and dehydration may lead to an excessive fall in blood pressure because of reduction in fluid volume. Other causes of volume depletion such as vomiting or diarrhea may also lead to a fall in blood pressure; patients should be advised to consult with the physician.



      Hyperkalemia    



  Patients should be told not to use salt substitutes containing potassium without consulting their physician.



      Neutropenia    



  Patients should be told to report promptly any indication of infection (e.g., sore throat, fever) which may be a sign of neutropenia.



      Pregnancy    



  Female patients of childbearing age should be told about the consequences of exposure to enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets during pregnancy. Discuss treatment options with women planning to become pregnant. Patients should be asked to report pregnancies to their physicians as soon as possible.



 NOTE: As with many other drugs, certain advice to patients being treated with enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets is warranted. This information is intended to aid in the safe and effective use of this medication. It is not a disclosure of all possible adverse or intended effects.



    Drug Interactions



     Neprilysin Inhibitors    



  Patients taking concomitant neprilysin inhibitors may be at increased risk for angioedema (see WARNINGS).



      Enalapril Maleate    



   Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS)



  Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes in patients on enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and other agents that affect the RAS.



 Do not coadminister aliskiren with enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with renal impairment (GFR &lt; 60 mL/min).



    Hypotension - Patients on Diuretic Therapy



  Patients on diuretics and especially those in whom diuretic therapy was recently instituted, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with enalapril. The possibility of hypotensive effects with enalapril can be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with enalapril. If it is necessary to continue the diuretic, provide medical supervision for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for at least an additional hour (see  WARNINGS  and  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  ).



    Agents Causing Renin Release



  The antihypertensive effect of enalapril is augmented by antihypertensive agents that cause renin release (e.g., diuretics).



    Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Agents Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors)



  In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including enalapril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving enalapril and NSAID therapy.



 In a clinical pharmacology study, indomethacin or sulindac was administered to hypertensive patients receiving enalapril maleate. In this study there was no evidence of a blunting of the antihypertensive action of enalapril maleate. However, reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors.



    Other Cardiovascular Agents



  Enalapril has been used concomitantly with beta adrenergic-blocking agents, methyldopa, nitrates, calcium-blocking agents, hydralazine and prazosin without evidence of clinically significant adverse interactions.



    Agents Increasing Serum Potassium



  Enalapril attenuates diuretic-induced potassium loss. Potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g., spironolactone, triamterene, or amiloride), potassium supplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes may lead to significant increases in serum potassium. Therefore, if concomitant use of these agents is indicated because of demonstrated hypokalemia they should be used with caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium.



    Lithium



  Lithium toxicity has been reported in patients receiving lithium concomitantly with drugs which cause elimination of sodium, including ACE inhibitors. A few cases of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving concomitant enalapril and lithium and were reversible upon discontinuation of both drugs. It is recommended that serum lithium levels be monitored frequently if enalapril is administered concomitantly with lithium.



    Gold



  Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy including enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets.



    mTOR (Mammalian Target of Rapamycin) Inhibitors



  Patients receiving coadministration of ACE inhibitor or mTOR inhibitor (e.g., temsirolimus, sirolimus, everolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema (see  WARNINGS  ).



      Hydrochlorothiazide    



  When administered concurrently the following drugs may interact with thiazide diuretics:



    Alcohol, Barbiturates, or Narcotics



  Potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur.



    Anti-diabetic Drugs (Oral Agents and Insulin)



  Dosage adjustment of the anti-diabetic drug may be required.



    Other Anti-hypertensive Drugs



  Additive effect or potentiation.



    Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resins



  Absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85 and 43 percent, respectively.



    Corticosteroids, ACTH



  Intensified electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalemia.



    Pressor Amines (e.g., Norepinephrine)



  Possible decreased response to pressor amines but not sufficient to preclude their use.



    Skeletal Muscle Relaxants, Nondepolarizing (e.g., Tubocurarine)



  Possible increased responsiveness to the muscle relaxant.



    Lithium



  Should not generally be given with diuretics. Diuretic agents reduce the renal clearance of lithium and add a high risk of lithium toxicity. Refer to the package insert for lithium preparations before use of such preparations with enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets.



    Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs



  In some patients, the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing and thiazide diuretics. Therefore, when enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained.



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility



  Enalapril in combination with hydrochlorothiazide was not mutagenic in the Ames microbial mutagen test with or without metabolic activation. Enalapril-hydrochlorothiazide did not produce DNA single strand breaks in an in vitro  alkaline elution assay in rat hepatocytes or chromosomal aberrations in an in vivo  mouse bone marrow assay.



      Enalapril Maleate    



  There was no evidence of a tumorigenic effect when enalapril was administered for 106 weeks to male and female rats at doses up to 90 mg/kg/day or for 94 weeks to male and female mice at doses up to 90 and 180 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are 26 times (in rats and female mice) and 13 times (in male mice) the maximum recommended human daily dose (MRHDD) when compared on a body surface area basis.



 Neither enalapril maleate nor the active diacid was mutagenic in the Ames microbial mutagen test with or without metabolic activation. Enalapril was also negative in the following genotoxicity studies: rec-assay, reverse mutation assay with E. coli  , sister chromatid exchange with cultured mammalian cells, and the micronucleus test with mice, as well as in an in vivo  cytogenic study using mouse bone marrow.



 There were no adverse effects on reproductive performance of male and female rats treated with up to 90 mg/kg/day of enalapril (26 times the MRHDD when compared on a body surface area basis).



      Hydrochlorothiazide    



  Two year feeding studies in mice and rats conducted under the auspices of the National Toxicology Program (NTP) uncovered no evidence of a carcinogenic potential of hydrochlorothiazide in female mice at doses up to approximately 600 mg/kg/day (53 times the MRHDD when compared on a body surface area basis) or in male and female rats at doses up to approximately 100 mg/kg/day (18 times the MRHDD when compared on a body surface area basis). The NTP, however, found equivocal evidence for hepatocarcinogenicity in male mice.



 Hydrochlorothiazide was not genotoxic in vitro  in the Ames mutagenicity assay of Salmonella typhimurium  strains TA 98, TA 100, TA 1535, TA 1537, and TA 1538 and in the Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) test for chromosomal aberrations, or in vivo  in assays using mouse germinal cell chromosomes, Chinese hamster bone marrow chromosomes, and the Drosophila  sex-linked recessive lethal trait gene. Positive test results were obtained only in the in vitro  CHO Sister Chromatid Exchange (clastogenicity) and in the Mouse Lymphoma Cell (mutagenicity) assays, using concentrations of hydrochlorothiazide from 43 to 1300 mcg/mL, and in the Aspergillus nidulans  non-disjunction assay at an unspecified concentration.



 Hydrochlorothiazide had no adverse effects on the fertility of mice and rats of either sex in studies wherein these species were exposed, via their diet, to doses of up to 100 and 4 mg/kg, respectively, prior to mating and throughout gestation. In mice and rats these doses are 9 times and 0.7 times, respectively, the MRHDD when compared on a body surface area basis.



    Pregnancy



     Nursing Mothers    



  Enalapril, enalaprilat, and hydrochlorothiazide have been detected in human breast milk. Because of the potential for serious reactions in nursing infants from either drug, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.



    Pediatric Use



     Neonates with a History of In Utero Exposure to Enalapril and Hydrochlorothiazide    



  If oliguria or hypotension occurs, direct attention toward support of blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal function. Enalapril, which crosses the placenta, has been removed from neonatal circulation by peritoneal dialysis with some clinical benefit, and theoretically may be removed by exchange transfusion, although there is no experience with the latter procedure.



 Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.



    Geriatric Use



  Clinical studies of enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.



 This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection. Evaluation of the hypertensive patient should always include assessment of renal function (see  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  ).

    <Section id="S4" name="warnings">    WARNINGS



   General



     Enalapril Maleate    



   Hypotension



  Excessive hypotension was rarely seen in uncomplicated hypertensive patients but is a possible consequence of enalapril use in severely salt/volume depleted persons such as those treated vigorously with diuretics or patients on dialysis.



 Syncope has been reported in 1.3 percent of patients receiving enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. In patients receiving enalapril alone, the incidence of syncope is 0.5 percent. The overall incidence of syncope may be reduced by proper titration of the individual components (see  PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions  ,  ADVERSE REACTIONS  and  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  ).



 In patients with severe congestive heart failure, with or without associated renal insufficiency, excessive hypotension has been observed and may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia, and rarely with acute renal failure and/or death. Because of the potential fall in blood pressure in these patients, therapy should be started under very close medical supervision. Such patients should be followed closely for the first two weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of enalapril and/or diuretic is increased. Similar considerations may apply to patients with ischemic heart or cerebrovascular disease, in whom an excessive fall in blood pressure could result in a myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident.



 If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, receive an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further doses, which usually can be given without difficulty once the blood pressure has increased after volume expansion.



    Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions



  Presumably because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors affect the metabolism of eicosanoids and polypeptides, including endogenous bradykinin, patients receiving ACE inhibitors (including enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets) may be subject to a variety of adverse reactions, some of them serious.



    Head and Neck Angioedema



  Angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis and/or larynx has been reported in patients treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, including enalapril. This may occur at any time during treatment. In such cases enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and monitoring should be provided until complete and sustained resolution of signs and symptoms has occurred. In instances where swelling has been confined to the face and lips the condition has generally resolved without treatment, although antihistamines have been useful in relieving symptoms. Angioedema associated with laryngeal edema may be fatal. Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx, likely to cause airway obstruction, appropriate therapy, e.g., subcutaneous epinephrine solution 1:1000 (0.3 mL to 0.5 mL) and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway, should be promptly provided  (see  ADVERSE REACTIONS  ).



 Patients receiving coadministration of ACE inhibitor and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor (e.g., temsirolimus, sirolimus, everolimus) therapy or a neprilysin inhibitor may be at increased risk for angioedema (see  PRECAUTIONS  ).



    Intestinal Angioedema



  Intestinal angioedema has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. These patients presented with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vomiting); in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C-1 esterase levels were normal. The angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angioedema should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain.



 Patients with a history of angioedema unrelated to ACE inhibitor therapy may be at increased risk of angioedema while receiving an ACE inhibitor (see also  INDICATIONS AND USAGE  and  CONTRAINDICATIONS  ).



    Anaphylactoid Reactions During Desensitization



  Two patients undergoing desensitizing treatment with hymenoptera venom while receiving ACE inhibitors sustained life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions. In the same patients, these reactions were avoided when ACE inhibitors were temporarily withheld, but they reappeared upon inadvertent rechallenge.



    Anaphylactoid Reactions During Membrane Exposure



  Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in patients dialyzed with high-flux membranes and treated concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor. Anaphylactoid reactions have also been reported in patients undergoing low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate absorption.



    Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis



  Another angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has been shown to cause agranulocytosis and bone marrow depression, rarely in uncomplicated patients but more frequently in patients with renal impairment especially if they also have a collagen vascular disease. Available data from clinical trials of enalapril are insufficient to show that enalapril does not cause agranulocytosis at similar rates. Marketing experience has revealed cases of neutropenia or agranulocytosis in which a causal relationship to enalapril cannot be excluded. Periodic monitoring of white blood cell counts in patients with collagen vascular disease and renal disease should be considered.



    Hepatic Failure



  Rarely, ACE inhibitors have been associated with a syndrome that starts with cholestatic jaundice and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis, and (sometimes) death. The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood. Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical follow-up.



      Hydrochlorothiazide    



  Thiazides should be used with caution in severe renal disease. In patients with renal disease, thiazides may precipitate azotemia. Cumulative effects of the drug may develop in patients with impaired renal function.



 Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma.



 Sensitivity reactions may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma.



 The possibility of exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported.



 Lithium generally should not be given with thiazides (see  PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions: Enalapril Maleate  and  Hydrochlorothiazide  ).



    Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle-Closure Glaucoma



  Hydrochlorothiazide, a sulfonamide, can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in acute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue hydrochlorothiazide as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy.



    Fetal Toxicity



     Enalapril Maleate    



  Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets as soon as possible. These adverse outcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. Appropriate management of maternal hypertension during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus.



 In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. If oligohydramnios is observed, discontinue enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. Closely observe infants with histories of in utero  exposure to enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia (see   PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use  ).



 No teratogenic effects of enalapril were seen in studies of pregnant rats and rabbits. On a body surface area basis, the doses used were 57 times and 12 times, respectively, the MRHDD.



      Enalapril-Hydrochlorothiazide    



  There was no teratogenicity in mice given up to 30 mg/kg/day or in rats given up to 90 mg/kg/day of enalapril in combination with 10 mg/kg/day of hydrochlorothiazide. These doses of enalapril are 4.3 and 26 times (mice and rats, respectively) the maximum recommended human daily dose (MRHDD) when compared on a body surface area basis (mg/m  2  ); the dose of hydrochlorothiazide is 0.8 times (in mice) and 1.6 times (in rats) the MRHDD. At these doses, fetotoxicity expressed as a decrease in average fetal weight occurred in both species. No fetotoxicity occurred at lower doses; 30/10 mg/kg/day of enalapril-hydrochlorothiazide in rats and 10/10 mg/kg/day of enalapril-hydrochlorothiazide in mice.



 When used in pregnancy during the second and third trimesters, ACE inhibitors can cause injury and even death to the developing fetus. When pregnancy is detected, enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be discontinued as soon as possible (see  WARNINGS: Fetal Toxicity  ).



      Hydrochlorothiazide    



  Studies in which hydrochlorothiazide was orally administered to pregnant mice and rats during their respective periods of major organogenesis at doses up to 3000 and 1000 mg/kg/day, respectively, provided no evidence of harm to the fetus. These doses are more than 150 times the MRHDD on a body surface area basis. Thiazides cross the placental barrier and appear in cord blood. There is a risk of fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia and possibly other adverse reactions that have occurred in adults.
