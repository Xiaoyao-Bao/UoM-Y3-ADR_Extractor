  EXCERPT:   The most common adverse reactions are burning/stinging/tingling (29%), pruritus (11%), scaling/dry skin/xerosis (8%) and erythema/irritation (4%).  (6)  



   To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Bayer HealthCare at 1-866-463-3634 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or    www.fda.gov/medwatch  .



 

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 In two vehicle-controlled and one active-controlled U.S. clinical trials, treatment safety was monitored in 788 subjects who used twice-daily FINACEA Gel for 12 weeks (N=333) or 15 weeks (N=124), or the gel vehicle (N=331) for 12 weeks. In all three trials, the most common treatment-related adverse events were: burning/stinging/tingling (29%), pruritus (11%), scaling/dry skin/xerosis (8%) and erythema/irritation (4%). In the active-controlled trial, overall adverse reactions (including burning, stinging/tingling, dryness/tightness/scaling, itching, and erythema/irritation/redness) were 19.4% (24/124) for FINACEA Gel compared to 7.1% (9/127) for the active comparator gel at 15 weeks.

             In patients using azelaic acid formulations, the following adverse events have been reported: worsening of asthma, vitiligo, depigmentation, small depigmented spots, hypertrichosis, reddening (signs of keratosis pilaris) and exacerbation of recurrent herpes labialis.
 

       Local Tolerability Studies    

  FINACEA Gel and its vehicle caused irritant reactions at the application site in human dermal safety studies. FINACEA Gel caused significantly more irritation than its vehicle in a cumulative irritation study. Some improvement in irritation was demonstrated over the course of the clinical trials, but this improvement might be attributed to subject dropouts. No phototoxicity or photoallergenicity were reported in human dermal safety studies.



   6.2 Post-Marketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified post approval of FINACEA Gel. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure:



 Eyes: iridocyclitis upon accidental exposure of the eyes to FINACEA Gel



 Hypersensitivity: angioedema, eye swelling, facial swelling, urticaria.



 Respiratory: worsening of asthma, dyspnea, wheezing,

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *     Hypersensitivity : In case of known hypersensitivity to any component of the gel, avoid the use of FINACEA Gel. If hypersensitivity develops during treatment, discontinue FINACEA Gel and institute appropriate therapy. (   5.1   ) 
 *     Skin Reactions: Skin irritation (i.e. pruritus, burning or stinging) may occur, usually during the first few weeks of treatment with FINACEA    Gel. If sensitivity or severe irritation develops and persists, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate therapy. (   5.2   ) 
 *     Hypopigmentation: Isolated cases of hypopigmentation occurred after azelaic acid use. Monitor patients with dark complexion for early signs of hypopigmentation (   5.2   ) 
 *     Eye and Mucous Membrane Irritation: FINACEA    Gel has been reported to cause irritation of the eyes. Therefore, avoid contact with the eyes and mucous membranes. (   5.3   ) 
 *     Exacerbation of A sthma: Consult a physician if asthma is exacerbated with FINACEA Gel use. (  5.4  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Hypersensitivity



  Hypersensitivity reactions, including cases of angioedema, eye swelling, facial swelling, dyspnea, urticaria, and adverse skin reactions, have been reported during post marketing surveillance.



 Avoid the use of FINACEA Gel in patients with known hypersensitivity to any component of the gel. If hypersensitivity develops during treatment, discontinue FINACEA Gel and institute appropriate therapy.



    5.2 Skin Reactions



  Skin irritation (i.e. pruritus, burning or stinging) may occur during use of FINACEA Gel, usually during the first few weeks of treatment. If sensitivity or severe irritation develops and persists, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate therapy.



 There have been isolated reports of hypopigmentation after use of azelaic acid. Since azelaic acid has not been well studied in patients with dark complexion, monitor these patients for early signs of hypopigmentation.



    5.3 Eye and Mucous Membranes Irritation



  Avoid contact with the eyes, mouth and other mucous membranes. If FINACEA Gel does come in contact with the eyes, wash the eyes with large amounts of water and consult a physician if eye irritation persists [see Adverse Reactions (  6.2  )]  .



    5.4 Exacerbation of Asthma



  Worsening of asthma has been reported in patients using azelaic acid formulations including FINACEA Gel. Consult a physician if asthma is exacerbated with use of FINACEA Gel.
