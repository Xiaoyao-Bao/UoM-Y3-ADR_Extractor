    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: RISK OF SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR AND GASTROINTESTINAL EVENTS

  WARNING: RISK OF SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR AND GASTROINTESTINAL EVENTS

  Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events

    *  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) cause an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke, which can be fatal. This risk may occur early in treatment and may increase with duration of use (see WARNINGS). 
 *  PONSTEL(r) is contraindicated in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS). 
      Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation
     *  NSAIDs cause an increased risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines, which can be fatal. These events can occur at any time during use and without warning symptoms. Elderly patients and patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding are at greater risk for serious GI events (see WARNINGS).

    <Section id="S3" name="precautions">    PRECAUTIONS



   General



  PONSTEL cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids may lead to disease exacerbation.. Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is made to discontinue corticosteroids.



    Information for Patients



  Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide) that accompanies each prescription dispensed. Inform patients, families and their caregivers of the following information before initiating therapy with PONSTEL and periodically during the course of ongoing therapy.



    Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events



  Advise patients to be alert for the symptoms of cardiovascular thrombotic events, including chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, or slurring of speech, and to report any of these symptoms to their healthcare provider immediately (see   WARNINGS; Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events    ).



    Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation



  Advise patients to report symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding, including epigastric pain, dyspepsia, melena, and hematemesis to their healthcare provider. In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, inform patients of the increased risk for and the signs and symptoms of GI bleeding (see   WARNINGS; Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation  ).  



    Hepatotoxicity



  Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, diarrhea, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flu-like" symptoms). If these occur, instruct patients to stop PONSTEL and seek immediate medical therapy (see   WARNINGS; Hepatotoxicity    ).



    Heart Failure and Edema



  Advise patients to be alert for the symptoms of congestive heart failure including shortness of breath, unexplained weight gain, or edema and to contact their healthcare provider if such symptoms occur (see   WARNINGS; Heart Failure and Edema    ).



    Anaphylactic Reactions



  Inform patients of the signs of an anaphylactic reaction (e.g., difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat). Instruct patients to seek immediate emergency help if these occur (see  CONTRAINDICATIONS  ,  WARNINGS; Anaphylactic Reactions    ).



    Serious Skin Reactions



  Advise patients to stop PONSTEL immediately if they develop any type of rash and contact their healthcare provider as soon as possible (see   WARNINGS; Serious Skin Reactions    ).



    Female Fertility



  Advise females of reproductive potential who desire pregnancy that NSAIDs, including PONSTEL, may be associated with a reversible delay in ovulation. (see  PRECAUTIONS; Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  ).  



    Fetal Toxicity



  Inform pregnant women to avoid use of PONSTEL and other NSAIDs starting at 30 weeks gestation because of the risk of the premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus (see  WARNINGS; Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus    ).



    Avoid Concomitant Use of NSAIDs



  Inform patients that the concomitant use of PONSTEL with other NSAIDs or salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) is not recommended due to the increased risk of gastrointestinal toxicity, and little or no increase in efficacy (see  WARNINGS; Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration and Perforation  ,  PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions    ). Alert patients that NSAIDs may be present in "over the counter" medications for treatment of colds, fever, or insomnia.



    Use of NSAIDS and Low-Dose Aspirin



  Inform patients not to use low-dose aspirin concomitantly with PONSTEL until they talk to their healthcare provider (see  PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions  ).  



    Masking of Inflammation and Fever



  The pharmacological activity of PONSTEL in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.



    Laboratory Monitoring



  Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a CBC and a chemistry profile checked periodically (see   WARNINGS; Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration and Perforation  , and  Hepatotoxicity    ).



    Drug Interactions



  See  Table 2  for clinically significant drug interactions with mefenamic acid.



 Table 2: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with mefenamic acid 
  Drugs That Interfere with Hemostasis     
  Clinical Impact:     Mefenamic acid and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding. The concomitant use of mefenamic acid and anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone. 
 Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone. 
                                                                                                                                                                      
    Intervention:      Monitor patients with concomitant use of PONSTEL with anticoagulants (e.g.,warfarin), antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for signs of bleeding (see   WARNINGS; Hematologic Toxicity  )  .   
       Aspirin          
  Clinical Impact:     Controlled clinical studies showed that the concomitant use of NSAIDs and analgesic doses of aspirin does not produce any greater therapeutic effect than the use of NSAIDs alone. In a clinical study, the concomitant use of an NSAID and aspirin was associated with a significantly increased incidence of GI adverse reactions as compared to use of the NSAID alone (see  WARNINGS; Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration and Perforation  )  .   
    Intervention:      Concomitant use of PONSTEL and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended because of the increased risk of bleeding (see   WARNINGS; Hematologic Toxicity  ).  PONSTEL is not a substitute for low dose aspirin for cardiovascular protection.   
  ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, and Beta-Blockers     
  Clinical Impact:     NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or beta-blockers (including propranolol). 
 In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or have renal impairment, co-administration of an NSAID with ACE inhibitors or ARBs may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. 
                                                                                                                                                                      
    Intervention:      During concomitant use of PONSTEL and ACE-inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers, monitor blood pressure to ensure that the desired blood pressure is obtained. 
 During concomitant use of PONSTEL and ACE-inhibitors or ARBs in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted, or have impaired renal function, monitor for signs of worsening renal function (see  WARNINGS; Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia  ).  
 When these drugs are administered concomitantly, patients should be adequately hydrated. Assess renal function at the beginning of the concomitant treatment and periodically thereafter. 
                                                                                                                                                                      
      Diuretics         
  Clinical Impact:     Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, showed that NSAIDs reduced the natriuretic effect of loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) and thiazide diuretics in some patients. This effect has been attributed to the NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis.   
    Intervention       During concomitant use of PONSTEL with diuretics, observe patients for signs of worsening renal function, in addition to assuring diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive effects (see  WARNINGS; Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia  ).     
       Digoxin          
  Clinical Impact:     The concomitant use of mefenamic acid with digoxin has been reported to increase the serum concentration and prolong the half-life of digoxin.   
    Intervention:      During concomitant use of PONSTEL and digoxin, monitor serum digoxin levels.       
       Lithium          
  Clinical Impact:     NSAIDs have produced elevations in plasma lithium levels and reductions in renal lithium clearance .  The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15%, and the renal clearance decreased by approximately 20%. This effect has been attributed to NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis.   
    Intervention:      During concomitant use of PONSTEL and lithium, monitor patients for signs of lithium toxicity.   
    Methotrexate        
  Clinical Impact:     Concomitant use of NSAIDs and methotrexate may increase the risk for methotrexate toxicity (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction).   
    Intervention:      During concomitant use of PONSTEL and methotrexate, monitor patients for methotrexate toxicity.   
    Cyclosporine        
  Clinical Impact:     Concomitant use of PONSTEL and cyclosporine may increase cyclosporine's nephrotoxicity.   
    Intervention:      During concomitant use of PONSTEL and cyclosporine, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.   
  NSAIDs and Salicylates     
  Clinical Impact:     Concomitant use of mefenamic acid with other NSAIDs or salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) increases the risk of GI toxicity, with little or no increase in efficacy (see  WARNINGS; Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration and Perforation  ).     
    Intervention:      The concomitant use of mefenamic acid with other NSAIDs or salicylates is not recommended.   
     Pemetrexed         
  Clinical Impact:     Concomitant use of PONSTEL and pemetrexed may increase the risk of pemetrexed-associated myelosuppression, renal, and GI toxicity (see the pemetrexed prescribing information).   
    Intervention:      During concomitant use of PONSTEL and pemetrexed, in patients with renal impairment whose creatinine clearance ranges from 45 to 79 mL/min, monitor for myelosuppression, renal and GI toxicity.NSAIDs with short elimination half-lives (e.g., diclofenac, indomethacin) should be avoided for a period of two days before, the day of, and two days following administration of pemetrexed.In the absence of data regarding potential interaction between pemetrexed and NSAIDs with longer half-lives (e.g., meloxicam, nabumetone), patients taking these NSAIDs should interrupt dosing for at least five days before, the day of, and two days following pemetrexed administration.   
       Antacid          
  Clinical Impact:     In a single dose study (n=6), ingestion of an antacid containing 1.7-gram of magnesium hydroxide with 500-mg of mefenamic acid increased the Cmaxand AUC of mefenamic acid by 125% and 36%, respectively.   
    Intervention:      Concomitant use of mefenamic acid and antacids is not generally recommended because of possible increased adverse events .   
           Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions
 

  PONSTEL may prolong prothrombin time. Therefore, when the drug is administered to patients receiving oral anticoagulant drugs, frequent monitoring of prothrombin time is necessary.



 A false-positive reaction for urinary bile, using the diazo tablet test, may result after mefenamic acid administration. If biliuria is suspected, other diagnostic procedures, such as the Harrison spot test, should be performed.



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility



   Carcinogenesis



  Long-term studies in animals to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of mefenamic acid have not been conducted.



    Mutagenesis



  Studies to evaluate the mutagenic potential of mefenamic acid have not been completed.



    Impairment of Fertility



  Dietary administration of mefenamic acid to male rats 61 days- and to female rats 15 days- prior to mating through to Gestation Day (GD) 21 at a dose of 155 mg/kg/day (equivalent to the Maximum Recommended Human Dose [MRHD] of 1500 mg/day on a mg/m  2  basis) resulted in decreased corpora lutea.



 In another study, rats administered up to 10-times a human dose of 250 mg showed decreased fertility.



    Pregnancy



   Risk Summary



  Use of NSAIDs, including PONSTEL, during the third trimester of pregnancy increases the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Avoid use of NSAIDs, including PONSTEL, in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of gestation (third trimester) (see  WARNINGS; Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arterious  ).  



 There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of PONSTEL in pregnant women.



 Data from observational studies regarding potential embryofetal risks of NSAID use in women in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. In the general U.S. population, all clinically recognized pregnancies, regardless of drug exposure, have a background rate of 2-4% for major malformations, and 15-20% for pregnancy loss. In animal reproduction studies in rats and rabbits when dosed throughout gestation, there were no evidence of developmental effects at a dose of mefenamic acid 1.6-times and 0.6-times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD), respectively. Dietary administration of mefenamic acid at a dose 1.2-times the MRHD from gestation day (GD) 15 to weaning or at a dose equivalent to the MRHD from 15 days prior to mating through to weaning resulted in greater incidences of perinatal death [see  Data  ].  Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as mefenamic acid, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss.



    Data



   Animal data



  Pregnant rats administered 249 mg/kg of mefenamic acid (1.6-times the MRHD of 1500 mg/day on a mg/m  2  basis) from GD 6 to GD 15 did not result in any clear adverse developmental effects.



 Pregnant rabbits given 50 mg/kg of mefenamic acid (0.6-times the MRHD on a mg/m  2  basis) from GD 6 to GD 18 did not result in any clear treatment-related adverse developmental effects. However, incidences of resorption were greater in treated compared to control animals. This dose was associated with some evidence of maternal toxicity with 4 of 18 rabbits exhibiting diarrhea and weight loss.



 Dietary administration of mefenamic acid at a dose of 181 mg/kg (1.2-times the MRHD on a mg/m  2  basis) to pregnant rats from GD 15 to weaning resulted in an increased incidence of perinatal death. Treated dams were associated with decreased weight gain and delayed parturition. In another study, dietary administration of mefenamic acid at a dose of 155 mg/kg (equivalent to the MRHD of 1500 mg/day on a mg/m  2  basis) to females 15 days prior to mating through to weaning resulted in smaller average litter sizes and higher incidence of perinatal death.



    Labor and Delivery



  In rat studies with NSAIDs, as with other drugs known to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, an increased incidence of dystocia, delayed parturition, decreased pup survival occurred and increased the incidence of stillbirth. The effects of PONSTEL on labor and delivery in pregnant women are unknown.



    Nursing Mothers



  Trace amounts of PONSTEL may be present in breast milk and transmitted to the nursing infant. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from PONSTEL, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.



    Infertility



   Females



  Based on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin-mediated NSAIDs, including PONSTEL may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women. Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin in mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including PONSTEL, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility.



    Pediatric Use



  Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 14 have not been established.



    Geriatric Use



  Elderly patients, compared to younger patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions. If the anticipated benefit for the elderly patient outweighs these potential risks, start dosing at the low end of the dosing range, and monitor patients for adverse effects (see  WARNINGS; Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events  ,  Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation  ,  Hepatotoxicity  ,  Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia  ,  PRECAUTIONS; Laboratory Monitoring  ).  



 Clinical studies of PONSTEL did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. As with any NSAID, caution should be exercised in treating the elderly (65 years and older).



 This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function (See  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  ,  ADVERSE REACTIONS    ).
</Section>
    <Section id="S4" name="warnings">    WARNINGS



   Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events



  Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.



 To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.



 There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as mefenamic acid, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events ( see  WARNINGS; Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation    ).



    Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery



  Two large, controlled, clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10-14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG ( see  CONTRAINDICATIONS  ).  



    Post-MI Patients



  Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up.



 Avoid the use of PONSTEL in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If PONSTEL is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.



    Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation



  NSAIDs, including mefenamic acid, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3-6 months, and in about 2-4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk.



    Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation



  Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy, concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.



    Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients



    *  Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration. 
 *  Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time. 
 *  Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs. 
 *  Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy. 
 *  If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue PONSTEL until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. 
 *  In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding (see  PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions   ). 
       Hepatotoxicity
 

  Elevations of ALT or AST (three or more times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) have been reported in approximately 1% of NSAID-treated patients in clinical trials. In addition, rare, sometimes fatal, cases of severe hepatic injury, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure have been reported.



 Elevations of ALT or AST (less than three times ULN) may occur in up to 15% of patients treated with NSAIDs including mefenamic acid.



 Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flu-like" symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue PONSTEL immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient.



    Hypertension



  NSAIDs, including PONSTEL, can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazides diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs (see  PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions    ).



 Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.



    Heart Failure and Edema



  The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death.



 Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of mefenamic acid may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) (see  PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions    ).



 Avoid the use of PONSTEL in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If PONSTEL is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure.



    Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia



   Renal Toxicity



  Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.



 Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.



 No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of PONSTEL in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of PONSTEL may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with pre-existing renal disease.



 Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating PONSTEL. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of PONSTEL (see   PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions    ). Avoid the use of PONSTEL in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If PONSTEL is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.



    Hyperkalemia



  Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.



    Anaphylactic Reactions



  Mefenamic acid has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to mefenamic acid and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma (see  CONTRAINDICATIONS    ,   WARNINGS; Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity  ).  



 Seek emergency help if anaphylactic reaction occurs.



    Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity



  A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, PONSTEL is contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity (see  CONTRAINDICATIONS    ). When PONSTEL is used in patients with pre-existing asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma.



    Serious Skin Reactions



  NSAIDs, including mefenamic acid, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions and to discontinue the use of PONSTEL at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. PONSTEL is contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs (see  CONTRAINDICATIONS    ).



    Premature Closure of Fetal Ducts Arteriosus



  Mefenamic acid may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus. Avoid use of NSAIDs, including PONSTEL, in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of gestation (third trimester) (see  PRECAUTIONS; Pregnancy    ).



    Hematological Toxicity



  Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with PONSTEL has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit.



 NSAIDs, including PONSTEL, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders or concomitant use of warfarin, other anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding (see  PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions  ).
