  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in other clinical trials of the same or another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 A total of 2711 patients treated with EYLEA constituted the safety population in seven phase 3 studies. Among those, 2110 patients were treated with the recommended dose of 2 mg. Serious adverse reactions related to the injection procedure have occurred in &lt;0.1% of intravitreal injections with EYLEA including endophthalmitis and retinal detachment. The most common adverse reactions (&gt;=5%) reported in patients receiving EYLEA were conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain, cataract, vitreous detachment, vitreous floaters, and intraocular pressure increased.



     Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)  



 The data described below reflect exposure to EYLEA in 1824 patients with wet AMD, including 1223 patients treated with the 2-mg dose, in 2 double-masked, controlled clinical studies (VIEW1 and VIEW2) for 24 months (with active control in year 1) [  see  Clinical Studies (14.1)    ].



 Safety data observed in the EYLEA group in a 52-week, double-masked, Phase 2 study were consistent with these results.

 The data described below reflect 6 months exposure to EYLEA with a monthly 2 mg dose in 218 patients following CRVO in 2 clinical studies (COPERNICUS and GALILEO) and 91 patients following BRVO in one clinical study (VIBRANT) [  see  Clinical Studies (14.2)  ,  (14.3)    ].

   6.2 Immunogenicity

  As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for an immune response in patients treated with EYLEA. The immunogenicity of EYLEA was evaluated in serum samples. The immunogenicity data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were considered positive for antibodies to EYLEA in immunoassays. The detection of an immune response is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assays used, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to EYLEA with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.



 In the wet AMD, RVO, and DME studies, the pre-treatment incidence of immunoreactivity to EYLEA was approximately 1% to 3% across treatment groups. After dosing with EYLEA for 24-100 weeks, antibodies to EYLEA were detected in a similar percentage range of patients. There were no differences in efficacy or safety between patients with or without immunoreactivity.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Endophthalmitis and retinal detachments may occur following intravitreal injections. Patients should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment without delay and should be managed appropriately. (  5.1  ) 
 *  Increases in intraocular pressure have been seen within 60 minutes of an intravitreal injection. (  5.2  ) 
 *  There is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors. (  5.3  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Endophthalmitis and Retinal Detachments



  Intravitreal injections, including those with EYLEA, have been associated with endophthalmitis and retinal detachments [ see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ]. Proper aseptic injection technique must always be used when administering EYLEA. Patients should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment without delay and should be managed appropriately [ see  Dosage and Administration (2.7)  and  Patient Counseling Information (17)    ].



    5.2 Increase in Intraocular Pressure



  Acute increases in intraocular pressure have been seen within 60 minutes of intravitreal injection, including with EYLEA [ see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ]. Sustained increases in intraocular pressure have also been reported after repeated intravitreal dosing with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors. Intraocular pressure and the perfusion of the optic nerve head should be monitored and managed appropriately [ see  Dosage and Administration (2.7)    ].



    5.3 Thromboembolic Events



   There is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors, including EYLEA. ATEs are defined as nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or vascular death (including deaths of unknown cause). The incidence of reported thromboembolic events in wet AMD studies during the first year was 1.8% (32 out of 1824) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 1.5% (9 out of 595) in patients treated with ranibizumab; through 96 weeks, the incidence was 3.3% (60 out of 1824) in the EYLEA group compared with 3.2% (19 out of 595) in the ranibizumab group. The incidence in the DME studies from baseline to week 52 was 3.3% (19 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 2.8% (8 out of 287) in the control group; from baseline to week 100, the incidence was 6.4% (37 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 4.2% (12 out of 287) in the control group. There were no reported thromboembolic events in the patients treated with EYLEA in the first six months of the RVO studies.
