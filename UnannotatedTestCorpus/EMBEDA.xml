  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 In the randomized study, the most common adverse reactions with EMBEDA therapy were constipation, nausea, and somnolence. The most common adverse reactions leading to study discontinuation were nausea, constipation (sometimes severe), vomiting, fatigue, dizziness, pruritus, and somnolence.



     Short-Term Randomized Study  



 This study utilized an enriched enrollment with a randomized withdrawal design in which subjects were titrated to effect on open-label EMBEDA for up to 45 days. Once their pain was controlled, 344 of 547 subjects were randomized to either an active treatment with EMBEDA or were tapered off EMBEDA using a double-dummy design and placed on placebo. The maintenance Period was 12 weeks. Adverse reactions, reported in &gt;=2% of subjects in either the titration or maintenance phase of the 12-week study are presented in Table 1.

              Long-Term Open-Label Safety Study  
 

 In the long-term open-label safety study, 465 patients with chronic non-malignant pain were enrolled and 124 patients were treated for up to 1 year. The distributions of adverse events were similar to that of the randomized, controlled studies, and were consistent with the most common opioid-related adverse reactions. Adverse reactions reported in &gt;=2.0% of subjects are presented in Table 2.

   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of morphine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Serotonin syndrome  : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs.



   Adrenal insufficiency  : Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use.



   Anaphylaxis  : Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in EMBEDA.

    Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse  



   EMBEDA  (r)   exposes patients and other users to the risks of opioid addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess each patient's risk prior to prescribing EMBEDA, and monitor all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors and conditions   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ].    



     Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)    



     To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a REMS for these products   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ].   Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to    



 *  complete a REMS-compliant education program, 
 *  counsel patients and/or their caregivers, with every prescription, on safe use, serious risks, storage, and disposal of these products, 
 *  emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide every time it is provided by their pharmacist, and 
 *  consider other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety. 
      Life-threatening Respiratory Depression  
 

   Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of EMBEDA. Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of EMBEDA or following a dose increase  .   Instruct patients to swallow EMBEDA capsules whole, or to sprinkle the contents of the capsule on applesauce and swallow immediately without chewing. Crushing, chewing, or dissolving the pellets in EMBEDA can cause rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of morphine   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  .   



   Accidental Ingestion  



   Accidental ingestion of even one dose of EMBEDA, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of morphine   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  .  



   Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome  



   Prolonged use of EMBEDA during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.4)  ]  .  



   Interaction with Alcohol  



   Instruct patients not to consume alcoholic beverages or use prescription or non-prescription products that contain alcohol while taking EMBEDA. The co-ingestion of alcohol with EMBEDA may result in increased plasma level and a potentially fatal overdose of morphine   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.5)  ]  .  



   Risks From Concomitant Use With Benzodiazepines Or Other CNS Depressants  



   Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.5)  ,   Drug Interactions (7)  ]  .  



 *  Reserve concomitant prescribing of EMBEDA and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. 
 *  Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. 
 *  Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.

 *   Risk of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury or Impaired Consciousness : Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of EMBEDA in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. (  5.10  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse



  EMBEDA contains morphine, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, EMBEDA exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see  Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)  ].  Because extended-release products such as EMBEDA deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of morphine present [see  Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)  ]  .



 Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed EMBEDA. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused.



 Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing EMBEDA, and monitor all patients receiving EMBEDA for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as EMBEDA, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of EMBEDA along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse.



 Abuse or misuse of EMBEDA by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product will result in the uncontrolled delivery of the morphine and can result in overdose and death [see  Overdosage (10)  ]  . Misuse or abuse of EMBEDA by these methods may also release sufficient naltrexone to precipitate withdrawal in opioid-dependent individuals [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.13)  ]  .



 Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing EMBEDA. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see  Patient Counseling Information (17)  ]  . Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.



    5.2 Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)



   To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to do all of the following:  



 *   Complete a REMS-compliant education program offered by an accredited provider of continuing education (CE) or another education program that includes all the elements of the FDA Education Blueprint for Health Care Providers Involved in the Management or Support of Patients with Pain.  
 *   Discuss the safe use, serious risks, and proper storage and disposal of opioid analgesics with patients and/or their caregivers every time these medicines are prescribed. The Patient Counseling Guide (PCG) can be obtained at this link: www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSPCG.  
 *   Emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide that they will receive from their pharmacist every time an opioid analgesic is dispensed to them.  
 *   Consider using other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety, such as patient-prescriber agreements that reinforce patient-prescriber responsibilities.  
     To obtain further information on the opioid analgesic REMS and for a list of accredited REMS CME/CE, call 1-800-503-0784, or log on to www.opioidanalgesicrems.com. The FDA Blueprint can be found at www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSBlueprint.  
 

    5.3 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression



  Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see  Overdosage (10)  ]  . Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.



 While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of EMBEDA, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression especially during the first 24-72 hours of initiating therapy with and following dosage increases of EMBEDA.



 To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of EMBEDA are essential [see  Dosage and Administration (2)  ]  . Overestimating the EMBEDA dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in fatal overdose with the first dose.



 Accidental ingestion of even one dose of EMBEDA, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of morphine.



    5.4 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome



  Prolonged use of EMBEDA during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ,  Patient Counseling Information (17)  ]  .



    5.5 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants



  Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of EMBEDA with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.



 Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see  Drug Interactions (7)    ].



 If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.



 Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when EMBEDA is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [see  Drug Interactions (7)  ,  Patient Counseling Information (17)  ]  .



 Patients must not consume alcoholic beverages or prescription or non-prescription products containing alcohol while on EMBEDA therapy. The co-ingestion of alcohol with EMBEDA may result in increased plasma levels and a potentially fatal overdose of morphine [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ].  



    5.6 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients



  The use of EMBEDA in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated.



    Patients with chronic pulmonary disease:  EMBEDA-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of EMBEDA [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ].  



    



   Elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients:  Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ].  



 Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating EMBEDA and when EMBEDA is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3  ,  5.5)  ]  . Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients.



    5.7 Interaction with Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors



  Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) may potentiate the effects of morphine, including respiratory depression, coma, and confusion. EMBEDA should not be used in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment.



    5.8 Adrenal Insufficiency



  Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.



    5.9 Severe Hypotension



  EMBEDA may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see  Drug Interactions (7)  ]  . Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of EMBEDA. In patients with circulatory shock, EMBEDA may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of EMBEDA in patients with circulatory shock.



    5.10 Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness



  In patients susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), EMBEDA may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2retention can further increase intracranial pressure .  Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with EMBEDA.



 Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of EMBEDA in patients with impaired consciousness or coma.



    5.11 Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions



  EMBEDA is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The morphine in EMBEDA may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms.



    5.12 Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders



  The morphine in EMBEDA may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during EMBEDA therapy.



    5.13 Withdrawal



  Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who have received or are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including EMBEDA. In these patients, mixed agonists/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms.



 Consuming EMBEDA capsules that have been altered by crushing, chewing, or dissolving the pellets can release sufficient naltrexone to precipitate withdrawal in opioid-dependent individuals. Symptoms of withdrawal usually appear within five minutes of ingestion of naltrexone, can last for up to 48 hours, and can include mental status changes, restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Significant fluid losses from vomiting and diarrhea can require intravenous (IV) fluid administration.



 When discontinuing EMBEDA, gradually taper the dosage [see  Dosage and Administration (2.5)  ]  . Do not abruptly discontinue EMBEDA [see  Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)  ]  .



    5.14 Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery



  EMBEDA may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of EMBEDA and know how they will react to the medication [see  Patient Counseling Information (17)  ]  .



    5.15 Interference with Laboratory Tests



  Naltrexone does not interfere with thin-layer, gas-liquid, and high performance liquid chromatographic methods which may be used for the separation and detection of morphine, methadone, or quinine in the urine. Naltrexone may or may not interfere with enzymatic methods for the detection of opioids depending on the specificity of the test. Consult the test manufacturer for specific details.
