    BOXED WARNING: 

    BlisoviTM     Fe     1/20  



   (norethindrone     acetate     and     ethinyl     estradiol     tablets     USP     and     ferrous     fumarate     tablets*)  



   1     mg/0.02     mg  



 *Ferrous fumarate tablets are not USP for dissolution 



 The patient labeling for oral contraceptive drug products is set forth below:



   This     product     (like all oral contraceptives) is intended to prevent pregnancy. It does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS)     and other sexually transmitted     diseases.  



   BRIEF SUMMARY PATIENT PACKAGE INSERT

  Oral contraceptives, also known as "birth control pills" or "the pill," are taken to prevent pregnancy and, when taken correctly, have a failure rate of about 1% per year when used without missing any pills. The typical failure rate of large numbers of pill users is less than 3% per year when women who miss pills are included. For most women, oral contraceptives are also free of serious or unpleasant side effects. However, forgetting to take pills considerably increases the chances of pregnancy.



 For the majority of women, oral contraceptives can be taken safely. But there are some women who are at high risk of developing certain serious diseases that can be life-threatening or may cause temporary or permanent disability. The risks associated with taking oral contraceptives increase significantly if you:



 *  Smoke 
 *  Have high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol 
 *  Have or have had clotting disorders, heart attack, stroke, angina pectoris, cancer of the breast or sex organs, jaundice, or malignant or benign liver tumors. 
    You should not take the pill if you suspect you are pregnant or have unexplained vaginal bleeding.
 

     Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular side effects from oral contraceptive use. This risk increases with age and with heavy smoking (15 or more cigarettes per day) and is quite marked in women over 35 years of age. Women who use oral contraceptives are strongly advised not to smoke.  



   Most side effects of the pill are not serious. The most common side effects are nausea, vomiting, bleeding between menstrual periods, weight gain, breast tenderness, and difficulty wearing contact lenses. These side effects, especially nausea, vomiting, and breakthrough bleeding may subside within the first three months of use.



 The serious side effects of the pill occur very infrequently, especially if you are in good health and are young. However, you should know that the following medical conditions have been associated with or made worse by the pill:



   1    Blood clots in the legs (thrombophlebitis), lungs (pulmonary embolism), stoppage or rupture of a blood vessel in the brain (stroke), blockage of blood vessels in the heart (heart attack or angina pectoris) or other organs of the body. As mentioned above, smoking increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes and subsequent serious medical consequences.



   2    Liver tumors, which may rupture and cause severe bleeding. A possible but not definite association has been found with the pill and liver cancer. However, liver cancers are extremely rare. The chance of developing liver cancer from using the pill is thus even rarer.



   3    High blood pressure, although blood pressure usually returns to normal when the pill is stopped.



 The symptoms associated with these serious side effects are discussed in the detailed leaflet given to you with your supply of pills. Notify your doctor or healthcare provider if you notice any unusual physical disturbances while taking the pill. In addition, drugs such as rifampin, as well as some anticonvulsants and some antibiotics, may decrease oral contraceptive effectiveness.



 Most of the studies to date on breast cancer and pill use have found no increase in the risk of developing breast cancer, although some studies have reported an increased risk of developing breast cancer in certain groups of women. However, some studies have found an increase in the risk of developing cancer of the cervix in women taking the pill, but this finding may be related to differences in sexual behavior or other factors not related to use of the pill. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to rule out the possibility that the pill may cause cancer of the breast or cervix. 



 Taking the pill provides some important non-contraceptive benefits. These include less painful menstruation, less menstrual blood loss and anemia, fewer pelvic infections, and fewer cancers of the ovary and the lining of the uterus.



 Be sure to discuss any medical condition you may have with your healthcare provider. Your healthcare provider will take a medical and family history and examine you before prescribing oral contraceptives. The physical examination may be delayed to another time if you request it and your healthcare provider believes that it is a good medical practice to postpone it. You should be reexamined at least once a year while taking oral contraceptives. The detailed patient information leaflet gives you further information which you should read and discuss with your healthcare provider.



   This     product     (like     all     oral     contraceptives)     is     intended     to     prevent     pregnancy.     It     does     not     protect     against     transmission     of     HIV     (AIDS)     and     other     sexually     transmitted     diseases     such     as     chlamydia  ,   genital     herpes  ,   genital     warts  ,   gonorrhea  ,   hepatitis     B     and     syphilis.

   HOW TO TAKE THE PILL

   
 IMPORTANT POINTS TO REMEMBER                                                                           
         BEFORE   YOU START TAKING YOUR PILLS:
 

 1. BE SURE TO READ THESE DIRECTIONS: 



         Before you start taking your pills



         Anytime you are not sure what to do



 2. THE RIGHT WAY TO TAKE THE PILL IS TO TAKE ONE PILL EVERY DAY AT THE SAME TIME. If you miss pills you could get pregnant. This includes starting the pack late. The more pills you miss, the more likely you are to get pregnant.



 3. MANY WOMEN HAVE SPOTTING OR LIGHT BLEEDING, OR MAY FEEL SICK TO THEIR STOMACH, DURING THE FIRST 1-3 PACKS OF PILLS. If you do have spotting or light bleeding or feel sick to your stomach, do not stop taking the pill. The problem will usually go away. If it doesn't go away, check with your doctor or clinic.



 4. MISSING PILLS CAN ALSO CAUSE SPOTTING OR LIGHT BLEEDING, even when you make up these missed pills. On the days you take 2 pills to make up for missed pills, you could also feel a little sick to your stomach.



 5. IF YOU HAVE VOMITING OR DIARRHEA, for any reason, or IF YOU TAKE SOME MEDICINES, including some antibiotics, your birth control pills may not work as well. Use a back-up birth control method (such as condoms or foam) until you check with your doctor or clinic.



 6. IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE REMEMBERING TO TAKE THE PILL, talk to your doctor or clinic about how to make pill-taking easier or about using another method of birth control.



 7. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR ARE UNSURE ABOUT THE INFORMATION IN THIS LEAFLET, call your doctor or clinic.




 BEFORE YOU START TAKING YOUR PILLS                                                                     
       1. DECIDE WHAT TIME OF DAY YOU WANT TO TAKE YOUR PILL. It is important to take it at about the same time every day.
 

 2. LOOK AT YOUR PILL PACK TO SEE IF IT HAS 28 PILLS:



       The   28-Day pill pack   has 21 "active" yellow pills (with hormones) to take for 3 weeks, followed by 1 week of reminder brown pills (without hormones).



 3. ALSO FIND:



       1)   where on the pack to start taking pills,



       2)   in what order to take the pills (follow the arrows), and



       3)   the week numbers as shown in the following picture:



 For use of day labels, see   WHEN     TO     START     THE     FIRST     PACK     OF     PILLS   below.



 4. BE SURE YOU HAVE READY AT ALL TIMES:



 ANOTHER KIND OF BIRTH CONTROL (such as condoms or foam) to use as a back-up in case you miss pills.



 An EXTRA, FULL PILL PACK.




 WHEN TO START THE FIRST PACK OF PILLS                                                                  
       You have a choice of which day to start taking your first pack of pills. Decide with your doctor or clinic which is the best day for you. Pick a time of day which will be easy to remember. 
 

   DAY-1     START:  



 1. Pick the day label strip that starts with the first day of your period. (This is the day you start bleeding or spotting, even if it is almost midnight when the bleeding begins.)



 2. Place this day label strip on the wallet over the area that has the days of the week (starting with Sunday) printed on the wallet.



 3. Take the first "active" yellow pill of the first pack during the   first 24 hours of your period  .



 4. You will not need to use a back-up method of birth control, since you are starting the pill at the beginning of your period. 



   SUNDAY     START:  



 1. Take the first "active" yellow pill of the first pack on the   Sunday after your period starts  , even if you are still bleeding. If your period begins on Sunday, start the pack that same day.



 2.   Use another method of birth control   as a back-up method if you have sex anytime from the Sunday you start your first pack until the next Sunday (7 days). Condoms or foam are good back-up methods of birth control.




 WHAT TO DO DURING THE MONTH                                                                            
       1.           TAKE     ONE     PILL     AT     THE     SAME     TIME     EVERY     DAY     UNTIL     THE     PACK     IS     EMPTY.  
 

 Do not skip pills even if you are spotting or bleeding between monthly periods or feel sick to your stomach (nausea). 



 Do not skip pills even if you do not have sex very often.



 2.           WHEN     YOU     FINISH     A     PACK     OR     SWITCH     YOUR     BRAND     OF     PILLS:  



 Start the next pack on the day after your last "reminder" pill. Do not wait any days between packs.

       If you   MISS     1   yellow "active" pill:
 

 1. Take it as soon as you remember. Take the next pill at your regular time. This means you may take 2 pills in 1 day.



 2. You do not need to use a back-up birth control method if you have sex.



 If you   MISS     2   yellow "active" pills in a row in   WEEK     1     OR     WEEK     2   of your pack:



 1. Take 2 pills on the day you remember and 2 pills the next day.



 2. Then take 1 pill a day until you finish the pack.



 3. You COULD GET PREGNANT if you have sex in the   7 days   after you miss pills. You MUST use another birth control method (such as condoms or foam) as a back-up method of birth control until you have taken a yellow "active" pill every day for 7 days.

 3. You COULD GET PREGNANT if you have sex in the   7 days   after you miss pills. You MUST use another birth control method (such as condoms or foam) as a back-up method of birth control until you have taken a yellow "active" pill every day for 7 days.



 If you   MISS     3     OR     MORE   yellow "active" pills in a row (during the first 3 weeks):



 1.           If     you     are     a     Day-1     Starter:

    BOXED WARNING: 

    DETAILED     PATIENT     PACKAGE     INSERT  



   What     You     Should     Know     About     Oral     Contraceptives  



 Any woman who considers using oral contraceptives (the "birth control pill" or "the pill") should understand the benefits and risks of using this form of birth control. This leaflet will give you much of the information you will need to make this decision and will also help you determine if you are at risk of developing any of the serious side effects of the pill. It will tell you how to use the pill properly so that it will be as effective as possible. However, this leaflet is not a replacement for a careful discussion between you and your healthcare provider. You should discuss the information provided in this leaflet with him or her, both when you first start taking the pill and during your revisits. You should also follow your healthcare provider's advice with regard to regular check-ups while you are on the pill. 



   EFFECTIVENESS OF ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES

  Oral contraceptives or "birth control pills" or "the pill" are used to prevent pregnancy and are more effective than other non-surgical methods of birth control. When they are taken correctly, the chance of becoming pregnant is less than 1% (1 pregnancy per 100 women per year of use) when used perfectly, without missing any pills. Typical failure rates are actually 3% per year. The chance of becoming pregnant increases with each missed pill during a menstrual cycle. 



 In comparison, typical failure rates for other methods of birth control during the first year of use are as follows:




 Implant: &lt;1%                                        Male sterilization: &lt;1%                              
 Injection: &lt;1%                                      Cervical Cap: 20 to 40%                              
 IUD: &lt;1 to 2%                                       Condom alone (male): 14%                             
 Diaphragm with spermicides: 20%                     Condom alone (female): 21%                           
 Spermicides alone: 26%                              Periodic abstinence: 25%                             
 Vaginal Sponge: 20 to 40%                           Withdrawal: 19%                                      
 Female sterilization: &lt;1%                           No method: 85%                                       
          WHO SHOULD NOT TAKE ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES
     Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular side effects from oral contraceptive use. This risk increases with age and with heavy smoking (15 or more cigarettes per day) and is quite marked in women over 35 years of age. Women who use oral contraceptives are strongly advised not to smoke.  



     Some     women     should     not     use     the     pill.     For     example  ,   you     should     not     take     the     pill     if     you     are     pregnant     or     think     you     may     be     pregnant.     You     should     also     not     use     the     pill     if     you     have     any     of     the     following     conditions  



       A history of heart attack or stroke



       Blood clots in the legs (thrombophlebitis), lungs (pulmonary embolism), or eyes



       A history of blood clots in the deep veins of your legs



       Chest pain (angina pectoris)



       Known or suspected breast cancer or cancer of the lining of the uterus, cervix, or vagina



       Unexplained vaginal bleeding (until a diagnosis is reached by your doctor)



       Yellowing of the whites of the eyes or of the skin (jaundice) during pregnancy or during previous use of the pill



       Liver tumor (benign or cancerous)



       Take any Hepatitis C drug combination containing ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir. This may increase levels of the liver enzyme "alanine aminotransferase" (ALT) in the blood.



       Known or suspected pregnancy



 Tell your healthcare provider if you have ever had any of these conditions. Your healthcare provider can recommend a safer method of birth control.



   OTHER CONSIDERATIONS BEFORE TAKING ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES

  Tell your healthcare provider if you have:



       Breast nodules, fibrocystic disease of the breast, an abnormal breast x-ray or mammogram



       Diabetes



       Elevated cholesterol or triglycerides



       High blood pressure



       Migraine or other headaches or epilepsy



       Mental depression



       Gallbladder, heart or kidney disease



       History of scanty or irregular menstrual periods



 Women with any of these conditions should be checked often by their healthcare provider if they choose to use oral contraceptives. 



 Also, be sure to inform your doctor or healthcare provider if you smoke or are on any medications. 



   RISKS OF TAKING ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES

    1.         Risk     of     Developing     Blood     Clots  



 Blood clots and blockage of blood vessels are the most serious side effects of taking oral contraceptives; in particular, a clot in the legs can cause thrombophlebitis, and a clot that travels to the lungs can cause a sudden blocking of the vessel carrying blood to the lungs. Rarely, clots occur in the blood vessels of the eye and may cause blindness, double vision, or impaired vision.



 If you take oral contraceptives and need elective surgery, need to stay in bed for a prolonged illness, or have recently delivered a baby, you may be at risk of developing blood clots. You should consult your doctor about stopping oral contraceptives three to four weeks before surgery and not taking oral contraceptives for two weeks after surgery or during bed rest. You should also not take oral contraceptives soon after delivery of a baby. It is advisable to wait for at least four weeks after delivery if you are not breastfeeding. If you are breastfeeding, you should wait until you have weaned your child before using the pill.   (See     also     the     section     on     Breastfeeding     in       GENERAL PRECAUTIONS  .)  



   2.         Heart     Attacks     and     Strokes  



 Oral contraceptives may increase the tendency to develop strokes (stoppage or rupture of blood vessels in the brain) and angina pectoris and heart attacks (blockage of blood vessels in the heart). Any of these conditions can cause death or disability. 



 Smoking greatly increases the possibility of suffering heart attacks and strokes. Furthermore, smoking and the use of oral contraceptives greatly increase the chances of developing and dying of heart disease.



   3.         Gallbladder     Disease  



 Oral contraceptive users probably have a greater risk than nonusers of having gallbladder disease, although this risk may be related to pills containing high doses of estrogens.



   4.         Liver     Tumors  



 In rare cases, oral contraceptives can cause benign but dangerous liver tumors. These benign liver tumors can rupture and cause fatal internal bleeding. In addition, a possible but not definite association has been found with the pill and liver cancers in two studies, in which a few women who developed these very rare cancers were found to have used oral contraceptives for long periods. However, liver cancers are extremely rare. The chance of developing liver cancer from using the pill is thus even rarer.



   5.         Cancer     of     the     Reproductive     Organs     and     Breasts  



 There is, at present, no confirmed evidence that oral contraceptive use increases the risk of developing cancer of the reproductive organs. Studies to date of women taking the pill have reported conflicting findings on whether pill use increases the risk of developing cancer of the breast or cervix. Most of the studies on breast cancer and pill use have found no overall increase in the risk of developing breast cancer, although some studies have reported an increased risk of developing breast cancer in certain groups of women. Women who use oral contraceptives and have a strong family history of breast cancer or who have breast nodules or abnormal mammograms should be closely followed by their doctors. 



 Some studies have found an increase in the incidence of cancer of the cervix in women who use oral contraceptives. However, this finding may be related to factors other than the use of oral contraceptives.



   ESTIMATED RISK OF DEATH FROM A BIRTH CONTROL METHOD OR PREGNANCY

  All methods of birth control and pregnancy are associated with a risk of developing certain diseases which may lead to disability or death. An estimate of the number of deaths associated with different methods of birth control and pregnancy has been calculated and is shown in the following table.



 ANNUAL NUMBER OF BIRTH-RELATED OR METHOD-RELATED DEATHS ASSOCIATED WITH CONTROL OF FERTILITY PER 100,000 NONSTERILE WOMEN, BY FERTILITY CONTROL METHOD ACCORDING TO AGE

             In the above table, the risk of death from any birth control method is less than the risk of childbirth, except for oral contraceptive users over the age of 35 who smoke and pill users over the age of 40 even if they do not smoke. It can be seen in the table that for women aged 15 to 39, the risk of death was highest with pregnancy (7 to 26 deaths per 100,000 women, depending on age). Among pill users who do not smoke, the risk of death was always lower than that associated with pregnancy for any age group, although over the age of 40, the risk increases to 32 deaths per 100,000 women, compared to 28 associated with pregnancy at that age. However, for pill users who smoke and are over the age of 35, the estimated number of deaths exceeds those for other methods of birth control. If a woman is over the age of 40 and smokes, her estimated risk of death is four times higher (117/100,000 women) than the estimated risk associated with pregnancy (28/100,000 women) in that age group. 
 

 The suggestion that women over 40 who don't smoke should not take oral contraceptives is based on information from older higher dose pills and on less selective use of pills than is practiced today. An Advisory Committee of the FDA discussed this issue in 1989 and recommended that the benefits of oral contraceptive use by healthy, non-smoking women over 40 years of age may outweigh the possible risks. However, all women, especially older women, are cautioned to use the lowest dose pill that is effective.



   WARNING SIGNALS

  If any of these adverse effects occur while you are taking oral contraceptives, call your doctor immediately:



       Sharp chest pain, coughing of blood, or sudden shortness of breath (indicating a possible clot in the lung)



       Pain in the calf (indicating a possible clot in the leg)



       Crushing chest pain or heaviness in the chest (indicating a possible heart attack)



       Sudden severe headache or vomiting, dizziness or fainting, disturbances of vision or speech, weakness, or numbness in an arm or leg (indicating a possible stroke)



       Sudden partial or complete loss of vision (indicating a possible clot in the eye)



       Breast lumps (indicating possible breast cancer or fibrocystic disease of the breast; ask your doctor or healthcare provider to show you how to examine your breasts)



       Severe pain or tenderness in the stomach area (indicating a possibly ruptured liver tumor)



       Difficulty in sleeping, weakness, lack of energy, fatigue, or change in mood (possibly indicating severe depression)



       Jaundice or a yellowing of the skin or eyeballs, accompanied frequently by fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, dark colored urine, or light colored bowel movements (indicating possible liver problems)



   SIDE EFFECTS OF ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES

    1.         Vaginal     Bleeding  



 Irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting may occur while you are taking the pills. Irregular bleeding may vary from slight staining between menstrual periods to breakthrough bleeding which is a flow much like a regular period. Irregular bleeding occurs most often during the first few months of oral contraceptive use, but may also occur after you have been taking the pill for some time. Such bleeding may be temporary and usually does not indicate serious problems. It is important to continue taking your pills on schedule. If the bleeding occurs in more than one cycle or lasts for more than a few days, talk to your doctor or healthcare provider.



   2.         Contact     Lenses  



 If you wear contact lenses and notice a change in vision or an inability to wear your lenses, contact your doctor or healthcare provider.



   3.         Fluid     Retention  



 Oral contraceptives may cause edema (fluid retention) with swelling of the fingers or ankles and may raise your blood pressure. If you experience fluid retention, contact your doctor or healthcare provider.



   4.         Melasma  



 A spotty darkening of the skin is possible, particularly of the face.



   5.         Other     Side     Effects  



 Other side effects may include change in appetite, headache, nervousness, depression, dizziness, loss of scalp hair, rash, and vaginal infections. 



 If any of these side effects bother you, call your doctor or healthcare provider.



   GENERAL PRECAUTIONS

    1.         Missed     Periods     and     Use     of     Oral     Contraceptives     Before     or     During     Early     Pregnancy  



 There may be times when you may not menstruate regularly after you have completed taking a cycle of pills. If you have taken your pills regularly and miss one menstrual period, continue taking your pills for the next cycle but be sure to inform your healthcare provider before doing so. If you have not taken the pills daily as instructed and missed a menstrual period, or if you missed two consecutive menstrual periods, you may be pregnant. Check with your healthcare provider immediately to determine whether you are pregnant. Do not continue to take oral contraceptives until you are sure you are not pregnant, but continue to use another method of contraception. There is no conclusive evidence that oral contraceptive use is associated with an increase in birth defects, when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Previously, a few studies had reported that oral contraceptives might be associated with birth defects, but these studies have not been confirmed. Nevertheless, oral contraceptives or any other drugs should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary and prescribed by your doctor. You should check with your doctor about risks to your unborn child of any medication taken during pregnancy.



   2.         While     Breastfeeding  



 If you are breastfeeding, consult your doctor before starting oral contraceptives. Some of the drug will be passed on to the child in the milk. A few adverse effects on the child have been reported, including yellowing of the skin (jaundice) and breast enlargement. In addition, oral contraceptives may decrease the amount and quality of your milk. If possible, do not use oral contraceptives while breastfeeding. You should use another method of contraception since breastfeeding provides only partial protection from becoming pregnant, and this partial protection decreases significantly as you breastfeed for longer periods of time. You should consider starting oral contraceptives only after you have weaned your child completely.



   3.         Laboratory     Tests  



 If you are scheduled for any laboratory tests, tell your doctor you are taking birth control pills. Certain blood tests may be affected by birth control pills.



   4.         Drug     Interactions  



 Certain drugs may interact with birth control pills to make them less effective in preventing pregnancy or cause an increase in breakthrough bleeding. Such drugs include rifampin; drugs used for epilepsy such as barbiturates (for example, phenobarbital), carbamazepine, and phenytoin (Dilantin  (r)   is one brand of this drug); troglitazone; phenylbutazone; and possibly certain antibiotics. You may need to use additional contraception when you take drugs which can make oral contraceptives less effective. 



 Birth control pills interact with certain drugs. These drugs include acetaminophen, clofibric acid, cyclosporine, morphine, prednisolone, salicylic acid, temazepam, and theophylline. You should tell your doctor if you are taking any of these medications.



   5.         This     product     (like     all     oral     contraceptives)     is     intended     to     prevent     pregnancy.     It     does     not     protect     against     transmission     of     HIV     (AIDS)     and     other     sexually     transmitted     diseases     such     as     chlamydia  ,   genital     herpes  ,   genital     warts  ,   gonorrhea  ,   hepatitis     B  ,   and     syphilis.

   HOW TO TAKE THE PILL

   
 IMPORTANT POINTS TO REMEMBER                                                                           
         BEFORE   YOU START TAKING YOUR PILLS:
 

 1. BE SURE TO READ THESE DIRECTIONS: 



         Before you start taking your pills



         Anytime you are not sure what to do



 2. THE RIGHT WAY TO TAKE THE PILL IS TO TAKE ONE PILL EVERY DAY AT THE SAME TIME. If you miss pills you could get pregnant. This includes starting the pack late. The more pills you miss, the more likely you are to get pregnant.



 3. MANY WOMEN HAVE SPOTTING OR LIGHT BLEEDING, OR MAY FEEL SICK TO THEIR STOMACH DURING THE FIRST 1-3 PACKS OF PILLS. If you do have spotting or light bleeding or feel sick to your stomach, do not stop taking the pill. The problem will usually go away. If it doesn't go away, check with your doctor or clinic.



 4. MISSING PILLS CAN ALSO CAUSE SPOTTING OR LIGHT BLEEDING, even when you make up these missed pills. On the days you take 2 pills to make up for missed pills, you could also feel a little sick to your stomach.



 5. IF YOU HAVE VOMITING OR DIARRHEA, for any reason, or IF YOU TAKE SOME MEDICINES, including some antibiotics, your birth control pills may not work as well. Use a back-up birth control method (such as condoms or foam) until you check with your doctor or clinic.



 6. IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE REMEMBERING TO TAKE THE PILL, talk to your doctor or clinic about how to make pill-taking easier or about using another method of birth control.



 7. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR ARE UNSURE ABOUT THE INFORMATION IN THIS LEAFLET, call your doctor or clinic.




 BEFORE YOU START TAKING YOUR PILLS                                                                     
       1. DECIDE WHAT TIME OF DAY YOU WANT TO TAKE YOUR PILL. It is important to take it at about the same time every day.
 

 2. LOOK AT YOUR PILL PACK TO SEE IF IT HAS 28 PILLS:



 The   28-Day pill pack   has 21 "active" yellow pills (with hormones) to take for 3 weeks, followed by 1 week of reminder brown pills (without hormones).



 3. ALSO FIND:



       1) where on the pack to start taking pills,



       2) in what order to take the pills (follow the arrows), and



       3) the week numbers as shown in the following picture:



 For use of day labels, see   WHEN     TO     START     THE     FIRST     PACK     OF     PILLS   below.



 4.         BE SURE YOU HAVE READY AT ALL TIMES:



     ANOTHER KIND OF BIRTH CONTROL (such as condoms or foam) to use as a back-up in case you miss pills.



     An EXTRA, FULL PILL PACK.




 WHEN TO START THE FIRST PACK OF PILLS                                                                  
       You have a choice of which day to start taking your first pack of pills. Decide with your doctor or clinic which is the best day for you. Pick a time of day which will be easy to remember.
 

   DAY-1     START:  



 1.         Pick the day label strip that starts with the first day of your period. (This is the day you start bleeding or spotting, even if it is almost midnight when the bleeding begins.) 



 2.         Place this day label strip on the wallet over the area that has the days of the week (starting with Sunday) printed on the wallet.



 3. Take the first "active" yellow pill of the first pack during the   first 24 hours of your period  .



 4. You will not need to use a back-up method of birth control, since you are starting the pill at the beginning of your period.



   SUNDAY     START:  



 1.         Take the first "active" yellow pill of the first pack on the   Sunday after your period starts  , even if you are still bleeding. If your period begins on Sunday, start the pack that same day.



 2.           Use another method of birth control   as a back-up method if you have sex anytime from the Sunday you start your first pack until the next Sunday (7 days). Condoms or foam are good back-up methods of birth control.




 WHAT TO DO DURING THE MONTH                                                                            
       1.           TAKE     ONE     PILL     AT     THE     SAME     TIME     EVERY     DAY     UNTIL     THE     PACK     IS     EMPTY.  
 

 Do not skip pills even if you are spotting or bleeding between monthly periods or feel sick to your stomach (nausea). 



 Do not skip pills even if you do not have sex very often.



 2.           WHEN     YOU     FINISH     A     PACK     OR     SWITCH     YOUR     BRAND     OF     PILLS:  



 Start the next pack on the day after your last "reminder" pill. Do not wait any days between packs.




 WHAT TO DO IF YOU MISS PILLS                                                                           
       If you   MISS     1   yellow "active" pill:
 

 1.         Take it as soon as you remember. Take the next pill at your regular time. This means you may take 2 pills in 1 day.



 2.         You do not need to use a back-up birth control method if you have sex.



 If you   MISS     2   yellow "active" pills in a row in   WEEK     1     OR     WEEK     2   of your pack:



 1.         Take 2 pills on the day you remember and 2 pills the next day. 



 2.         Then take 1 pill a day until you finish the pack.



 3.         You COULD GET PREGNANT if you have sex in the   7 days   after you miss pills. You MUST use another birth control method (such as condoms or foam) as a back-up method of birth control until you have taken a yellow "active" pill every day for 7 days.



 If you   MISS     2   yellow "active" pills in a row in   THE     3rd     WEEK:

 THROW OUT the rest of the pill pack and start a new pack that same day.



   If     you     are     a     Sunday     Starter:  



 Keep taking 1 pill every day until-Sunday. On Sunday, THROW OUT the rest of the pack and start a new pack of pills that same day.



 2.         You may not have your period this month, but this is expected. However, if you miss your period 2 months in a row, call your doctor or clinic because you might be pregnant.



 3.         You COULD GET PREGNANT if you have sex in the   7 days   after you miss pills. You MUST use another birth control method (such as condoms or foam) as a back-up method of birth control until you have taken a yellow "active" pill every day for 7 days.



 If you   MISS     3     OR     MORE   yellow "active" pills in a row (during the first 3 weeks):



 1.           If     you     are     a     Day-1     Starter:

 A REMINDER FOR THOSE ON 28-DAY PACKS:                                                                  
       IF YOU FORGET ANY OF THE 7 BROWN "REMINDER" PILLS IN WEEK 4:
 

 THROW AWAY THE PILLS YOU MISSED.



 KEEP TAKING 1 PILL EACH DAY UNTIL THE PACK IS EMPTY.



 YOU DO NOT NEED A BACK-UP METHOD.




 FINALLY, IF YOU ARE STILL NOT SURE WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE PILLS YOU HAVE MISSED:                         
       Use a BACK-UP METHOD anytime you have sex.
 

 KEEP TAKING ONE YELLOW "ACTIVE" PILL EACH DAY until you can reach your doctor or clinic.



   PREGNANCY DUE TO PILL FAILURE

  The incidence of pill failure resulting in pregnancy is approximately 1% (i.e., one pregnancy per 100 women per year) if taken every day as directed, but more typical failure rates are about 3%. If failure does occur, the risk to the fetus is minimal.



   PREGNANCY AFTER STOPPING THE PILL

  There may be some delay in becoming pregnant after you stop using oral contraceptives, especially if you had irregular menstrual cycles before you used oral contraceptives. It may be advisable to postpone conception until you begin menstruating regularly once you have stopped taking the pill and desire pregnancy. 



 There does not appear to be any increase in birth defects in newborn babies when pregnancy occurs soon after stopping the pill. 



   OVERDOSAGE

  Serious ill effects have not been reported following ingestion of large doses of oral contraceptives by young children. Overdosage may cause nausea and withdrawal bleeding in females. In case of overdosage, contact your healthcare provider or pharmacist.



   OTHER INFORMATION

  Your healthcare provider will take a medical and family history and examine you before prescribing oral contraceptives. The physical examination may be delayed to another time if you request it and your healthcare provider believes that it is a good medical practice to postpone it. You should be reexamined at least once a year. Be sure to inform your healthcare provider if there is a family history of any of the conditions listed previously in this leaflet. Be sure to keep all appointments with your healthcare provider, because this is a time to determine if there are early signs of side effects of oral contraceptive use. 



 Do not use the drug for any condition other than the one for which it was prescribed. This drug has been prescribed specifically for you; do not give it to others who may want birth control pills.



   HEALTH BENEFITS FROM ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES

  In addition to preventing pregnancy, use of oral contraceptives may provide certain benefits. They are:



 *  Menstrual cycles may become more regular 
 *  Blood flow during menstruation may be lighter and less iron may be lost. Therefore, anemia due to iron deficiency is less likely to occur 
 *  Pain or other symptoms during menstruation may be encountered less frequently 
 *  Ectopic (tubal) pregnancy may occur less frequently 
 *  Noncancerous cysts or lumps in the breast may occur less frequently 
 *  Acute pelvic inflammatory disease may occur less frequently 
 *  Oral contraceptive use may provide some protection against developing two forms of cancer: cancer of the ovaries and cancer of the lining of the uterus. 
    If you want more information about birth control pills, ask your doctor or pharmacist. They have a more technical leaflet called the "Physician Insert", which you may wish to read.
 

     Remembering         to         take         tablets         according         to         schedule         is         stressed         because         of         its         importance         in         providing         you         the         greatest         degree         of         protection.    



   MISSED MENSTRUAL PERIODS FOR BOTH DOSAGE REGIMENS

  At times there may be no menstrual period after a cycle of pills. Therefore, if you miss one menstrual period but have taken the pills   exactly     as     you     were     supposed     to  , continue as usual into the next cycle. If you have not taken the pills correctly and miss a menstrual period,   you     may     be     pregnant     and   should stop taking oral contraceptives until your doctor or healthcare provider determines whether or not you are pregnant. Until you can get to your doctor or healthcare provider, use another form of contraception. If two consecutive menstrual periods are missed, you should stop taking pills until it is determined whether or not you are pregnant. Although there does not appear to be any increase in birth defects in newborn babies if you become pregnant while using oral contraceptives, you should discuss the situation with your doctor or healthcare provider. 



   Periodic     Examination  



 Your doctor or healthcare provider will take a complete medical and family history before prescribing oral contraceptives. At that time and about once a year thereafter, he or she will generally examine your blood pressure, breasts, abdomen, and pelvic organs (including a Papanicolaou smear, i.e., test for cancer). 



   Keep     this     and     all     drugs     out     of     the     reach     of     children.

   1.            Patients should be counseled that this product does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases.



   2.            Physical Examination and Follow-Up



  It is good medical practice for all women to have annual history and physical examinations, including women using oral contraceptives. The physical examination, however, may be deferred until after initiation of oral contraceptives if requested by the woman and judged appropriate by the clinician. The physical examination should include special reference to blood pressure, breasts, abdomen and pelvic organs, including cervical cytology, and relevant laboratory tests. In case of undiagnosed, persistent or recurrent abnormal vaginal bleeding, appropriate measures should be conducted to rule out malignancy. Women with a strong family history of breast cancer or who have breast nodules should be monitored with particular care.



    3.            Lipid Disorders



  Women who are being treated for hyperlipidemia should be followed closely if they elect to use oral contraceptives. Some progestogens may elevate LDL levels and may render the control of hyperlipidemias more difficult.



    4.            Liver Function



  If jaundice develops in any woman receiving such drugs, the medication should be discontinued. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function.



    5.            Fluid Retention



  Oral contraceptives may cause some degree of fluid retention. They should be prescribed with caution, and only with careful monitoring, in patients with conditions which might be aggravated by fluid retention.



    6.            Emotional Disorders



  Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and the drug discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree.



    7.            Contact Lenses



  Contact lens wearers who develop visual changes or changes in lens tolerance should be assessed by an ophthalmologist.



    8.            Drug Interactions



    Effects       of       Other       Drugs       on       Oral       Contraceptives       (78)    



   Rifampin  :  Metabolism of both norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol is increased by rifampin. A reduction in contraceptive effectiveness and increased incidence of breakthrough bleeding and menstrual irregularities have been associated with concomitant use of rifampin.



   Anticonvulsants  :  Anticonvulsants such as phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine, have been shown to increase the metabolism of ethinyl estradiol and/or norethindrone, which could result in a reduction in contraceptive effectiveness.



   Troglitazone  :  Administration of troglitazone with an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone reduced the plasma concentrations of both by approximately 30%, which could result in a reduction in contraceptive effectiveness.



   Antibiotics  :  Pregnancy while taking oral contraceptives has been reported when the oral contraceptives were administered with antimicrobials such as ampicillin, tetracycline, and griseofulvin. However, clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not demonstrated any consistent effect of antibiotics (other than rifampin) on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids.



   Atorvastatin  :  Coadministration of atorvastatin and an oral contraceptive increased AUC values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol by approximately 30% and 20%, respectively.



   Concomitant Use with HCV Combination Therapy       - Liver Enzyme Elevation:    Do not co-administer [DRUG] with HCV drug combinations containing ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, due to potential for ALT elevations (see WARNINGS, RISK OF LIVER ENZYME ELEVATIONS WITH CONCOMITANT HEPATITIS C TREATMENT).  



   Other:    Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma ethinyl estradiol concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. A reduction in contraceptive effectiveness and increased incidence of breakthrough bleeding has been suggested with phenylbutazone.



   Effects       of       Oral       Contraceptives       on       Other       Drugs    



 Oral contraceptive combinations containing ethinyl estradiol may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. Increased plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, prednisolone, and theophylline have been reported with concomitant administration of oral contraceptives. In addition, oral contraceptives may induce the conjugation of other compounds. Decreased plasma concentrations of acetaminophen and increased clearance of temazepam, salicylic acid, morphine, and clofibric acid have been noted when these drugs were administered with oral contraceptives.



    9.           Interactions with Laboratory Tests



  Certain endocrine and liver function tests and blood components may be affected by oral contraceptives:



 *  Increased prothrombin and factors VII, VIII, IX, and X; decreased antithrombin 3; increased norepinephrine-induced platelet aggregability. 
 *  Increased thyroid binding globulin (TBG) leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone, as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4by column or by radioimmunoassay. Free T3resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG; free T4concentration is unaltered. 
 *  Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum. 
 *  Sex-binding globulins are increased and result in elevated levels of total circulating sex steroids and corticoids; however, free or biologically active levels remain unchanged. 
 *  Triglycerides may be increased. 
 *  Glucose tolerance may be decreased. 
 *  Serum folate levels may be depressed by oral contraceptive therapy. This may be of clinical significance if a woman becomes pregnant shortly after discontinuing oral contraceptives.

  See   WARNINGS    section.



    11.           Pregnancy



  Pregnancy Category X. See   CONTRAINDICATIONS    and   WARNINGS    sections.



    12.            Nursing Mothers



  Small amounts of oral contraceptive steroids have been identified in the milk of nursing mothers, and a few adverse effects on the child have been reported, including jaundice and breast enlargement. In addition, oral contraceptives, given in the postpartum period may interfere with lactation by decreasing the quantity and quality of breast milk. If possible, the nursing mother should be advised not to use oral contraceptives but to use other forms of contraception until she has completely weaned her child.



    13.           Pediatric Use



  Safety and efficacy of Blisovi Fe 1/20 have been established in women of reproductive age. Safety and efficacy are expected to be the same for postpubertal adolescents under the age of 16 and for users 16 years and older. Use of this product before menarche is not indicated.
