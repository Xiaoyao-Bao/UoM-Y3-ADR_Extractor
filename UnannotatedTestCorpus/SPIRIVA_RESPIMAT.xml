  The following adverse reactions are described, or described in greater detail, in other sections:



 *  Immediate hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )]  
 *  Paradoxical bronchospasm [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  )]  
 *  Worsening of narrow-angle glaucoma [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.4  )]  
 *  Worsening of urinary retention [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.5  )]  
    Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the incidence of adverse reactions observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the incidences in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the incidences observed in practice.
 

 Since the same active ingredient (tiotropium bromide) is administered to COPD and asthma patients, prescribers and patients should take into account that the observed adverse reactions could be relevant for both patient populations independent of dosage strength.



   EXCERPT:   The most common adverse reactions in:



 *  COPD: (&gt;3% incidence in the placebo-controlled trials with treatment durations of between 4 and 48 weeks) were pharyngitis, cough, dry mouth, and sinusitis (  6.1  ). 
 *  Asthma: (&gt;2% incidence in the placebo-controlled trials with treatment durations of between 12 and 52 weeks) were pharyngitis, headache, bronchitis, and sinusitis in adults (  6.2  ).

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease

  The SPIRIVA RESPIMAT clinical development program included ten placebo controlled clinical trials in COPD. Two trials were four-week cross-over trials and eight were parallel group trials. The parallel group trials included a three week dose-ranging trial, two 12-week trials, three 48-week trials, and two trials of 4-week and 24-week duration conducted for a different program that contained tiotropium bromide 5 mcg treatment arms. The primary safety database consists of pooled data from the 7 randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of 4-48 weeks in treatment duration. These trials included 6565 adult COPD patients (75% males and 25% females) 40 years of age and older. Of these patients, 3282 patients were treated with SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 5 mcg and 3283 received placebo. The SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 5 mcg group was composed mostly of Caucasians (78%) with a mean age of 65 years and a mean baseline percent predicted post-bronchodilator FEV1of 46%.



 In these 7 clinical trials, 68.3% of patients exposed to SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 5 mcg reported an adverse event compared to 68.7% of patients in the placebo group. There were 68 deaths in the SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 5 mcg treatment group (2.1%) and 52 deaths (1.6%) in patients who received placebo  [see Clinical Studies (  14  ) Long-term active controlled mortality trial: Survival]  . The percentage of SPIRIVA RESPIMAT patients who discontinued due to an adverse event were 7.3% compared to 10% with placebo patients. The percentage of SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 5 mcg patients who experienced a serious adverse event were 15.0% compared to 15.1% with placebo patients. In both groups, the adverse event most commonly leading to discontinuation was COPD exacerbation (SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 2.0%, placebo 4.0%) which was also the most frequent serious adverse event. The most commonly reported adverse reactions were pharyngitis, cough, dry mouth, and sinusitis (Table 1). Other adverse reactions reported in individual patients and consistent with possible anticholinergic effects included constipation, dysuria, and urinary retention.

   6.2 Clinical Trials Experience in Asthma

    Adult Patients  SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 2.5 mcg has been compared to placebo in four placebo-controlled parallel-group trials ranging from 12 to 52 weeks of treatment duration in adult patients (aged 18 to 75 years) with asthma. The safety data described below are based on one 1-year, two 6-month and one 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in a total of 2849 asthma patients on background treatment of at least ICS or ICS and long-acting beta agonist (ICS/LABA). Of these patients, 787 were treated with SPIRIVA RESPIMAT at the recommended dose of 2.5 mcg once-daily; 59.7% were female and 47.5% were Caucasian with a mean age of 43.7 years and a mean post-bronchodilator percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of 90.0% at baseline.

   Less Common Adverse Reactions  Among the adverse reactions observed in the clinical trials with an incidence of 0.5% to &lt;1% and at a higher incidence rate on SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 2.5 mcg than on placebo were: palpitations, dysphonia, acute tonsillitis, tonsillitis, rhinitis, herpes zoster, gastroesophageal reflux disease, oropharyngeal discomfort, abdominal pain upper, insomnia, hypersensitivity (including immediate reactions), angioedema, dehydration, arthralgia, muscle spasms, pain in extremity, chest pain, hepatic function abnormal, liver function test abnormal.



   Adolescent Patients Aged 12 to 17 years  SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 2.5 mcg has been compared to placebo in two placebo-controlled parallel-group trials ranging from 12 to 48 weeks of treatment duration in adolescent patients with asthma. The safety data described below are based on one 48-week and one 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in a total of 789 adolescent asthma patients on background treatment of at least ICS or ICS plus one or more controller. Of these patients, 252 were treated with SPIRIVA RESPIMAT at the recommended dose of 2.5 mcg once-daily; 63.9% were male and 95.6% were Caucasian with a mean age of 14.3 years and a mean post-bronchodilator percent predicted FEV1of 98.3% at baseline. The adverse reaction profile for adolescent patients with asthma was comparable to that observed in adult patients with asthma.



   Pediatric Patients Aged 6 to 11 years  SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 2.5 mcg has been compared to placebo in two placebo-controlled parallel-group trials ranging from 12 to 48 weeks of treatment duration in pediatric patients aged 6 to 11 years with asthma. The safety data are based on one 48-week and one 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in a total of 801 pediatric asthma patients aged 6 to 11 years on background treatment of at least ICS or ICS plus one or more controller. Of these patients, 271 were treated with SPIRIVA RESPIMAT at the recommended dose of 2.5 mcg once-daily; 71.2% were male and 86.7% were Caucasian with a mean age of 8.9 years and a mean post-bronchodilator percent predicted FEV1of 97.9% at baseline. The adverse reaction profile for pediatric patients aged 6 to 11 years with asthma was comparable to that observed in adult patients with asthma.



 SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 5 mcg also has been compared to placebo in seven placebo-controlled parallel-group trials ranging from 12 to 52 weeks of treatment duration in 4149 adult patients (aged 18 to 75 years) with asthma and in two placebo-controlled parallel-group trials ranging from 12 to 48 weeks of treatment duration in 789 adolescent patients (1370 adults and 264 adolescents receiving SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 5 mcg once-daily). The adverse reaction profile for SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 5 mcg in patients with asthma was comparable to that observed with SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 2.5 mcg in patients with asthma.



   6.3 Postmarketing Experience

  In addition to the adverse reactions observed during the SPIRIVA RESPIMAT clinical trials in COPD, the following adverse reactions have been observed during post-approval use of SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 5 mcg and another tiotropium formulation, SPIRIVA  (r)  HandiHaler  (r)  (tiotropium bromide inhalation powder). Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 *  Glaucoma, intraocular pressure increased, vision blurred, 
 *  Atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, 
 *  Bronchospasm, 
 *  Glossitis, stomatitis, 
 *  Dehydration, 
 *  Insomnia, 
 *  Hypersensitivity (including immediate reactions), and urticaria.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Not for acute use, i.e., not a rescue medication (  5.1  ) 
 *  Immediate hypersensitivity reactions: Discontinue SPIRIVA RESPIMAT at once and consider alternatives if immediate hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, urticaria, rash, bronchospasm, or anaphylaxis, occur. (  5.2  ) 
 *  Paradoxical bronchospasm: Discontinue SPIRIVA RESPIMAT and consider other treatments if paradoxical bronchospasm occurs. (  5.3  ) 
 *  Worsening of narrow-angle glaucoma may occur. Use with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma and instruct patients to consult a physician immediately if this occurs. (  5.4  ) 
 *  Worsening of urinary retention may occur. Use with caution in patients with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction and instruct patient to consult a physician immediately if this occurs. (  5.5  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Not for Acute Use



  SPIRIVA RESPIMAT is intended as a once-daily maintenance treatment for COPD and asthma and should not be used for the relief of acute symptoms, i.e., as rescue therapy for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm. In the event of an acute attack, a rapid-acting beta2-agonist should be used.



    5.2 Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions



  Immediate hypersensitivity reactions, including urticaria, angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue or throat), rash, bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, or itching may occur after administration of SPIRIVA RESPIMAT. If such a reaction occurs, therapy with SPIRIVA RESPIMAT should be stopped at once and alternative treatments should be considered. Given the similar structural formula of atropine to tiotropium, patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions to atropine or its derivatives should be closely monitored for similar hypersensitivity reactions to SPIRIVA RESPIMAT.



    5.3 Paradoxical Bronchospasm



  Inhaled medicines, including SPIRIVA RESPIMAT, may cause paradoxical bronchospasm. If this occurs, it should be treated immediately with an inhaled short-acting beta2-agonist such as albuterol. Treatment with SPIRIVA RESPIMAT should be stopped and other treatments considered.



    5.4 Worsening of Narrow-Angle Glaucoma



  SPIRIVA RESPIMAT should be used with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma. Prescribers and patients should be alert for signs and symptoms of acute narrow-angle glaucoma (e.g., eye pain or discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion and corneal edema). Instruct patients to consult a physician immediately should any of these signs or symptoms develop.



    5.5 Worsening of Urinary Retention



  SPIRIVA RESPIMAT should be used with caution in patients with urinary retention. Prescribers and patients should be alert for signs and symptoms of urinary retention (e.g., difficulty passing urine, painful urination), especially in patients with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction. Instruct patients to consult a physician immediately should any of these signs or symptoms develop.



    5.6 Renal Impairment



  As a predominantly renally excreted drug, patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of &lt;60 mL/min) treated with SPIRIVA RESPIMAT should be monitored closely for anticholinergic side effects [see Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )]  .
