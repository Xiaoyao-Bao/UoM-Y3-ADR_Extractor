  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The data described below reflect exposure of 80 patients with type 1 Gaucher disease in two open-label, uncontrolled, monotherapy trials, one open-label, active-controlled trial, and two extensions, who received Zavesca at doses ranging from 50mg to 200 mg three times daily. Patients were aged 18 to 69 years at first treatment. The population was evenly distributed by gender.



 The most common serious adverse reaction reported with Zavesca treatment in clinical trials was peripheral neuropathy  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ].  



 The most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients treated with Zavesca (occuring in &gt;=5%) that were considered related to Zavesca are shown in Tables 1 and 2.  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2  ,  5.3  )].  



 The most common adverse reactions requiring intervention were diarrhea and tremor.  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2  ,  5.3  )].  



 In two open-label, uncontrolled monotherapy trials, adult type 1 Gaucher disease patients were treated with Zavesca at a starting dose of 100 mg three times daily (dose range 100 to 200 mg three times daily) for up to 12 months in 28 patients [Study 1], or at a dose of 50 mg three times daily for up to 6 months in 18 patients [Study 2]. Table 1 below lists adverse reactions that occurred during the trials in &gt;=5% of patients.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



  Therapy should be directed by physicians knowledgeable in the management of patients with Gaucher disease.



    EXCERPT:    *   Peripheral neuropathy : Perform baseline and follow-up neurological evaluations at 6 month intervals in all patients (  5.1  ). 
 *   Tremor or exacerbation of existing tremors : Reduce dose to ameliorate tremor or discontinue treatment if tremor does not resolve within days of dose reduction (  5.2  ). 
 *   Diarrhea and weight loss : Evaluate for underlying gastrointestinal disease in patients who do not respond to usual interventions (e.g. diet modification) (  5.3  ). 
    
 

   5.1 Peripheral Neuropathy



  In clinical trials, cases of peripheral neuropathy have been reported in 3% of Gaucher's patients treated with Zavesca. All patients receiving Zavesca treatment should undergo baseline and repeat neurological evaluations at approximately 6-month intervals. Patients who develop symptoms of peripheral neuropathy such as pain, weakness, numbness and tingling should have a careful re-assessment of the risk/benefit of Zavesca therapy, and cessation of treatment may be considered.



    5.2 Tremor



  Approximately 30% of patients have reported tremor or exacerbation of existing tremor on treatment. These tremors were described as an exaggerated physiological tremor of the hands. Tremor usually began within the first month of therapy and in many cases resolved between 1 to 3 months during treatment. Reduce dose to ameliorate tremor or discontinue treatment if tremor does not resolve within days of dose reduction.



    5.3 Diarrhea and Weight Loss



  Diarrhea and weight loss were common in clinical studies of patients treated with Zavesca, occurring in approximately 85% and up to 65% of treated patients, respectively. Diarrhea appears to be the result of the inhibitory activity of Zavesca on intestinal disaccharidases such as sucrase-isomaltase in the gastrointestinal tract leading to reduced absorption of dietary disaccharides in the small intestine, with a resultant osmotic diarrhea. It is unclear if weight loss results from the diarrhea and associated gastrointestinal complaints, a decrease in food intake, or a combination of these or other factors. The incidence of weight loss was most evident in the first 12 months of treatment. Diarrhea decreased over time with continued Zavesca treatment, and may respond to individualized diet modification (e.g., reduction of sucrose, lactose and other carbohydrate intake), to taking Zavesca between meals, and/or to anti-diarrheal medications, most commonly loperamide. Patients may be instructed to avoid high carbohydrate content foods during treatment with Zavesca if they present with diarrhea.



 Patients with persistent gastrointestinal events that continue during treatment with Zavesca, and who do not respond to usual interventions (e.g. diet modification), should be evaluated to determine whether significant underlying gastrointestinal disease is present. The safety of treatment with Zavesca has not been evaluated in patients with significant gastrointestinal disease, such as inflammatory bowel disease, and continued treatment of these patients with Zavesca should occur only after consideration of the risks and benefits of continued treatment.



    5.4 Reductions in Platelet Count



  In clinical trials evaluating the use of Zavesca for treatment of indications other than type 1 Gaucher disease, mild reductions in platelet counts without association with bleeding were observed in some patients; approximately 40% of patients in this trial had low platelet counts (defined as below 150 * 10  9  /L) before starting treatment with Zavesca. Monitoring of platelet counts is recommended in patients with type 1 Gaucher disease. Mild reductions in platelet counts without association with bleeding were observed in patients with type 1 Gaucher disease who were switched from enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) to Zavesca.
