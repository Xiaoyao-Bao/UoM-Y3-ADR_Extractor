          The intensity of the reported adverse experiences following the administration of Nascobal (Cyanocobalamin, USP) Gel for Intranasal Administration and intramuscular vitamin B12were generally mild. One patient reported severe headache following intramuscular dosing. Similarly, a few adverse experiences of moderate intensity were reported following intramuscular dosing (two headaches and rhinitis; one dyspepsia, arthritis, and dizziness), and dosing with Nascobal (Cyanocobalamin, USP) Gel for Intranasal Administration (one headache, infection, and paresthesia).
 

 The majority of the reported adverse experiences following dosing with Nascobal (Cyanocobalamin, USP) Gel for Intranasal Administration and intramuscular vitamin B12were judged to be intercurrent events. For the other reported adverse experiences, the relationship to study drug was judged as "possible" or "remote". Of the adverse experiences judged to be of "possible" relationship to the study drug, anxiety, incoordination, and nervousness were reported following intramuscular vitamin B12and headache, nausea, and rhinitis were reported following dosing with Nascobal (Cyanocobalamin, USP) Gel for Intranasal Administration.



 The following adverse reactions have been reported with parenteral vitamin B12:



 Cardiovascular: Pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure early in treatment; peripheral vascular thrombosis.



 Hematological: Polycythemia vera.



 Gastrointestinal: Mild transient diarrhea.



 Dermatological: Itching; transitory exanthema.



 Miscellaneous: Feeling of swelling of the entire body.

   1. GENERAL



  An intradermal test dose of parenteral vitamin B12is recommended before Nascobal Nasal Spray is administered to patients suspected of cyanocobalamin sensitivity. Vitamin B12deficiency that is allowed to progress for longer than three months may produce permanent degenerative lesions of the spinal cord. Doses of folic acid greater than 0.1 mg per day may result in hematologic remission in patients with vitamin B12deficiency. Neurologic manifestations will not be prevented with folic acid, and if not treated with vitamin B12, irreversible damage will result.



 Doses of vitamin B12exceeding 10 mcg daily may produce hematologic response in patients with folate deficiency. Indiscriminate administration may mask the true diagnosis.



 The validity of diagnostic vitamin B12or folic acid blood assays could be compromised by medications, and this should be considered before relying on such tests for therapy.



 Vitamin B12is not a substitute for folic acid and since it might improve folic acid deficient megaloblastic anemia, indiscriminate use of vitamin B12could mask the true diagnosis.



 Hypokalemia and thrombocytosis could occur upon conversion of severe megaloblastic to normal erythropoiesis with vitamin B12therapy. Therefore, serum potassium levels and the platelet count should be monitored carefully during therapy.



 Vitamin B12deficiency may suppress the signs of polycythemia vera. Treatment with vitamin B12may unmask this condition.



 If a patient is not properly maintained with Nascobal  (r)  Nasal Spray, intramuscular vitamin B12is necessary for adequate treatment of the patient. No single regimen fits all cases, and the status of the patient observed in follow-up is the final criterion for adequacy of therapy.



 The effectiveness of Nascobal Nasal Spray in patients with nasal congestion, allergic rhinitis and upper respiratory infections has not been determined. Therefore, treatment with Nascobal Nasal Spray should be deferred until symptoms have subsided.



    2. INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS



  Patients with pernicious anemia should be instructed that they will require weekly intranasal administration of Nascobal Nasal Spray for the remainder of their lives. Failure to do so will result in return of the anemia and in development of incapacitating and irreversible damage to the nerves of the spinal cord. Also, patients should be warned about the danger of taking folic acid in place of vitamin B12, because the former may prevent anemia but allow progression of subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord.



 (Hot foods may cause nasal secretions and a resulting loss of medication; therefore, patients should be told to administer Nascobal Nasal Spray at least one hour before or one hour after ingestion of hot foods or liquids.)



 A vegetarian diet which contains no animal products (including milk products or eggs) does not supply any vitamin B12. Therefore, patients following such a diet should be advised to take Nascobal Nasal Spray weekly. The need for vitamin B12is increased by pregnancy and lactation. Deficiency has been recognized in infants of vegetarian mothers who were breast fed, even though the mothers had no symptoms of deficiency at the time.



 Because the nasal dosage forms of vitamin B12have a lower absorption than intramuscular dosage, nasal dosage forms are administered weekly, rather than the monthly intramuscular dosage. As shown in the Figure above, at the end of a month, weekly nasal administration results in significantly higher serum vitamin B12levels than after intramuscular administration. The patient should also understand the importance of returning for follow-up blood tests every 3 to 6 months to confirm adequacy of the therapy.



 Careful instructions on the actuator assembly, removal of the safety clip, priming of the actuator and nasal administration of Nascobal Nasal Spray should be given to the patient. Although instructions for patients are supplied with individual bottles, procedures for use should be demonstrated to each patient.



    3. LABORATORY TESTS



  Hematocrit, reticulocyte count, vitamin B12, folate and iron levels should be obtained prior to treatment. If folate levels are low, folic acid should also be administered. All hematologic parameters should be normal when beginning treatment with Nascobal  (r)  Nasal Spray.



 Vitamin B12blood levels and peripheral blood counts must be monitored initially at one month after the start of treatment with Nascobal  (r)  Nasal Spray, and then at intervals of 3 to 6 months.



 A decline in the serum levels of B12after one month of treatment with B12nasal spray may indicate that the dose may need to be adjusted upward. Patients should be seen one month after each dose adjustment; continued low levels of serum B12may indicate that the patient is not a candidate for this mode of administration.



 Patients with pernicious anemia have about 3 times the incidence of carcinoma of the stomach as in the general population, so appropriate tests for this condition should be carried out when indicated.



    4. DRUG/LABORATORY TEST INTERACTIONS



  Persons taking most antibiotics, methotrexate or pyrimethamine invalidate folic acid and vitamin B12diagnostic blood assays.



 Colchicine, para-aminosalicylic acid and heavy alcohol intake for longer than 2 weeks may produce malabsorption of vitamin B12.



    5. CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY



  Long-term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential have not been done. There is no evidence from long-term use in patients with pernicious anemia that vitamin B12is carcinogenic. Pernicious anemia is associated with an increased incidence of carcinoma of the stomach, but this is believed to be related to the underlying pathology and not to treatment with vitamin B12.



    6. PREGNANCY



  Pregnancy Category C: Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with vitamin B12. It is also not known whether vitamin B12can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Adequate and well-controlled studies have not been done in pregnant women. However, vitamin B12is an essential vitamin and requirements are increased during pregnancy. Amounts of vitamin B12that are recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science - National Research Council for pregnant women should be consumed during pregnancy.



    7. NURSING MOTHERS



  Vitamin B12appears in the milk of nursing mothers in concentrations which approximate the mother's vitamin B12blood level. Amounts of vitamin B12that are recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council for lactating women should be consumed during lactation.



    8. PEDIATRIC USE



  Intake in pediatric patients should be in the amount recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council.

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings">    WARNINGS



  Patients with early Leber's disease (hereditary optic nerve atrophy) who were treated with vitamin B12suffered severe and swift optic atrophy.



 Hypokalemia and sudden death may occur in severe megaloblastic anemia which is treated intensely with vitamin B12. Folic acid is not a substitute for vitamin B12although it may improve vitamin B12-deficient megaloblastic anemia. Exclusive use of folic acid in treating vitamin B12-deficient megaloblastic anemia could result in progressive and irreversible neurologic damage.



 Anaphylactic shock and death have been reported after parenteral vitamin B12administration. No such reactions have been reported in clinical trials with Nascobal Nasal Spray or Nascobal Nasal Gel.



 Blunted or impeded therapeutic response to vitamin B12may be due to such conditions as infection, uremia, drugs having bone marrow suppressant properties such as chloramphenicol, and concurrent iron or folic acid deficiency.
