  6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 Two clinical trials with BASAGLAR were conducted: one in type 1 diabetes and one in type 2 diabetes.



 The type 1 diabetes population had the following characteristics: Mean age was 41 years and mean duration of diabetes was 16 years. 58% were male. 75% were Caucasian, 2% Black or African American and 4% American Indian or Alaskan native. 4% were Hispanic. At baseline, mean eGFR was 109 mL/min/1.73m  2  . 73.5 percent of patients had eGFR&gt;90 mL/min/1.73m  2  . The mean BMI was approximately 26 kg/m  2  . HbA1cat baseline was 7.8%. The data in  Table 1  reflect exposure of 268 patients to BASAGLAR with a mean exposure duration of 49 weeks.



 The type 2 diabetes population had the following characteristics: Mean age was 59 years and mean duration of diabetes was 11 years. 50% were male. 78% were Caucasian, 8% Black or African American and 5% American Indian or Alaskan native. 28% were Hispanic. At baseline, mean eGFR was 109 mL/min/1.73m  2  . 67.5 percent of patients had eGFR&gt;90 mL/min/1.73m  2  . The mean BMI was approximately 32 kg/m  2  . HbA1cat baseline was 8.3%. The data in  Table 2  reflect exposure of 376 patients to BASAGLAR with a mean exposure duration of 22 weeks.



 Common adverse reactions were defined as reactions occurring in &gt;=5% of the population studied. Common adverse reactions during clinical trials in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus (other than hypoglycemia) are listed in  Table 1  and  Table 2  , respectively.

             Severe Hypoglycemia  
 

 Hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients using insulin, including BASAGLAR  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  )]  . The rates of reported hypoglycemia depend on the definition of hypoglycemia used, diabetes type, insulin dose, intensity of glucose control, background therapies, and other intrinsic and extrinsic patient factors. For these reasons, comparing rates of hypoglycemia in clinical trials for BASAGLAR with the incidence of hypoglycemia for other products may be misleading and also, may not be representative of hypoglycemia rates that will occur in clinical practice.



 Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was defined as an event with symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person and associated with either a blood glucose below 50 mg/dL (&lt;=56 mg/dL in the 5-year trial and &lt;=36 mg/dL in the ORIGIN trial) or prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose or glucagon administration.



 The incidence of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in patients receiving BASAGLAR with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus  [see Clinical Studies (  14  )]  was 4% at 52 weeks and 1% at 24 weeks, respectively.



 The incidence of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in a clinical trial with another insulin glargine product, 100 units/mL, in children and adolescents age 6 to 15 years with type 1 diabetes  [see Clinical Studies (  14  )]  was 23% at 26 weeks.



   Table 5  displays the proportion of patients experiencing severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in another insulin glargine product, 100 units/mL, and Standard Care groups in the ORIGIN Trial  [see Clinical Studies (  14  )]  .

 Percent of patients       6                                      2                                        
             Allergic Reactions  
 

 Some patients taking insulin therapy, including BASAGLAR have experienced erythema, local edema, and pruritus at the site of injection. These conditions were usually self-limiting. Severe cases of generalized allergy (anaphylaxis) have been reported  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.5  )]  .



     Peripheral Edema  



 Some patients taking BASAGLAR have experienced sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy.



     Lipodystrophy  



 Administration of insulin subcutaneously, including BASAGLAR, has resulted in lipoatrophy (depression in the skin) or lipohypertrophy (enlargement or thickening of tissue) in some patients  [see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  )]  .



     Weight gain  



 Weight gain has occurred with some insulin therapies including BASAGLAR and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glycosuria.



   6.2 Immunogenicity

  As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity.



 In a 52-week study of type 1 diabetes patients, 42% of patients who received BASAGLAR once daily were positive for anti-drug antibodies (ADA) at least once during the study, including 17% that were positive at baseline and 25% of patients who developed ADA during the study. Sixty-five percent of the ADA positive patients on BASAGLAR with antibody testing at week 52 remained ADA positive at week 52.



 In a 24-week study of type 2 diabetes patients, 17% of patients who received BASAGLAR once daily were positive for ADA at least once during the study. Among the subjects who were positive, 5% had ADA at baseline and 12% developed antibodies during the study. The percent binding of patients positive at baseline on BASAGLAR did not increase significantly during the study. Fifty-one percent of the ADA positive patients on BASAGLAR with antibody testing at week 24 remained ADA positive at week 24. There was no evidence that these antibodies had an impact on efficacy and safety outcomes.



 The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay and may be influenced by several factors such as: assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medication, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to BASAGLAR with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading.



   6.3 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of another insulin glargine product, 100 units/mL.



 Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 Medication errors have been reported in which other insulin products, particularly rapid-acting insulins, have been accidentally administered instead of an insulin glargine product. To avoid medication errors between insulin glargine products and other insulin products, patients should be instructed to always verify the insulin label before each injection.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *   Never share a BASAGLAR KwikPen between patients, even if the needle is changed. (  5.1  ) 
 *   Hyper- or hypoglycemia with changes in insulin regimen: Carry out under close medical supervision. (  5.2  ) 
 *   Hypoglycemia: May be life-threatening. Increase frequency of glucose monitoring with changes to: insulin dosage, co-administered glucose lowering medications, meal pattern, physical activity; and in patients with renal or hepatic impairment and hypoglycemia unawareness. (  5.3  ,  6.1  ) 
 *   Medication Errors: Accidental mix-ups between insulin products can occur. Instruct patients to check insulin labels before injection. (  5.4  ) 
 *   Hypersensitivity reactions: Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur. Discontinue BASAGLAR, monitor and treat if indicated. (  5.5  ,  6.1  ) 
 *   Hypokalemia: May be life-threatening. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk of hypokalemia and treat if indicated. (  5.6  ) 
 *   Fluid retention and heart failure with concomitant use of thiazolidinediones (TZDs): Observe for signs and symptoms of heart failure; consider dosage reduction or discontinuation if heart failure occurs. (  5.7  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Never Share a BASAGLAR KwikPen Between Patients



  BASAGLAR KwikPens must never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens.



    5.2 Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen



  Changes in insulin strength, manufacturer, type, or method of administration may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  )]  or hyperglycemia. These changes should be made cautiously and only under close medical supervision, and the frequency of blood glucose monitoring should be increased. For patients with type 2 diabetes, dosage adjustments of concomitant anti-diabetic products may be needed.



    5.3 Hypoglycemia



  Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction associated with insulins, including BASAGLAR [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may be life-threatening or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place an individual and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g., driving or operating other machinery). BASAGLAR, or any insulin, should not be used during episodes of hypoglycemia [see Contraindications (  4  )]  .



 Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over time in the same individual. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes, in patients with diabetic nerve disease, in patients using medications that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers) [see Drug Interactions (  7  )]  , or in patients who experience recurrent hypoglycemia.



    Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia  



 The risk of hypoglycemia after an injection is related to the duration of action of the insulin and, in general, is highest when the glucose lowering effect of the insulin is maximal. As with all insulin preparations, the glucose lowering effect time course of BASAGLAR may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature [see Clinical Pharmacology (  12.2  )]  . The risk of hypoglycemia generally increases with intensity of glycemic control. Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to co-administered medication [see Drug Interactions (  7  )]  . Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.6  ,  8.7  )]  .



    Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia  



 Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended.



 The long-acting effect of BASAGLAR may delay recovery from hypoglycemia.



    5.4 Medication Errors



  Accidental mix-ups between insulin glargine product, 100 units/mL, and other insulins, particularly rapid-acting insulins, have been reported. To avoid medication errors between BASAGLAR and other insulins, instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection.



    5.5 Hypersensitivity and Allergic Reactions



  Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulin products, including BASAGLAR. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue BASAGLAR; treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . BASAGLAR is contraindicated in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to insulin glargine or one of the excipients [see Contraindications (  4  )]  .



    5.6 Hypokalemia



  All insulin products, including BASAGLAR, cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia if indicated (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentrations).



    5.7 Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of PPAR-gamma Agonists



  Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including BASAGLAR, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered.
