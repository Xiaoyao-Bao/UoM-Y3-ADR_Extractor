  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



     Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC)  



 The adverse reactions described in  Table 2  were identified in 804 patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer treated in CLEOPATRA. Patients were randomized to receive either PERJETA in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel or placebo in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel. The median duration of study treatment was 18.1 months for patients in the PERJETA-treated group and 11.8 months for patients in the placebo-treated group. No dose adjustment was permitted for PERJETA or trastuzumab. Adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of all study therapy were 6% in the PERJETA-treated group and 5% for patients in the placebo-treated group. The most common adverse reactions (&gt;1%) that led to discontinuation of all study therapy was left ventricular dysfunction (1% for patients in the PERJETA-treated group and 2% for patients in the placebo-treated group). The most common adverse reactions that led to discontinuation of docetaxel alone were edema, fatigue, edema peripheral, neuropathy peripheral, neutropenia, nail disorder and pleural effusion.  Table 2  reports the adverse reactions that occurred in at least 10% of patients in the PERJETA-treated group. The safety profile of PERJETA remained unchanged with an additional 2.75 years of follow-up (median total follow-up of 50 months) in CLEOPATRA.



 The most common adverse reactions (&gt; 30%) seen with PERJETA in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel were diarrhea, alopecia, neutropenia, nausea, fatigue, rash, and peripheral neuropathy. The most common NCI - CTCAE v3.0 Grade 3 - 4 adverse reactions (&gt; 2%) were neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, leukopenia, diarrhea, peripheral neuropathy, anemia, asthenia, and fatigue. An increased incidence of febrile neutropenia was observed for Asian patients in both treatment arms compared with patients of other races and from other geographic regions. Among Asian patients, the incidence of febrile neutropenia was higher in the pertuzumab-treated group (26%) compared with the placebo-treated group (12%).

             The following clinically relevant adverse reactions were reported in &lt; 10% of patients in the PERJETA-treated group in CLEOPATRA:  
 

   Infections and infestations:  Paronychia (7% in the PERJETA-treated group vs. 4% in the placebo-treated group)



     Adverse Reactions Reported in Patients Receiving PERJETA and Trastuzumab After Discontinuation of Docetaxel  



 In CLEOPATRA, adverse reactions were reported less frequently after discontinuation of docetaxel treatment. All adverse reactions in the PERJETA and trastuzumab treatment group occurred in &lt; 10% of patients with the exception of diarrhea (19%), upper respiratory tract infection (13%), rash (12%), headache (11%), and fatigue (11%).



     Neoadjuvant Treatment of Breast Cancer (NeoSphere)  



 In NeoSphere, the most common adverse reactions seen with PERJETA in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel administered for 4 cycles were similar to those seen in the PERJETA-treated group in CLEOPATRA. The most common adverse reactions (&gt; 30%) were alopecia, neutropenia, diarrhea, and nausea. The most common NCI - CTCAE v3.0 Grade 3 - 4 adverse reactions (&gt; 2%) were neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, leukopenia, and diarrhea. In this group, one patient permanently discontinued neoadjuvant treatment due to an adverse event.  Table 3  reports the adverse reactions that occurred in patients who received neoadjuvant treatment with PERJETA for breast cancer in NeoSphere.

                 The following adverse reactions were reported in &lt; 10% of patients receiving neoadjuvant treatment and occurred more frequently in PERJETA-treated groups in NeoSphere: (Ptz=pertuzumab; H=trastuzumab; D=docetaxel)  
 

   Blood and lymphatic system disorders:  Anemia (7% in the H+D arm, 3% in the Ptz+H+D arm, 5% in the Ptz+H arm and 9% in the Ptz+D arm), Febrile neutropenia (7% in the H+D arm, 8% in the Ptz+H+D arm, 0% in the Ptz+H arm and 7% in the Ptz+D arm)



   Nervous system disorders:  Dizziness (4% in the H+D arm, 3% in the Ptz+H+D arm, 6% in the Ptz+H arm and 3% in the Ptz+D arm)



   Infections and infestations:  Upper respiratory tract infection (3% in the H+D arm, 5% in the Ptz+H+D arm, 2% in the Ptz+H arm and 7% in the Ptz+D arm)



   Eye disorders:  Lacrimation increased (2% in the H+D arm, 4% in the Ptz+H+D arm, 0.9% in the Ptz+H arm, and 4% in the Ptz+D arm)



     Neoadjuvant Treatment of Breast Cancer (TRYPHAENA)  



 In TRYPHAENA, when PERJETA was administered in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel for 3 cycles following 3 cycles of FEC, the most common adverse reactions (&gt; 30%) were diarrhea, nausea, alopecia, neutropenia, vomiting, and fatigue. The most common NCI-CTCAE (version 3) Grade 3 - 4 adverse reactions (&gt; 2%) were neutropenia, leukopenia, febrile neutropenia, diarrhea, left ventricular dysfunction, anemia, dyspnea, nausea, and vomiting.



 Similarly, when PERJETA was administered in combination with docetaxel, carboplatin, and trastuzumab (TCH) for 6 cycles, the most common adverse reactions (&gt; 30%) were diarrhea, alopecia, neutropenia, nausea, fatigue, vomiting, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The most common NCI-CTCAE (version 3) Grade 3 - 4 adverse reactions (&gt; 2%) were neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, anemia, leukopenia, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, fatigue, ALT increased, hypokalemia, and hypersensitivity.



 Adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of any component of neoadjuvant treatment occurred in 7% of patients receiving PERJETA in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel following FEC, and 8% for patients receiving PERJETA in combination with TCH. The most common adverse reactions (&gt;2%) resulting in permanent discontinuation of PERJETA were left ventricular dysfunction, drug hypersensitivity, and neutropenia.  Table 4  reports the adverse reactions that occurred in patients who received neoadjuvant treatment with PERJETA for breast cancer in TRYPHAENA.

             The following selected adverse reactions were reported in &lt; 10% of patients receiving neoadjuvant treatment in BERENICE: (Ptz=pertuzumab; H=trastuzumab; P=paclitaxel; ddAC=dose-dense doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide; D=docetaxel; FEC= fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide)  
 

   Skin and Subcutaneous tissue disorders:  Pruritus (9% in the ddAC/Ptz+H+P arm, and 8% in the FEC/Ptz+H+D arm), Nail disorder (7% in the ddAC/Ptz+H+P arm, and 10% in the FEC/Ptz+H+D arm)



   Infections and infestations:  Upper respiratory tract infection (7% in the ddAC/Ptz+H+P arm, and 2% in the FEC/Ptz+H+D arm), nasopharyngitis (7% in the ddAC/Ptz+H+P arm, and 9% in the FEC/Ptz+H+D arm), paronychia (0.5% in the ddAC/Ptz+H+P arm, and 1% in the FEC/Ptz+H+D arm)



     Adjuvant Treatment of Breast Cancer (APHINITY)  



 The adverse reactions described in  Table 6  were identified in 4769 patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer treated in APHINITY. Patients were randomized to receive either PERJETA in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy or placebo in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy.



 Adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of any study therapy were 13% for patients in the PERJETA-treated group and 12% for patients in the placebo-treated group. Adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of PERJETA or placebo was 7% and 6%, respectively. The most common adverse reactions (&gt;0.5%) resulting in permanent discontinuation of any study treatment were ejection fraction decreased, neuropathy peripheral, diarrhea, and cardiac failure.  Table 6  reports the adverse reactions that occurred in at least 10% of patients in the PERJETA-treated group.



 When PERJETA was administered in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy, the most common adverse reactions (&gt; 30%) were diarrhea, nausea, alopecia, fatigue, peripheral neuropathy, and vomiting. The most common Grade 3 - 4 adverse reactions (&gt; 2%) were neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, diarrhea, neutrophil count decreased, anemia, white blood cell count decreased, leukopenia, fatigue, nausea, and stomatitis.



 The incidence of diarrhea, all Grades, was higher when chemotherapy was administered with targeted therapy (61% in the PERJETA-treated group vs. 34% in the placebo-treated group), and was higher when administered with non-anthracycline based therapy (85% in the PERJETA-treated group vs. 62% in the placebo-treated group) than with anthracycline based therapy (67% in the PERJETA-treated group vs. 41% in the placebo-treated group). The incidence of diarrhea during the period that targeted therapy was administered without chemotherapy was 18% in the PERJETA-treated group vs. 9% in the placebo-treated group. The median duration of all Grades diarrhea was 8 days for the PERJETA-treated group vs. 6 days for the placebo-treated group. The median duration of Grade &gt;=3 diarrhea was 20 days for the PERJETA-treated group vs. 8 days for the placebo-treated group. More patients required hospitalization for diarrhea as a serious adverse event in the PERJETA-treated group (2.4%) than in the placebo-treated group (0.7%).

   6.2 Immunogenicity

  As with all therapeutic proteins, there is the potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to pertuzumab in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading.



 Patients in CLEOPATRA were tested at multiple time-points for antibodies to PERJETA. 3% (13/389) of patients in the PERJETA-treated group and 7% (25/372) of patients in the placebo-treated group tested positive for anti-PERJETA antibodies. Of these 38 patients, none experienced anaphylactic/hypersensitivity reactions that were clearly related to the anti-drug antibodies (ADA). The presence of pertuzumab in patient serum at the levels expected at the time of ADA sampling can interfere with the ability of this assay to detect anti-pertuzumab antibodies. In addition, the assay may be detecting antibodies to trastuzumab. As a result, data may not accurately reflect the true incidence of anti-pertuzumab antibody development.



 In the neoadjuvant period of BERENICE, 0.3% (1/383) of patients treated with PERJETA tested positive for anti-PERJETA antibodies. This patient did not experience any anaphylactic/hypersensitivity reactions.



   6.3 Post-Marketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of PERJETA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 *  Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS): Cases of possible TLS have been reported in patients treated with PERJETA. Patients with significant tumor burden (e.g., bulky metastases) may be at a higher risk. Patients could present with hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acute renal failure which may represent possible TLS. Providers should consider additional monitoring and/or treatment as clinically indicated.

   5.1 Left Ventricular Dysfunction



   Decreases in LVEF have been reported with drugs that block HER2 activity, including PERJETA. Assess LVEF prior to initiation of PERJETA and at regular intervals during treatment to ensure that LVEF is within normal limits. If the LVEF declines and has not improved, or has declined further at the subsequent assessment, discontinuation of PERJETA and trastuzumab should be strongly considered [  Dosage and Administration (2.3)    ].  



  In CLEOPATRA, for patients with MBC, PERJETA in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel was not associated with increases in the incidence of symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) or decreases in LVEF compared with placebo in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel [see  Clinical Studies (14.1)  ]  . Left ventricular dysfunction occurred in 4% of patients in the PERJETA-treated group and 8% of patients in the placebo-treated group. Symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction (congestive heart failure) occurred in 1% of patients in the PERJETA-treated group and 2% of patients in the placebo-treated group [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Patients who have received prior anthracyclines or prior radiotherapy to the chest area may be at higher risk of decreased LVEF.  



  In patients receiving neoadjuvant treatment in NeoSphere, the incidence of LVSD was higher in the PERJETA-treated groups compared to the trastuzumab- and docetaxel-treated group. An increased incidence of LVEF declines was observed in patients treated with PERJETA in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel. In the overall treatment period, LVEF decline &gt; 10% and a drop to less than 50% occurred in 2% of patients treated with neoadjuvant trastuzumab and docetaxel as compared to 8% of patients treated with neoadjuvant PERJETA in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel. Left ventricular dysfunction occurred in 0.9% of patients treated with neoadjuvant trastuzumab and docetaxel as compared to 3% of patients treated with neoadjuvant PERJETA in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel. Symptomatic LVSD occurred in 0.9% of patients treated with neoadjuvant PERJETA in combination with trastuzumab and no patients in the other 3 arms. LVEF recovered to &gt;= 50% in all patients.  



  In patients receiving neoadjuvant PERJETA in TRYPHAENA, in the overall treatment period, LVEF decline &gt; 10% and a drop to less than 50% occurred in 7% of patients treated with PERJETA plus trastuzumab and FEC followed by PERJETA plus trastuzumab and docetaxel, 16% of patients treated with PERJETA plus trastuzumab and docetaxel following FEC, and 11% of patients treated with PERJETA in combination with TCH. Left ventricular dysfunction occurred in 6% of patients treated with PERJETA plus trastuzumab and FEC followed by PERJETA plus trastuzumab and docetaxel, 4% of patients treated with PERJETA plus trastuzumab and docetaxel following FEC, and 3% of patients treated with PERJETA in combination with TCH. Symptomatic LVSD occurred in 4% of patients treated with PERJETA plus trastuzumab and docetaxel following FEC, 1% of patients treated with PERJETA in combination with TCH, and none of the patients treated with PERJETA plus trastuzumab and FEC followed by PERJETA plus trastuzumab and docetaxel. LVEF recovered to &gt;= 50% in all but one patient.  



  In patients receiving neoadjuvant PERJETA in BERENICE, in the neoadjuvant period, LVEF decline &gt;= 10% and a drop to less than 50% as measured by ECHO/MUGA assessment occurred in 7% of patients treated with PERJETA plus trastuzumab and paclitaxel following ddAC, and 2% of patients treated with PERJETA plus trastuzumab and docetaxel following FEC. Ejection fraction decreased (asymptomatic LVD) occurred in 7% of patients treated with PERJETA plus trastuzumab and paclitaxel following ddAC and 4% of the patients treated with PERJETA plus trastuzumab and docetaxel following FEC in the neoadjuvant period. Symptomatic LVSD (NYHA Class III/IV Congestive Heart Failure) occurred in 2% of patients treated with PERJETA plus trastuzumab and paclitaxel following ddAC and none of the patients treated with PERJETA plus trastuzumab and docetaxel following FEC in the neoadjuvant period.  



  In patients receiving adjuvant PERJETA in APHINITY, the incidence of symptomatic heart failure (NYHA Class III/IV) with a LVEF decline &gt;= 10% and a drop to less than 50% was &lt;1% (0.6% of PERJETA-treated patients vs. 0.2% of placebo-treated patients). Of the patients who experienced symptomatic heart failure, 47% of PERJETA-treated patients and 67% of placebo-treated patients had recovered (defined as 2 consecutive LVEF measurements above 50%) at the data cutoff. The majority of the events (86%) were reported in anthracycline-treated patients. Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic (NYHA Class II) declines in LVEF &gt;= 10% and a drop to less than 50% were reported in 3% of PERJETA-treated patients and 3% of placebo-treated patients, of whom 80% of PERJETA-treated patients and 81% of placebo-treated patients recovered at the data cutoff.  



 PERJETA has not been studied in patients with a pretreatment LVEF value of &lt;= 50%, a prior history of CHF, decreases in LVEF to &lt; 50% during prior trastuzumab therapy, or conditions that could impair left ventricular function such as uncontrolled hypertension, recent myocardial infarction, serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring treatment or a cumulative prior anthracycline exposure to &gt; 360 mg/m  2  of doxorubicin or its equivalent.



    5.2 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animal studies, PERJETA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. PERJETA is a HER2/neu receptor antagonist. Cases of oligohydramnios and oligohydramnios sequence manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death have been reported with use of another HER2/neu receptor antagonist (trastuzumab) during pregnancy. In an animal reproduction study, administration of pertuzumab to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys during the period of organogenesis resulted in oligohydramnios, delayed fetal kidney development, and embryo-fetal death at exposures 2.5 to 20 times the exposure in humans at the recommended dose, based on Cmax.



 Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of PERJETA. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential that exposure to PERJETA in combination with trastuzumab during pregnancy or within 7 months prior to conception can result in fetal harm, including embryo-fetal death or birth defects. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 7 months following the last dose of PERJETA in combination with trastuzumab [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1  ,  8.3)  ]  .



    5.3 Infusion-Related Reactions



   PERJETA has been associated with infusion reactions, including fatal events. [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  An infusion reaction was defined in CLEOPATRA as any event described as hypersensitivity, anaphylactic reaction, acute infusion reaction, or cytokine release syndrome occurring during an infusion or on the same day as the infusion. The initial dose of PERJETA was given the day before trastuzumab and docetaxel to allow for the examination of PERJETA-associated reactions. On the first day, when only PERJETA was administered, the overall frequency of infusion reactions was 13% in the PERJETA-treated group and 10% in the placebo-treated group. Less than 1% were Grade 3 or 4. The most common infusion reactions (&gt;= 1.0%) were pyrexia, chills, fatigue, headache, asthenia, hypersensitivity, and vomiting.  



  During the second cycle when all drugs were administered on the same day, the most common infusion reactions in the PERJETA-treated group (&gt;= 1.0%) were fatigue, dysgeusia, hypersensitivity, myalgia, and vomiting.  



  In NeoSphere, TRYPHAENA, and APHINITY, PERJETA was administered on the same day as the other study treatment drugs. For APHINITY, infusion-related reactions occurred in 21% of patients on the first day of PERJETA administration (in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy) and in 18% of patients in the placebo arm. The incidence of Grade 3-4 National Cancer Institute - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI - CTCAE v4.0) reactions was 1% for the PERJETA arm and 0.7% for the placebo arm.  



 Observe patients closely for 60 minutes after the first infusion and for 30 minutes after subsequent infusions of PERJETA. If a significant infusion-related reaction occurs, slow or interrupt the infusion, and administer appropriate medical therapies. Monitor patients carefully until complete resolution of signs and symptoms. Consider permanent discontinuation in patients with severe infusion reactions [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ].  



    5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions/Anaphylaxis



   In CLEOPATRA, the overall frequency of hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis reactions was 11% in the PERJETA-treated group and 9% in the placebo-treated group. The incidence of Grade 3 - 4 hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis reactions was 2% in the PERJETA-treated group and 3% in the placebo-treated group according to NCI - CTCAE v3.0. Overall, 4 patients in the PERJETA-treated group and 2 patients in the placebo-treated group experienced anaphylaxis.  



  In NeoSphere, TRYPHAENA, BERENICE, and APHINITY, hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis events were consistent with those observed in CLEOPATRA. In NeoSphere, two patients in the PERJETA- and docetaxel-treated group experienced anaphylaxis. In APHINITY, the overall frequency of hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis was 5% in the PERJETA treated group vs. 4% in the placebo-treated group. The incidence was highest in the PERJETA plus TCH treated group (8%) of which 1% were NCI-CTCAE (v4.0) Grade 3 - 4.  



  Patients should be observed closely for hypersensitivity reactions. Severe hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis and fatal events, have been observed in patients treated with PERJETA [see  Clinical Trials Experience (6.1)  ]  . Angioedema has been described in post-marketing reports. Medications to treat such reactions, as well as emergency equipment, should be available for immediate use. PERJETA is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to pertuzumab or to any of its excipients [see  Contraindications (4)  ].
