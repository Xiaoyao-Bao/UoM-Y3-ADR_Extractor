  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



     Clinical trials in HIV-associated wasting or cachexia:  



 In the 12-week, placebo-controlled Clinical Trial 2, 510 patients were treated with SEROSTIM. The most common adverse reactions judged to be associated with SEROSTIM were musculoskeletal discomfort and increased tissue turgor (swelling, particularly of the hands or feet), and were more frequently observed when SEROSTIM 0.1 mg/kg was administered on a daily basis  [Table 1 and Warnings and Precautions (5)].  These symptoms often subsided with continued treatment or dose reduction. Approximately 23% of patients receiving SEROSTIM 0.1 mg/kg daily and 11% of patients receiving 0.1 mg/kg every other day required dose reductions. Discontinuations as a result of adverse reactions occurred in 10.3% of patients receiving SEROSTIM 0.1 mg/kg daily and 6.6% of patients receiving 0.1 mg/kg every other day. The most common reasons for dose reduction and/or drug discontinuation were arthralgia, myalgia, edema, carpal tunnel syndrome, elevated glucose levels, and elevated triglyceride levels.



 Clinical adverse reactions which occurred during the first 12 weeks of study in at least 5% of the patients in either active treatment group and at an incidence greater than placebo are listed below, without regard to causality assessment.

          Adverse reactions that occurred in 1% to less than 5% of trial participants receiving SEROSTIM during the first 12 weeks of Clinical Trial 2 thought to be related to SEROSTIM included dose dependent edema, periorbital edema, carpal tunnel syndrome, hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia.
 

 During the 12-week, placebo-controlled portion of Clinical Trial 2, the incidence of hyperglycemia reported as an adverse reaction was 3.6% for the placebo group, 1.9% for the 0.1 mg/kg every other day group and 3.2% for the 0.1 mg/kg daily group. One case of diabetes mellitus was noted in the 0.1 mg/kg daily group during the first 12-weeks of therapy. In addition, during the extension phase of Clinical Trial 2, two patients converted from placebo to full dose SEROSTIM, and 1 patient converted from placebo to half-dose SEROSTIM, were discontinued because of the development of diabetes mellitus.



 The types and incidences of adverse reactions reported during the Clinical Trial 2 extension phase were not different from, or greater in frequency than those observed during the 12-week, placebo-controlled portion of Clinical Trial 2.



     Adverse reactions from treatment with SEROSTIM in clinical trials in HIV lipodystrophy  



 SEROSTIM was evaluated for the treatment of patients with HIV lipodystrophy in two double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that excluded patients with a history of diabetes, impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose (approximately 20% of the patients screened were excluded from study enrollment as a result of a diagnosis of diabetes or glucose intolerance). The studies included a 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group "induction" phase followed by maintenance phases of different durations (12 and 24 weeks, respectively). In the initial 12-week treatment periods of the two, placebo-controlled clinical trials, 406 patients were treated with SEROSTIM. Clinical adverse reactions which occurred during the first 12 weeks of both studies combined in at least 5% of the patients in either of the two active treatment groups are listed by treatment group in Table 2, without regard to causality assessment. The most common adverse reactions judged to be associated with SEROSTIM were edema, arthralgia, pain in extremity, hypoesthesia, myalgia, and blood glucose increased, all of which were more frequently observed when SEROSTIM 4 mg was administered on a daily basis compared with alternate days. These symptoms often subsided with dose reduction. During the 12-week induction phase, 1) approximately 26% of patients receiving SEROSTIM 4 mg daily and 19% of patients receiving SEROSTIM4 mg every other day required dose reductions; and 2) discontinuations as a result of adverse reactions occurred in 13% of patients receiving SEROSTIM 4 mg daily and 5% of patients receiving SEROSTIM 4 mg every other day. The most common reasons for dose reduction and/or drug discontinuation were peripheral edema, hyperglycemia (including blood glucose increased, blood glucose abnormal, and hyperglycemia), and arthralgia.

              Glucose metabolism related adverse reactions:  During the initial 12-week treatment periods of Studies 1 and 2, the incidence of glucose-related adverse reactions was 4% for the placebo group, 13% for the 4 mg every other day group and 22% for the 4 mg daily group.
 

 Twenty-three patients discontinued due to hyperglycemia while receiving SEROSTIM during any phase of these studies (3.2% in the 12-week induction phases and 2.1% in the extension phases).



     Breast-Related Terms:  When grouped together, breast-related adverse reactions (e.g. nipple pain, gynecomastia, breast pain/mass/tenderness/swelling/edema/hypertrophy) had an incidence of 1% for the placebo group, 3% for the SEROSTIM 4 mg every other day group and 6% for the SEROSTIM 4 mg daily group.



 Adverse reactions that occurred in 1% to less than 5% of trial participants receiving SEROSTIM during the first 12 weeks of HIV Lipodystrophy Studies 1 and 2 thought to be related to SEROSTIM include carpal tunnel syndrome, Tinel's sign and facial edema.



 The adverse reactions reported for SEROSTIM 4 mg every other day during the maintenance phase of HIV Lipodystrophy Study 1 (Week 12 to Week 24) were similar in frequency and quality to those observed after treatment with SEROSTIM 4 mg every other day during the 12-week induction phase.



 IGF-1 serum concentrations increased statistically in SEROSTIM-treated patients when compared to placebo (Table 3). In the SEROSTIM treated patients at baseline, the proportion of subjects with serum IGF-1 SDS levels &gt;= +2 was approximately 10 to 20%, while with treatment with either dose regimen of SEROSTIM the percentage increased to 80 to 90% by Week 12.

           As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influences by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to SEROSTIM with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.
 

 After 12 weeks of treatment, none of the 651 study participants with HIV-associated wasting treated with SEROSTIM for the first time developed detectable antibodies to growth hormone (&gt; 4 pg binding). Patients were not rechallenged. Data beyond 3 months is not available.



   6.2 Post-Marketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of SEROSTIM. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 Hypersensitivity: Serious systemic hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and angioedema have been reported with postmarketing use of somatropin products  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.6)  ].  



 Endocrine:



 *  new onset impaired glucose tolerance 
 *  new onset type 2 diabetes mellitus 
 *  exacerbation of preexisting diabetes mellitus 
 *  diabetic ketoacidosis 
 *  diabetic coma 
    In some patients, these conditions improved when SEROSTIM was discontinued, while in others the glucose intolerance persisted. Some of these patients required initiation or adjustment of antidiabetic treatment while on SEROSTIM  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.4)  ]  .
 

 Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.9)  ]  .

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Acute Critical Illness: Increased mortality in patients with acute critical illness following open heart surgery, abdominal surgery or multiple accidental trauma, or those with acute respiratory failure has been reported after treatment with pharmacologic amounts of somatropin (  5.1  ) 
 *  Concomitant Antiretroviral Therapy: In vitro experimental systems have demonstrated the potential to potentiate HIV replication. No significant somatropin-associated increase in viral load was observed in clinical trials. HIV patients should be maintained on antiretroviral therapy for the duration of SEROSTIM treatment (  5.2  ) 
 *  Neoplasms: Monitor all patients with a history of any neoplasm routinely while on somatropin therapy for progression, recurrences, or development of a tumor (  5.3  ) 
 *  Impaired Glucose Tolerance/Diabetes: May be unmasked. Periodically monitor glucose levels. Dose adjustment of concurrent antihyperglycemic drugs in diabetics may be required (  5.4  ) 
 *  Intracranial Hypertension: Exclude preexisting papilledema. May develop and is usually reversible after discontinuation or dose reduction (  5.5  ) 
 *  Hypersensitivity: Serious hypersensitivity reactions may occur. In the event of an allergic reaction, seek prompt medical attention (  5.6  ) 
 *  Fluid Retention (edema, arthralgia)/Carpal Tunnel Syndrome: May occur frequently. Reduce dose as necessary (  5.7  ) 
 *  Pancreatitis: Consider pancreatitis in patients with persistent severe abdominal pain (  5.9  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Acute Critical Illness



   Increased mortality in patients with acute critical illness due to complications following open heart surgery, abdominal surgery or multiple accidental trauma, or those with acute respiratory failure has been reported after treatment with pharmacologic  amounts of somatropin. Two placebo-controlled clinical trials in non-growth hormone deficient adult patients (n=522) with these conditions revealed a significant increase in mortality (42% vs. 19%) among somatropin-treated patients (doses 5.3-8 mg/day) compared to those receiving placebo [see  Contraindications (4)  ]  .  



    5.2 Concomitant Antiretroviral Therapy



  In some experimental systems, somatropin has been shown to potentiate HIV replication in vitro at concentrations ranging from 50-250 ng/mL. There was no increase in virus production when the antiretroviral agents, zidovudine, didanosine or lamivudine were added to the culture medium. Additional in vitro studies have shown that somatropin does not interfere with the antiviral activity of zalcitabine or stavudine. In the controlled clinical trials, no significant somatropin-associated increase in viral burden was observed. However, the protocol required all participants to be on concomitant antiretroviral therapy for the duration of the study. In view of the potential for acceleration of virus replication, it is recommended that HIV patients be maintained on antiretroviral therapy for the duration of SEROSTIM treatment.



    5.3 Neoplasms



  Because malignancies are more common in HIV positive individuals, the risks and benefits of starting somatropin in HIV positive patients should be carefully considered before initiating SEROSTIM treatment and patients should be monitored carefully for the development of neoplasms if treatment with somatropin is initiated.



 Monitor all patients with a history of any neoplasm routinely while on somatropin therapy for progression or recurrence of the tumor [see  Contraindications (4)  ].  



 Monitor patients on somatropin therapy carefully for increased growth, or potential malignant changes of preexisting nevi.



    5.4 Impaired Glucose Tolerance/Diabetes



  Hyperglycemia may occur in HIV infected individuals due to a variety of reasons. In wasting patients, treatment with SEROSTIM 0.1 mg/kg daily and 0.1 mg/kg every other day for 12 weeks was associated with approximately 10 mg/dL and 6 mg/dL increases in mean fasting blood glucose concentrations, respectively. The increases occurred early in treatment. Patients with other risk factors for glucose intolerance should be monitored closely during SEROSTIM therapy.



 During safety surveillance of patients with HIV-associated wasting, cases of new onset impaired glucose tolerance, new onset type 2 diabetes mellitus and exacerbation of preexisting diabetes mellitus have been reported in patients receiving SEROSTIM. Some patients developed diabetic ketoacidosis and diabetic coma. In some patients, these conditions improved when SEROSTIM was discontinued, while in others, the glucose intolerance persisted. Some of these patients required initiation or adjustment of antidiabetic treatment while on SEROSTIM.



 In clinical trials of SEROSTIM conducted in HIV patients with lipodystrophy (an unapproved indication), evidence of dose-dependent glucose intolerance and related adverse reaction was observed at doses of 4 mg SEROSTIM daily and 4 mg SEROSTIM every other day for 12 weeks [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



    5.5 Intracranial Hypertension



  Intracranial hypertension (IH) with papilledema, visual changes, headache, nausea, and/or vomiting has been reported in a small number of patients treated with somatropin products. Symptoms usually occurred within the first eight (8) weeks after the initiation of somatropin therapy. In all reported cases, IH-associated signs and symptoms rapidly resolved after cessation of therapy or a reduction of the somatropin dose. Funduscopic examination should be performed routinely before initiating treatment with somatropin to exclude preexisting papilledema, and periodically during the course of somatropin therapy. If papilledema is observed by funduscopy during somatropin treatment, treatment should be stopped. If somatropin-induced IH is diagnosed, treatment with somatropin can be restarted at a lower dose after IH-associated signs and symptoms have resolved.



    5.6 Severe Hypersensitivity



   Serious systemic hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and angioedema have been reported with postmarketing use of somatropin products. Patients and caregivers should be informed that such reactions are possible and that prompt medical attention should be sought if an allergic reaction occurs [see  Contraindications (4)  ].    



    5.7 Fluid Retention/Carpal Tunnel Syndrome



  Increased tissue turgor (swelling, particularly in the hands and feet) and musculoskeletal discomfort (pain, swelling and/or stiffness) may occur during treatment with SEROSTIM, but may resolve spontaneously, with analgesic therapy, or after reducing the frequency of dosing [see  Dosage and Administration (2.1)  ].  



 Carpal tunnel syndrome may occur during treatment with SEROSTIM. If the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome do not resolve by decreasing the weekly number of doses of SEROSTIM, it is recommended that treatment be discontinued.



    5.8 Lipoatrophy



  When somatropin is administered subcutaneously at the same site over a long period of time, tissue atrophy may result. This can be avoided by rotating the injection site [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  .



    5.9 Pancreatitis



  Cases of pancreatitis have been reported rarely in children and adults receiving somatropin treatment, with some evidence supporting a greater risk in children compared with adults. Published literature indicates that girls who have Turner syndrome may be at greater risk than other somatropin-treated children. Pancreatitis should be considered in any somatropin-treated patient, especially a child who develops abdominal pain.
