  The table below presents the incidences of adverse reactions derived from an analysis of data contained within literature reports of 7 studies involving 303 pediatric patients in which VUMON was administered by injection as a single agent in a variety of doses and schedules for a variety of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. The total number of patients evaluable for a given event was not 303 since the individual studies did not address the occurrence of each event listed. Five of these 7 studies assessed VUMON activity in hematologic malignancies, such as leukemia. Thus, many of these patients had abnormal hematologic status at start of therapy with VUMON and were expected to develop significant myelosuppression as an endpoint of treatment.

        Hematologic Toxicity
   VUMON, when used with other chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of ALL, results in severe myelosuppression. Sepsis, sometimes fatal, may be a consequence of severe myelosuppression. Early onset of profound myelosuppression with delayed recovery can be expected when using the doses and schedules of VUMON necessary for treatment of refractory ALL, since bone marrow hypoplasia is a desired endpoint of therapy. The occurrence of acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL), with or without a preleukemic phase, has been reported in patients treated with VUMON in combination with other antineoplastic agents. (See    PRECAUTIONS: Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility    .)



   Gastrointestinal Toxicity

  Nausea and vomiting are the most common gastrointestinal toxicities, having occurred in 29% of evaluable pediatric patients. The severity of this nausea and vomiting is generally mild to moderate.



   Hypotension

  Transient hypotension following rapid intravenous administration has been reported in 2% of evaluable pediatric patients. One episode of sudden death, attributed to probable arrhythmia and intractable hypotension, has been reported in an elderly patient receiving VUMON combination therapy for a non-leukemic malignancy.



 No other cardiac toxicity or electrocardiographic changes have been documented. No delayed hypotension has been noted.



   Allergic Reactions

  Hypersensitivity reactions characterized by chills, fever, tachycardia, flushing, bronchospasm, dyspnea, rash, and blood pressure changes (hypertension or hypotension) have been reported to occur in approximately 5% of evaluable pediatric patients receiving intravenous VUMON. The incidence of hypersensitivity reactions to VUMON appears to be increased in patients with brain tumors and in patients with neuroblastoma.



   Central Nervous System

    Neurotoxicity has been reported, including severe cases of neuropathy, in patients receiving vincristine sulfate and VUMON concomitantly.  



 Acute central nervous system depression and hypotension have been observed in patients receiving investigational infusions of high-dose VUMON who were pretreated with antiemetic drugs. The depressant effects of the antiemetic agents and the alcohol content of the VUMON formulation may place patients receiving higher than recommended doses of VUMON at risk for central nervous system depression.



   Alopecia

  Alopecia, sometimes progressing to total baldness, was observed in 9% of evaluable pediatric patients who received VUMON as single-agent therapy. It was usually reversible.



   Other Adverse Reactions

  The following adverse reactions have been reported: headache, confusion, and asthenia. Headache and confusion were associated with hypersensitivity reactions.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING

  WARNING

  VUMON

(teniposide injection) is a cytotoxic drug which should be administered under

the supervision of a qualified physician experienced in the use of cancer

chemotherapeutic agents. Appropriate management of therapy and complications

is possible only when adequate treatment facilities are readily available.



 Severe

myelosuppression with resulting infection or bleeding may occur. Hypersensitivity

reactions, including anaphylaxis-like symptoms, may occur with initial dosing

or at repeated exposure to VUMON. Epinephrine, with or without corticosteroids

and antihistamines, has been employed to alleviate hypersensitivity reaction

symptoms.

   General



  In all instances where the use of VUMON is considered for chemotherapy, the physician must evaluate the need and usefulness of the drug against the risk of adverse reactions. Most such adverse reactions are reversible if detected early. If severe reactions occur, the drug should be reduced in dosage or discontinued and appropriate corrective measures should be taken according to the clinical judgment of the physician. Reinstitution of VUMON therapy should be carried out with caution, and with adequate consideration of the further need for the drug and alertness as to possible recurrence of toxicity.



 VUMON must be administered as an intravenous infusion. Care should be taken to ensure that the intravenous catheter or needle is in the proper position and functional prior to infusion. Improper administration of VUMON may result in extravasation causing local tissue necrosis and/or thrombophlebitis. In some instances, occlusion of central venous access devices has occurred during 24-hour infusion of VUMON at a concentration of 0.1 to 0.2 mg/mL. Frequent observation during these infusions is necessary to minimize this risk.



    Laboratory Tests



  Periodic complete blood counts and assessments of renal and hepatic function should be done during the course of VUMON treatment. They should be performed prior to therapy and at clinically appropriate intervals during and after therapy. There should be at least one determination of hematologic status prior to therapy with VUMON.



    Drug Interactions



  In a study in which 34 different drugs were tested, therapeutically relevant concentrations of tolbutamide, sodium salicylate, and sulfamethizole displaced protein-bound teniposide in fresh human serum to a small but significant extent. Because of the extremely high binding of teniposide to plasma proteins, these small decreases in binding could cause substantial increases in free drug levels in plasma which could result in potentiation of drug toxicity. Therefore, caution should be used in administering VUMON to patients receiving these other agents. There was no change in the plasma kinetics of teniposide when coadministered with methotrexate. However, the plasma clearance of methotrexate was slightly increased. An increase in intracellular levels of methotrexate was observed in vitro  in the presence of teniposide.



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility



  Children at SJCRH with ALL in remission who received maintenance therapy with VUMON at weekly or twice weekly doses (plus other chemotherapeutic agents), had a relative risk of developing secondary acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) approximately 12 times that of patients treated according to other less intensive schedules.



 A short course of VUMON for remission-induction and/or consolidation therapy was not associated with an increased risk of secondary ANLL, but the number of patients assessed was small. The potential benefit from VUMON must be weighed on a case by case basis against the potential risk of the induction of a secondary leukemia. The carcinogenicity of teniposide has not been studied in laboratory animals. Compounds with similar mechanisms of action and mutagenicity profiles have been reported to be carcinogenic and teniposide should be considered a potential carcinogen in humans. Teniposide has been shown to be mutagenic in various bacterial and mammalian genetic toxicity tests. These include positive mutagenic effects in the Ames/Salmonella and B. subtilis  bacterial mutagenicity assays. Teniposide caused gene mutations in both Chinese hamster ovary cells and mouse lymphoma cells and DNA damage as measured by alkaline elution in human lung carcinoma derived cell lines. In addition, teniposide induced aberrations in chromosome structure in primary cultures of human lymphocytes in vitro  and in L5178y/TK +/- mouse lymphoma cells in vitro  . Chromosome aberrations were observed in vivo  in the embryonic tissue of pregnant Swiss albino mice treated with teniposide. Teniposide also caused a dose-related increase in sister chromatid exchanges in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and it has been shown to be embryotoxic and teratogenic in rats receiving teniposide during organogenesis. Treatment of pregnant rats intravenously with doses between 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg/day on alternate days from day 6 to 16 post coitum caused retardation of embryonic development, prenatal mortality, and fetal abnormalities.



    Pregnancy



    Pregnancy Category D  



  See   WARNINGS    .



    Nursing Mothers



  It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of VUMON therapy to the mother.



    Pediatric Use



  Adverse events were evaluated in 7 studies involving 303 patients (age range 0.5 months to 20 years) who received VUMON as a single agent (see   ADVERSE REACTIONS    ). No association between any particular age group and adverse effects was reported in any of these investigations.



    Patients with Down Syndrome



  Patients with both Down syndrome and leukemia may be especially sensitive to myelosuppressive chemotherapy, therefore, initial dosing with VUMON should be reduced in these patients. It is suggested that the first course of VUMON should be given at half the usual dose. Subsequent courses may be administered at higher dosages depending on the degree of myelosuppression and mucositis encountered in earlier courses in an individual patient.
</Section>
    <Section id="S4" name="warnings">    WARNINGS



  VUMON is a potent drug and should be used only by physicians experienced in the administration of cancer chemotherapeutic drugs. Blood counts, as well as renal and hepatic function tests, should be carefully monitored prior to and during therapy.



   Patients being treated with VUMON (teniposide injection) should be observed frequently for myelosuppression both during and after therapy. Dose-limiting bone marrow suppression is the most significant toxicity associated with VUMON therapy. Therefore, the following studies should be obtained at the start of therapy and prior to each subsequent dose of VUMON: hemoglobin, white blood cell count and differential, and platelet count. If necessary, repeat bone marrow examination should be performed prior to the decision to continue therapy in the setting of severe myelosuppression.



    Physicians should be aware of the possible occurrence of a hypersensitivity reaction variably manifested by chills, fever, urticaria, tachycardia, bronchospasm, dyspnea, hypertension or hypotension, rash, and facial flushing. This reaction may occur with the first dose of VUMON and may be life threatening if not treated promptly with antihistamines, corticosteroids, epinephrine, intravenous fluids, and other supportive measures as clinically indicated. The exact cause of these reactions is unknown. They may be due to the Cremophor  (r)  EL (polyoxyethylated castor oil) component of the vehicle or to teniposide itself. Patients who have experienced prior hypersensitivity reactions to VUMON are at risk for recurrence of symptoms and should only be re-treated with VUMON if the antileukemic benefit already demonstrated clearly outweighs the risk of a probable hypersensitivity reaction for that patient. When a decision is made to re-treat a patient with VUMON in spite of an earlier hypersensitivity reaction, the patient should be pretreated with corticosteroids and antihistamines and receive careful clinical observation during and after VUMON infusion. In the clinical experience with VUMON at SJCRH and the National Cancer Institute (NCI), re-treatment of patients with prior hypersensitivity reactions has been accomplished using measures described above. To date, there is no evidence to suggest cross-sensitization between VUMON and VePesid  (r)  .  



    One episode of sudden death, attributed to probable arrhythmia and intractable hypotension, has been reported in an elderly patient receiving VUMON combination therapy for a non-leukemic malignancy. (See  ADVERSE REACTIONS  .) Patients receiving VUMON treatment should be under continuous observation for at least the first 60 minutes following the start of the infusion and at frequent intervals thereafter. If symptoms or signs of anaphylaxis occur, the infusion should be stopped immediately, followed by the administration of epinephrine, corticosteroids, antihistamines, pressor agents, or volume expanders at the discretion of the physician. An aqueous solution of epinephrine 1:1000 and a source of oxygen should be available at the bedside.  



   For parenteral administration, VUMON should be given only by slow intravenous infusion (lasting at least 30 to 60 minutes) since hypotension has been reported as a possible side effect of rapid intravenous injection, perhaps due to a direct effect of Cremophor  (r)  EL. If clinically significant hypotension develops, the VUMON infusion should be discontinued. The blood pressure usually normalizes within hours in response to cessation of the infusion and administration of fluids or other supportive therapy as appropriate. If the infusion is restarted, a slower administration rate should be used and the patient should be carefully monitored.



   Acute central nervous system depression, hypotension, and metabolic acidosis have been observed in patients receiving investigational infusions of high-dose VUMON who were pretreated with antiemetic drugs. The depressant effects of the antiemetic agents and the alcohol content of the VUMON formulation may place patients receiving higher than recommended doses of VUMON at risk for central nervous system depression.



    Pregnancy



    Pregnancy Category D  



  VUMON may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. VUMON has been shown to be teratogenic and embryotoxic in laboratory animals. In pregnant rats, intravenous administration of VUMON, 0.1 to 3 mg/kg (0.6-18 mg/m  2  ), every second day from day 6 to day 16 post coitum caused dose-related embryotoxicity and teratogenicity. Major anomalies included spinal and rib defects, deformed extremities, anophthalmia, and celosomia.



 There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. If VUMON is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant during therapy with VUMON.



    Male Fertility



  In animal studies, VUMON caused a decrease in sperm count and genetic damage to sperm. No studies have been done to demonstrate the effect of these changes on human sperm and male fertility. Young men of reproductive age should be advised of the possibility that VUMON treatment may compromise their ability to father a child and that there is some possibility for birth defects if they do. They should be counseled on the possibility of storing sperm for future artificial insemination.
