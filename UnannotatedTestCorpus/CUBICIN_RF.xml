  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     Clinical Trial Experience in Adult Patients  



 Clinical trials enrolled 1,864 adult patients treated with CUBICIN and 1,416 treated with comparator.



     Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infection Trials in Adults  



 In Phase 3 complicated skin and skin structure infection (cSSSI) trials in adult patients, CUBICIN was discontinued in 15/534 (2.8%) patients due to an adverse reaction, while comparator was discontinued in 17/558 (3.0%) patients.



 The rates of the most common adverse reactions, organized by body system, observed in adult patients with cSSSI (receiving 4 mg/kg CUBICIN) are displayed in Table 7.

     S. aureus Bacteremia/Endocarditis Trial in Adults  



 In the  S. aureus  bacteremia/endocarditis trial involving adult patients, CUBICIN was discontinued in 20/120 (16.7%) patients due to an adverse reaction, while comparator was discontinued in 21/116 (18.1%) patients.



 Serious Gram-negative infections (including bloodstream infections) were reported in 10/120 (8.3%) CUBICIN-treated patients and 0/115 comparator-treated patients. Comparator-treated patients received dual therapy that included initial gentamicin for 4 days. Infections were reported during treatment and during early and late follow-up. Gram-negative infections included cholangitis, alcoholic pancreatitis, sternal osteomyelitis/mediastinitis, bowel infarction, recurrent Crohn's disease, recurrent line sepsis, and recurrent urosepsis caused by a number of different Gram-negative bacteria.



 The rates of the most common adverse reactions, organized by System Organ Class (SOC), observed in adult patients with  S. aureus  bacteremia/endocarditis (receiving 6 mg/kg CUBICIN) are displayed in Table 8.

     Other Trials in Adults  



 In Phase 3 trials of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adult patients, the death rate and rates of serious cardiorespiratory adverse events were higher in CUBICIN-treated patients than in comparator-treated patients. These differences were due to lack of therapeutic effectiveness of CUBICIN in the treatment of CAP in patients experiencing these adverse events  [see  Indications and Usage (1.4)  ].  



     Laboratory Changes in Adults  



     Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infection Trials in Adults  



 In Phase 3 cSSSI trials of adult patients receiving CUBICIN at a dose of 4 mg/kg, elevations in CPK were reported as clinical adverse events in 15/534 (2.8%) CUBICIN-treated patients, compared with 10/558 (1.8%) comparator-treated patients. Of the 534 patients treated with CUBICIN, 1 (0.2%) had symptoms of muscle pain or weakness associated with CPK elevations to greater than 4 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). The symptoms resolved within 3 days and CPK returned to normal within 7 to 10 days after treatment was discontinued  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ].  Table 9 summarizes the CPK shifts from Baseline through End of Therapy in the cSSSI adult trials.

 In the  S. aureus  bacteremia/endocarditis trial in adult patients, at a dose of 6 mg/kg, 11/120 (9.2%) CUBICIN-treated patients, including two patients with baseline CPK levels &gt;500 U/L, had CPK elevations to levels &gt;500 U/L, compared with 1/116 (0.9%) comparator-treated patients. Of the 11 CUBICIN-treated patients, 4 had prior or concomitant treatment with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. Three of these 11 CUBICIN-treated patients discontinued therapy due to CPK elevation, while the one comparator-treated patient did not discontinue therapy  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ].  



     Clinical Trial Experience in Pediatric Patients  



     Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infection Trial in Pediatric Patients  



 The safety of CUBICIN was evaluated in one clinical trial (in cSSSI), which included 256 pediatric patients (1 to 17 years of age) treated with intravenous CUBICIN and 133 patients treated with comparator agents. Patients were given age-dependent doses once daily for a treatment period of up to 14 days (median treatment period was 3 days). The doses given by age group were as follows: 10mg/kg for 1 to &lt; 2 years, 9 mg/kg for 2 to 6 years, 7mg/kg for 7 to 11 years and 5 mg/kg for 12 to 17 years of age  [see  Clinical Studies (14)  ]  . Patients treated with CUBICIN were (51%) male, (49%) female and (46%) Caucasian and (32%) Asian.



     Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation  



 In the cSSSI study, CUBICIN was discontinued in 7/256 (2.7%) patients due to an adverse reaction, while comparator was discontinued in 7/133 (5.3%) patients.



     Most Common Adverse Reactions  



 The rates of the most common adverse reactions, organized by body system, observed in these pediatric patients with cSSSI are displayed in Table 10.

         The safety profile in the clinical trial of cSSSI pediatric patients was similar to that observed in the cSSSI adult patients.
 

     S. aureus Bacteremia Trial in Pediatric Patients  



 The safety of CUBICIN was evaluated in one clinical trial (in  S. aureus  bacteremia), which treated 55 pediatric patients with intravenous CUBICIN and 26 patients with comparator agents. Patients were given age-dependent doses once daily for a treatment period of up to 42 days (mean duration of IV treatment was 12 days). The doses by age group were as follows: 12 mg/kg for 1 to &lt;6 years, 9 mg/kg for 7 to 11 years and 7 mg/kg for 12 to 17 years of age  [see  Clinical Studies (14)  ]  . Patients treated with CUBICIN were (69%) male and (31%) female. No patients 1 to &lt;2 years of age were enrolled.



     Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation  



 In the bacteremia study, CUBICIN was discontinued in 3/55 (5.5%) patients due to an adverse reaction, while comparator was discontinued in 2/26 (7.7%) patients.



     Most Common Adverse Reactions  



 The rates of the most common adverse reactions, organized by body system, observed in these pediatric patients with bacteremia are displayed in Table 11.

           6.2 Post-Marketing Experience
   The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of CUBICIN. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

   5.1 Anaphylaxis/Hypersensitivity Reactions



  Anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with the use of antibacterial agents, including CUBICIN, and may be life-threatening. If an allergic reaction to CUBICIN RF occurs, discontinue the drug and institute appropriate therapy [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ].  



    5.2 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis



  Myopathy, defined as muscle aching or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values to greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), has been reported with the use of CUBICIN. Rhabdomyolysis, with or without acute renal failure, has been reported [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ]  .



 Patients receiving CUBICIN RF should be monitored for the development of muscle pain or weakness, particularly of the distal extremities. In patients who receive CUBICIN RF, CPK levels should be monitored weekly, and more frequently in patients who received recent prior or concomitant therapy with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor or in whom elevations in CPK occur during treatment with CUBICIN RF.



 In adult patients with renal impairment, both renal function and CPK should be monitored more frequently than once weekly [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.6)  and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ].  



 In Phase 1 studies and Phase 2 clinical trials in adults, CPK elevations appeared to be more frequent when CUBICIN was dosed more than once daily. Therefore, CUBICIN RF should not be dosed more frequently than once a day.



 CUBICIN RF should be discontinued in patients with unexplained signs and symptoms of myopathy in conjunction with CPK elevations to levels &gt;1,000 U/L (~5* ULN), and in patients without reported symptoms who have marked elevations in CPK, with levels &gt;2,000 U/L (&gt;=10* ULN). In addition, consideration should be given to suspending agents associated with rhabdomyolysis, such as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, temporarily in patients receiving CUBICIN RF [see  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ].  



    5.3 Eosinophilic Pneumonia



  Eosinophilic pneumonia has been reported in patients receiving CUBICIN [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ].  In reported cases associated with CUBICIN, patients developed fever, dyspnea with hypoxic respiratory insufficiency, and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates or organizing pneumonia. In general, patients developed eosinophilic pneumonia 2 to 4 weeks after starting CUBICIN and improved when CUBICIN was discontinued and steroid therapy was initiated. Recurrence of eosinophilic pneumonia upon re-exposure has been reported. Patients who develop these signs and symptoms while receiving CUBICIN RF should undergo prompt medical evaluation, and CUBICIN RF should be discontinued immediately. Treatment with systemic steroids is recommended.



    5.4 Peripheral Neuropathy



  Cases of peripheral neuropathy have been reported during the CUBICIN postmarketing experience [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ].  Therefore, physicians should be alert to signs and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy in patients receiving CUBICIN RF. Monitor for neuropathy and consider discontinuation.



    5.5 Potential Nervous System and/or Muscular System Effects in Pediatric Patients Younger than 12 Months



  Avoid use of CUBICIN RF in pediatric patients younger than 12 months due to the risk of potential effects on muscular, neuromuscular, and/or nervous systems (either peripheral and/or central) observed in neonatal dogs with intravenous daptomycin [see  Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)  ].  



    5.6 Clostridium difficile  -Associated Diarrhea



   Clostridium difficile  -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with the use of nearly all systemic antibacterial agents, including CUBICIN, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ].  Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon, leading to overgrowth of C. difficile  .



  C. difficile  produces toxins A and B, which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile  cause increased morbidity and mortality, since these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary because CDAD has been reported to occur more than 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents.



 If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial use not directed against C. difficile  may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile  , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.



    5.7 Persisting or Relapsing S. aureus  Bacteremia/Endocarditis



  Patients with persisting or relapsing S. aureus  bacteremia/endocarditis or poor clinical response should have repeat blood cultures. If a blood culture is positive for S. aureus  , minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) susceptibility testing of the isolate should be performed using a standardized procedure, and diagnostic evaluation of the patient should be performed to rule out sequestered foci of infection. Appropriate surgical intervention (e.g., debridement, removal of prosthetic devices, valve replacement surgery) and/or consideration of a change in antibacterial regimen may be required.



 Failure of treatment due to persisting or relapsing S. aureus  bacteremia/endocarditis may be due to reduced daptomycin susceptibility (as evidenced by increasing MIC of the S. aureus  isolate) [see  Clinical Studies (14.2)  ].  



    5.8 Decreased Efficacy in Patients with Moderate Baseline Renal Impairment



  Limited data are available from the two Phase 3 complicated skin and skin structure infection (cSSSI) trials regarding clinical efficacy of CUBICIN treatment in adult patients with creatinine clearance (CLCR) &lt;50 mL/min; only 31/534 (6%) patients treated with CUBICIN in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population had a baseline CLCR&lt;50 mL/min. Table 5 shows the number of adult patients by renal function and treatment group who were clinical successes in the Phase 3 cSSSI trials.

 50-70 mL/min                                   25/38 (66%)                        30/48 (63%)              
 30-&lt;50 mL/min                                  7/15 (47%)                         20/35 (57%)              
         In a subgroup analysis of the ITT population in the Phase 3 S. aureus  bacteremia/endocarditis trial, clinical success rates, as determined by a treatment-blinded Adjudication Committee [see  Clinical Studies (14.2)  ]  , in the CUBICIN-treated adult patients were lower in patients with baseline CLCR&lt;50 mL/min (see  Table 6  ). A decrease of the magnitude shown in Table 6 was not observed in comparator-treated patients.

 50-80 mL/min              12/26 (46%)            1/4 (25%)            13/31 (42%)            1/2 (50%)         
 30-&lt;50 mL/min              2/14 (14%)             0/1 (0%)             7/17 (41%)            1/1 (100%)        
           Consider these data when selecting antibacterial therapy for use in adult patients with baseline moderate to severe renal impairment.
 

    5.9 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions



  Clinically relevant plasma concentrations of daptomycin have been observed to cause a significant concentration-dependent false prolongation of prothrombin time (PT) and elevation of International Normalized Ratio (INR) when certain recombinant thromboplastin reagents are utilized for the assay [see  Drug Interactions (7.2)  ]  .



    5.10 Non-Susceptible Microorganisms



  The use of antibacterials may promote the overgrowth of non-susceptible microorganisms. If these infections occur during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken.



 Prescribing CUBICIN RF in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.
