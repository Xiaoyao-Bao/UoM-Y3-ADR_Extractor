  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect rates observed in clinical practice.



 The data described below reflect exposure to Unituxin at the recommended dose and schedule in 1021 patients with high-risk neuroblastoma enrolled in an open label, randomized (Study 1) or single arm clinical trials (Study 2 and Study 3). Prior to enrollment, patients received therapy consisting of induction combination chemotherapy, maximum feasible surgical resection, myeloablative consolidation chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplant, and radiation therapy to residual soft tissue disease. Patients received Unituxin in combination with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-2 (IL-2) and 13-cis-retinoic acid (RA). Treatment commenced within 95 days post autologous stem cell transplant in Study 1, within 210 days of autologous stem cell transplant in Study 2, and within 110 days of autologous stem cell transplant in Study 3.



     Study 1  



 In a randomized, open label, multi-center study (Study 1), 134 patients received dinutuximab in combination with GM-CSF, IL-2 and RA (Unituxin/RA group), including 109 randomized patients and 25 patients with biopsy-proven residual disease who were non-randomly assigned to receive dinutuximab. A total of 106 randomized patients received RA alone (RA group)  [see  Dosage and Administration (2)  and  Clinical Studies (14)  ]  . Patients had a median age at enrollment of 3.8 years (range: 0.94 to 15.3 years), and were predominantly male (60%) and White (82%). In Study 1, adverse reactions of Grade 3 or greater severity were comprehensively collected, but adverse reactions of Grade 1 or 2 severity were collected sporadically and laboratory data were not comprehensively collected.



 Approximately 71% of patients in the Unituxin/RA group and 77% of patients in the RA group completed planned treatment. The most common reason for premature discontinuation of study therapy was adverse reactions in the Unituxin/RA group (19%) and progressive disease (17%) in the RA group.



 The most common adverse drug reactions (&gt;= 25%) in the Unituxin/RA group were pain, pyrexia, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, infusion reactions, hypotension, hyponatremia, increased alanine aminotransferase, anemia, vomiting, diarrhea, hypokalemia, capillary leak syndrome, neutropenia, urticaria, hypoalbuminemia, increased aspartate aminotransferase, and hypocalcemia. The most common serious adverse reactions (&gt;= 5%) in the Unituxin/RA group were infections, infusion reactions, hypokalemia, hypotension, pain, fever, and capillary leak syndrome.



 Table 5 lists the adverse reactions reported in at least 10% of patients in the Unituxin/RA group for which there was a between group difference of at least 5% (all grades) or 2% (Grade 3 or greater severity).

 Study 2 was a single arm, multicenter expanded access trial that enrolled patients with high-risk neuroblastoma (N=783). The reported adverse event profile of dinutuximab in Study 2 was similar to that observed in Study 1.



 Study 3 was a multicenter, single arm safety study of dinutuximab in combination with GM-CSF, IL-2 and RA. In Study 3, adverse events of all CTCAE grades and laboratory data were systematically and comprehensively collected. Of 104 patients enrolled and treated in Study 3, 77% of patients completed study therapy. In general, the adverse reaction profile of dinutuximab observed in Study 3 was similar to that observed in Study 1 and Study 2. The following adverse reactions not previously reported in Study 1 were reported in at least 10% of patients in Study 3: nasal congestion (20%) and wheezing (15%). Table 7 provides the per-patient incidence of laboratory abnormalities in Study 3.

           6.2 Immunogenicity
   As with all therapeutic proteins, patients treated with Unituxin may develop anti-drug antibodies. In clinical studies, 52 of 284 (18%) patients from Study 2 and 13 of 103 (13%) patients from Study 3 tested positive for anti-dinutuximab binding antibodies. Neutralizing antibodies were detected in 3.6% of patients who were tested for anti-dinutuximab binding antibodies in Study 2 and Study 3. However, due to the limitations of the assay, the incidence of neutralizing antibodies may not have been reliably determined.



 The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of incidence of antibodies to Unituxin with the incidences of antibodies to other products may be misleading.



   6.3 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Unituxin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 *  Neurotoxicity: prolonged urinary retention, transverse myelitis, and reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ] .

   5.1 Serious Infusion Reactions



  Serious infusion reactions requiring urgent intervention including blood pressure support, bronchodilator therapy, corticosteroids, infusion rate reduction, infusion interruption, or permanent discontinuation of Unituxin included facial and upper airway edema, dyspnea, bronchospasm, stridor, urticaria, and hypotension. Infusion reactions generally occurred during or within 24 hours of completing the Unituxin infusion. Due to overlapping signs and symptoms, it was not possible to distinguish between infusion reactions and hypersensitivity reactions in some cases.



 In Study 1, Severe (Grade 3 or 4) infusion reactions occurred in 35 (26%) patients in the Unituxin/13-cis-retinoic acid (RA) group compared to 1 (1%) patient receiving RA alone. Severe urticaria occurred in 17 (13%) patients in the Unituxin/RA group but did not occur in the RA group. Serious adverse reactions consistent with anaphylaxis and resulting in permanent discontinuation of Unituxin occurred in 2 (1%) patients in the Unituxin/RA group. Additionally, 1 (0.1%) patient had multiple cardiac arrests and died within 24 hours after having received Unituxin in Study 2.



 Prior to each Unituxin dose, administer required intravenous hydration and premedication with antihistamines, analgesics, and antipyretics [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  . Monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of infusion reactions during and for at least 4 hours following completion of each Unituxin infusion in a setting where cardiopulmonary resuscitation medication and equipment are available.



 For mild to moderate infusion reactions such as transient rash, fever, rigors, and localized urticaria that respond promptly to antihistamines or antipyretics, decrease the Unituxin infusion rate and monitor closely. Immediately interrupt or permanently discontinue Unituxin and institute supportive management for severe or prolonged infusion reactions. Permanently discontinue Unituxin and institute supportive management for life-threatening infusion reactions [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .



    5.2 Neurotoxicity



   Pain  



 In Study 1, 114 (85%) patients treated in the Unituxin/RA group experienced pain despite pre-treatment with analgesics including morphine sulfate infusion. Severe (Grade 3) pain occurred in 68 (51%) patients in the Unituxin/RA group compared to 5 (5%) patients in the RA group. Pain typically occurred during the Unituxin infusion and was most commonly reported as abdominal pain, generalized pain, extremity pain, back pain, neuralgia, musculoskeletal chest pain, and arthralgia.



 Premedicate with analgesics including intravenous opioids prior to each dose of Unituxin and continue analgesics until two hours following completion of Unituxin [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  .



 For severe pain, decrease the Unituxin infusion rate to 0.875 mg/m  2  /hour. Discontinue Unituxin if pain is not adequately controlled despite infusion rate reduction and institution of maximum supportive measures [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .



    Peripheral Neuropathy  



 In Study 1, severe (Grade 3) peripheral sensory neuropathy occurred in 2 (1%) patients and severe peripheral motor neuropathy occurred in 2 (1%) patients in the Unituxin/RA group. No patients treated with RA alone experienced severe peripheral neuropathy. The duration and reversibility of peripheral neuropathy occurring in Study 1 was not documented. In Study 3, no patients experienced peripheral motor neuropathy. Among the 9 (9%) patients who experienced peripheral sensory neuropathy of any severity, the median (min, max) duration of peripheral sensory neuropathy was 9 (3, 163) days.



 In a study of a related anti-GD2 antibody conducted in 12 adult patients with metastatic melanoma, 2 (13%) patients developed severe motor neuropathy. One patient developed lower extremity weakness and inability to ambulate that persisted for approximately 6 weeks. Another patient developed severe lower extremity weakness resulting in an inability to ambulate without assistance that lasted for approximately 16 weeks and neurogenic bladder that lasted for approximately 3 weeks. Complete resolution of motor neuropathy was not documented in this case.



 Permanently discontinue Unituxin in patients with peripheral motor neuropathy of Grade 2 or greater severity, Grade 3 sensory neuropathy that interferes with daily activities for more than 2 weeks, or Grade 4 sensory neuropathy [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .



    Neurological Disorders of the Eye  



 Neurological disorders of the eye experienced by two or more patients treated with Unituxin in Studies 1, 2, or 3 included blurred vision, photophobia, mydriasis, fixed or unequal pupils, optic nerve disorder, eyelid ptosis, and papilledema.



 In Study 1, 3 (2%) patients in the Unituxin/RA group experienced blurred vision, compared to no patients in the RA group. Diplopia, mydriasis, and unequal pupillary size occurred in 1 patient each in the Unituxin/RA group, compared to no patients in the RA group. The duration of eye disorders occurring in Study 1 was not documented. In Study 3, eye disorders occurred in 16 (15%) patients, and in 3 (3%) patients resolution of the eye disorder was not documented. Among the cases with documented resolution, the median duration of eye disorders was 4 days (range: 0, 221 days).



 Interrupt Unituxin in patients experiencing dilated pupil with sluggish light reflex or other visual disturbances that do not cause visual loss. Upon resolution and if continued treatment with Unituxin is warranted, decrease the Unituxin dose by 50%. Permanently discontinue Unituxin in patients with recurrent signs or symptoms of an eye disorder following dose reduction and in patients who experience loss of vision [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .



     Prolonged Urinary Retention    



  Urinary retention that persists for weeks to months following discontinuation of opioids has occurred in patients treated with Unituxin. Permanently discontinue Unituxin in patients with urinary retention that does not resolve following discontinuation of opioids [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  and  Postmarketing Experience (6.3)  ]  .  



     Transverse Myelitis    



  Transverse myelitis has occurred in patients treated with Unituxin. Promptly evaluate any patient with signs or symptoms of transverse myelitis such as weakness, paresthesia, sensory loss, or incontinence. Permanently discontinue Unituxin in patients who develop transverse myelitis [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  and  Postmarketing Experience (6.3)  ].    



     Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome    



  Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS) has occurred in patients treated with Unituxin. Institute appropriate medical treatment and permanently discontinue Unituxin in patients with signs and symptoms of RPLS (e.g., severe headache, hypertension, visual changes, lethargy, or seizures) [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  and  Postmarketing Experience (6.3)  ]  .  



    5.3 Capillary Leak Syndrome



  In Study 1, severe (Grade 3 to 5) capillary leak syndrome occurred in 31 (23%) patients in the Unituxin/RA group and in no patients treated with RA alone. Additionally, capillary leak syndrome was reported as a serious adverse reaction in 9 (6%) patients in the Unituxin/RA group and in no patients treated with RA alone. Immediately interrupt or discontinue Unituxin and institute supportive management in patients with symptomatic or severe capillary leak syndrome [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .



    5.4 Hypotension



  In Study 1, severe (Grade 3 or 4) hypotension occurred in 22 (16%) patients in the Unituxin/RA group compared to no patients in the RA group.



 Prior to each Unituxin infusion, administer required intravenous hydration. Closely monitor blood pressure during Unituxin treatment. Immediately interrupt or discontinue Unituxin and institute supportive management in patients with symptomatic hypotension, systolic blood pressure (SBP) less than lower limit of normal for age, or SBP that is decreased by more than 15% compared to baseline [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2  ,  2.3)  ]  .



    5.5 Infection



  In Study 1, severe (Grade 3 or 4) bacteremia requiring intravenous antibiotics or other urgent intervention occurred in 17 (13%) patients in the Unituxin/RA group compared to 5 (5%) patients treated with RA alone. Sepsis occurred in 24 (18%) patients in the Unituxin/RA group and in 10 (9%) patients in the RA group.



 Monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of systemic infection and temporarily discontinue Unituxin in patients who develop systemic infection until resolution of the infection [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .



    5.6 Bone Marrow Suppression



  In Study 1, severe (Grade 3 or 4) thrombocytopenia (39% vs. 25%), anemia (34% vs. 16%), neutropenia (34% vs. 13%), and febrile neutropenia (4% vs. 0 patients) occurred more commonly in patients in the Unituxin/RA group compared to patients treated with RA alone. Monitor peripheral blood counts closely during therapy with Unituxin.



    5.7 Electrolyte Abnormalities



  Electrolyte abnormalities occurring in at least 25% of patients who received Unituxin/RA in Study 1 included hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypocalcemia. Severe (Grade 3 or 4) hypokalemia and hyponatremia occurred in 37% and 23% of patients in the Unituxin/RA group respectively compared to 2% and 4% of patients in the RA group. In a study of a related anti-GD2 antibody conducted in 12 adult patients with metastatic melanoma, 2 (13%) patients developed syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion resulting in severe hyponatremia. Monitor serum electrolytes daily during therapy with Unituxin.



    5.8 Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome



  Hemolytic uremic syndrome in the absence of documented infection and resulting in renal insufficiency, electrolyte abnormalities, anemia, and hypertension occurred in two patients enrolled in Study 2 following receipt of the first cycle of dinutuximab. Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome recurred following rechallenge with Unituxin in one patient. Permanently discontinue Unituxin and institute supportive management for signs of hemolytic uremic syndrome.



    5.9 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  Based on its mechanism of action, Unituxin may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment, and for two months after the last dose of Unituxin [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1  ,  8.3)  and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)  ].
