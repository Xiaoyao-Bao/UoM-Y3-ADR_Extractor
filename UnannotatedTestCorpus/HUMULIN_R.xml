  Hypoglycemia

  Hypoglycemia is one of the most frequent adverse events experienced by insulin users.

 Symptoms of mild to moderate hypoglycemia may occur suddenly and can include:


 sweating                                           
                                                                                                         drowsiness

        Signs of severe hypoglycemia can include:
 


 disorientation                                     
                                                                                                         seizures                                           
                                                                                                          
 unconsciousness                                    
                                                                                                         coma                                               
                                                                                                          
 death                                              
                                                                                                                                                              
        Early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be different or less pronounced under certain conditions, such as long duration of diabetes, autonomic diabetic neuropathy, use of medications such as beta-adrenergic blockers, changing insulin preparations, or intensified control (3 or more insulin injections per day) of diabetes.
 

 Without recognition of early warning symptoms, the patient may not be able to take steps to avoid more serious hypoglycemia. Patients who experience hypoglycemia without early warning symptoms should monitor their blood glucose more frequently, especially prior to activities such as driving. Mild to moderate hypoglycemia may be treated by eating foods or taking drinks that contain sugar. Patients should always carry a quick source of sugar, such as hard candy, non-diet carbohydrate-containing drinks or glucose tablets.

   Hypokalemia

    See    Precautions  

   Lipodystrophy

  Administration of insulin subcutaneously can result in lipoatrophy (depression in the skin) or lipohypertrophy (enlargement or thickening of tissue).

   Allergy

    Local Allergy  - Patients occasionally experience erythema, local edema, and pruritus at the site of injection. This condition usually is self-limiting. In some instances, this condition may be related to factors other than insulin, such as irritants in the skin cleansing agent or poor injection technique.

     Systemic Allergy  - Less common, but potentially more serious, is generalized allergy to insulin, which may cause rash over the whole body, shortness of breath, wheezing, reduction in blood pressure, fast pulse, or sweating. Severe cases of generalized allergy (anaphylaxis) may be life threatening.

   Weight Gain

  Weight gain can occur with some insulin therapies and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glycosuria.

   Peripheral Edema

  Insulin may cause sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy.

   Drug Interactions

  A number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require insulin dose adjustment and particularly close monitoring.

 Drugs that may increase the blood-glucose-lowering effect of Humulin R U-100 and susceptibility to hypoglycemia:

 *  Oral antihyperglycemic agents, salicylates, sulfa antibiotics, certain antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]), pramlintide, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, propoxyphene, pentoxifylline, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blocking agents, beta-adrenergic blockers, inhibitors of pancreatic function (e.g., octreotide), and alcohol. 
    Drugs that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect:
 

 *  Corticosteroids, isoniazid, certain lipid-lowering drugs (e.g., niacin), estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenothiazines, danazol, diuretics, sympathomimetic agents, somatropin, atypical antipsychotics, glucagon, protease inhibitors and thyroid replacement therapy. 
    Drugs that may increase or decrease blood-glucose-lowering effect:
 

 *  Beta-adrenergic blockers, clonidine, lithium salts, and alcohol. 
 *  Pentamidine may cause hypoglycemia, which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycemia. 
    Drugs that may mask the signs of hypoglycemia:
 

 *  Beta-adrenergic blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine.

   Hypoglycemia

  Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction of all insulin therapies, including Humulin R U-100. Severe hypoglycemia may lead to unconsciousness and/or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or death. Severe hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person and/or parenteral glucose infusion or glucagon administration has been observed in clinical trials with insulin, including trials with Humulin R U-100.

 As with all insulin preparations, the time course of Humulin R U-100 action may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and is dependent on dose, site of injection, blood supply, temperature, and physical activity.

 Adjustment of dosage of any insulin may be necessary if patients change their physical activity or their usual meal plan. Insulin requirements may be altered during illness, emotional disturbances, or other stresses. Concomitant antihyperglycemic agents may need to be adjusted.

 The timing of hypoglycemia usually reflects the time-action profile of the administered insulin formulations. Other factors such as changes in food intake (e.g., amount of food or timing of meals), injection site, exercise, and concomitant medications may also alter the risk of hypoglycemia (s ee    PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions  ).

 As with all insulins, use caution in patients with hypoglycemia unawareness and in patients who may be predisposed to hypoglycemia (e.g., the pediatric population and patients who fast or have erratic food intake). The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycemia. This may present a risk in situations where these abilities are especially important, such as driving or operating other machinery.

    Hyperglycemia, Diabetic Ketoacidosis, and Hyperosmolar Non-Ketotic Syndrome

  Hyperglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, or hyperosmolar coma may develop if the patient takes less Humulin R U-100 than needed to control blood glucose levels. This could be due to increases in insulin demand during illness or infection, neglect of diet, omission or improper administration of prescribed insulin doses or use of drugs that affect glucose metabolism or insulin sensitivity. Early signs of diabetic ketoacidosis include glycosuria and ketonuria. Polydipsia, polyuria, loss of appetite, fatigue, dry skin, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting and compensatory tachypnea come on gradually, usually over a period of some hours or days, in conjunction with hyperglycemia and ketonemia. Severe sustained hyperglycemia may result in hyperosmolar coma or death.

    Hypokalemia

  Insulin stimulates potassium movement into the cells, possibly leading to hypokalemia, that left untreated may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Since intravenously administered insulin has a rapid onset of action, increased attention to hypokalemia is necessary. Therefore, potassium levels must be monitored closely when Humulin R U-100 or any other insulin is administered intravenously. Use caution in patients who may be at risk for hypokalemia (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentrations).

    Hypersensitivity and Allergic Reactions

  Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulin products, including Humulin R U-100 ( see    ADVERSE REACTIONS  ).

 Localized reactions and generalized myalgias have been reported with the use of metacresol as an injectable excipient.

    Renal or Hepatic Impairment

  Frequent glucose monitoring and insulin dose reduction may be required in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.

    Drug Interactions

  Some medications may alter insulin requirements and the risk for hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia ( see    ADVERSE REACTIONS, Drug Interactions  ).

    Use in Pregnancy

  Pregnancy Category B. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, miscarriage, or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure. This background risk is increased in pregnancies complicated by hyperglycemia and is decreased with good glucose control. It is important for patients to maintain good control of diabetes before conception and during pregnancy. Special attention should be paid to diet, exercise and insulin regimens. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester, usually increase during the second and third trimesters, and rapidly decline after delivery. Careful monitoring is essential in these patients. Female patients should be advised to tell their physician if they intend to become, or if they become pregnant.

 Studies show that endogenous insulin only crosses the placenta in minimal amounts. While there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, an extensive body of published literature demonstrates the maternal and fetal benefits of insulin treatment in patients with diabetes during pregnancy. Humulin R is a recombinant human insulin that is identical to the endogenous hormone; therefore, reproduction and fertility studies were not performed in animals.

    Labor and Delivery

  Careful glucose monitoring and management of patients with diabetes during labor and delivery are required.

    Nursing Mothers

  Endogenous insulin is present in human milk. Insulin orally ingested is degraded in the gastrointestinal tract. No adverse reactions have been associated with infant exposure to insulin through the consumption of human milk. In a study of eight preterm infants between 26 to 30 weeks gestation, enteral administration of Humulin R did not result in hypoglycemia. Good glucose control supports lactation in patients with diabetes. Patients with diabetes who are lactating may require adjustments in insulin dose and/or diet.

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings">   WARNINGS

   Needles or syringes must never be reused or shared between patients. Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens.  

  Any change in insulin should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision. Changes in insulin strength, manufacturer, type (e.g., regular, NPH, analog, etc.), species, or method of administration may result in the need for a change in dosage.  

    Fluid retention and heart failure with concomitant use of PPAR-gamma agonists:  Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including Humulin R U-100, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered.
