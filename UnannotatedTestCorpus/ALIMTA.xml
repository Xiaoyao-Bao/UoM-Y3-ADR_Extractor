  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates cannot be directly compared to rates in other clinical trials and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 In clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions (incidence &gt;=20%) of ALIMTA, when administered as a single agent, are fatigue, nausea, and anorexia. The most common adverse reactions (incidence &gt;=20%) of ALIMTA, when administered in combination with cisplatin are vomiting, neutropenia, anemia, stomatitis/pharyngitis, thrombocytopenia, and constipation.



     Non-Squamous NSCLC  



     Initial Treatment in Combination with Cisplatin  



 The safety of ALIMTA was evaluated in Study JMDB, a randomized (1:1), open-label, multicenter trial conducted in chemotherapy-naive patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Patients received either ALIMTA 500 mg/m  2  intravenously and cisplatin 75 mg/m  2  intravenously on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle (n=839) or gemcitabine 1250 mg/m  2  intravenously on Days 1 and 8 and cisplatin 75 mg/m  2  intravenously on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle (n=830). All patients were fully supplemented with folic acid and vitamin B12.



 Study JMDB excluded patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS of 2 or greater), uncontrolled third-space fluid retention, inadequate bone marrow reserve and organ function, or a calculated creatinine clearance less than 45 mL/min. Patients unable to stop using aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or unable to take folic acid, vitamin B12or corticosteroids were also excluded from the study.



 The data described below reflect exposure to ALIMTA plus cisplatin in 839 patients in Study JMDB. Median age was 61 years (range 26-83 years); 70% of patients were men; 78% were White,16% were Asian, 2.9% were Hispanic or Latino, 2.1% were Black or African American, and &lt;1% were other ethnicities; 36% had an ECOG PS 0. Patients received a median of 5 cycles of ALIMTA.



   Table 2  provides the frequency and severity of adverse reactions that occurred in &gt;=5% of 839 patients receiving ALIMTA in combination with cisplatin in Study JMDB. Study JMDB was not designed to demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in adverse reaction rates for ALIMTA, as compared to the control arm, for any specified adverse reaction listed in  Table 2  .

   Maintenance Treatment Following First-line Non-ALIMTA Containing Platinum-Based Chemotherapy  



 In Study JMEN, the safety of ALIMTA was evaluated in a randomized (2:1), placebo-controlled, multicenter trial conducted in patients with non-progressive locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC following four cycles of a first-line, platinum-based chemotherapy regimen. Patients received either ALIMTA 500 mg/m  2  or matching placebo intravenously every 21 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients in both study arms were fully supplemented with folic acid and vitamin B12.



 Study JMEN excluded patients with an ECOG PS of 2 or greater, uncontrolled third-space fluid retention, inadequate bone marrow reserve and organ function, or a calculated creatinine clearance less than 45 mL/min. Patients unable to stop using aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or unable to take folic acid, vitamin B12or corticosteroids were also excluded from the study.



 The data described below reflect exposure to ALIMTA in 438 patients in Study JMEN. Median age was 61 years (range 26-83 years), 73% of patients were men; 65% were White, 31% were Asian, 2.9% were Hispanic or Latino, and &lt;2% were other ethnicities; 39% had an ECOG PS 0. Patients received a median of 5 cycles of ALIMTA and a relative dose intensity of ALIMTA of 96%. Approximately half the patients (48%) completed at least six, 21-day cycles and 23% completed ten or more 21-day cycles of ALIMTA.



   Table 3  provides the frequency and severity of adverse reactions reported in &gt;=5% of the 438 ALIMTA-treated patients in Study JMEN.

     Maintenance Treatment Following First-line ALIMTA Plus Platinum Chemotherapy  



 The safety of ALIMTA was evaluated in PARAMOUNT, a randomized (2:1), placebo-controlled study conducted in patients with non-squamous NSCLC with non-progressive (stable or responding disease) locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC following four cycles of ALIMTA in combination with cisplatin as first-line therapy for NSCLC. Patients were randomized to receive ALIMTA 500 mg/m  2  or matching placebo intravenously on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients in both study arms received folic acid and vitamin B12supplementation.



 PARAMOUNT excluded patients with an ECOG PS of 2 or greater, uncontrolled third-space fluid retention, inadequate bone marrow reserve and organ function, or a calculated creatinine clearance less than 45 mL/min. Patients unable to stop using aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or unable to take folic acid, vitamin B12or corticosteroids were also excluded from the study.



 The data described below reflect exposure to ALIMTA in 333 patients in PARAMOUNT. Median age was 61 years (range 32 to 83 years); 58% of patients were men; 94% were White, 4.8% were Asian, and &lt;1% were Black or African American; 36% had an ECOG PS 0. The median number of maintenance cycles was 4 for ALIMTA and placebo arms. Dose reductions for adverse reactions occurred in 3.3% of patients in the ALIMTA arm and 0.6% in the placebo arm. Dose delays for adverse reactions occurred in 22% of patients in the ALIMTA arm and 16% in the placebo arm.

Patients received ALIMTA 500 mg/m  2  intravenously or docetaxel 75 mg/m  2  intravenously on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. All patients on the ALIMTA arm received folic acid and vitamin B12supplementation.



 Study JMEI excluded patients with an ECOG PS of 3 or greater, uncontrolled third-space fluid retention, inadequate bone marrow reserve and organ function, or a calculated creatinine clearance less than 45 mL/min. Patients unable to discontinue aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or unable to take folic acid, vitamin B12or corticosteroids were also excluded from the study.



 The data described below reflect exposure to ALIMTA in 265 patients in Study JMEI. Median age was 58 years (range 22 to 87 years); 73% of patients were men; 70% were White, 24% were Asian, 2.6% were Black or African American, 1.8% were Hispanic or Latino, and &lt;2% were other ethnicities; 19% had an ECOG PS 0.



   Table 5  provides the frequency and severity of adverse reactions reported in &gt;=5% of the 265 ALIMTA-treated patients in Study JMEI. Study JMEI is not designed to demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in adverse reaction rates for ALIMTA, as compared to the control arm, for any specified adverse reaction listed in the  Table 5  below.

     First-line Treatment of Non-squamous NSCLC, with Carboplatin and Pembrolizumab  



 The safety of ALIMTA administered with carboplatin and pembrolizumab was investigated in a randomized (1:1) open-label cohort in Study KEYNOTE-021. Patients with previously untreated, metastatic non-squamous NSCLC received ALIMTA with carboplatin and pembrolizumab (n=59) or ALIMTA with carboplatin alone (n=62). Patients with autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment; a medical condition that required immunosuppression; or who had received more than 30 Gy of thoracic radiation within the prior 26 weeks were ineligible  [see Clinical Studies (  14.1  )]  .



 The median number of cycles of ALIMTA was 11 (range, 1-24). The study population characteristics were: median age of 64 years (range: 37 to 80), 48% age 65 years or older, 39% Male, 87% White and 8% Asian, 97% with metastatic disease, and 12% with brain metastases.



 ALIMTA was discontinued for adverse reactions in 9% of patients. The most common adverse reaction resulting in discontinuation of ALIMTA (&gt;=2%) was acute kidney injury (3.4%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of ALIMTA occurred in 36% of patients; the most common (&gt;=2%) were fatigue (9%), neutrophil count decreased (9%), anemia (7%), dyspnea (3.4%), and pneumonitis (3.4%).



   Table 6  summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred in at least 20% of patients in KEYNOTE-021. KEYNOTE-021 was not designed to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in adverse reactions between study arms for any specified reaction listed in  Table 6  .

 The safety of ALIMTA was evaluated in Study JMCH, a randomized (1:1), single-blind study conducted in patients with MPM who had received no prior chemotherapy for MPM. Patients received ALIMTA 500 mg/m  2  intravenously in combination with cisplatin 75 mg/m  2  intravenously on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle or cisplatin 75 mg/m  2  intravenously on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle administered until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Safety was assessed in 226 patients who received at least one dose of ALIMTA in combination with cisplatin and 222 patients who received at least one dose of cisplatin alone. Among 226 patients who received ALIMTA in combination with cisplatin, 74% (n=168) received full supplementation with folic acid and vitamin B12during study therapy, 14% (n=32) were never supplemented, and 12% (n=26) were partially supplemented.



 Study JMCH excluded patients with Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) of less than 70, inadequate bone marrow reserve and organ function, or a calculated creatinine clearance less than 45 mL/min. Patients unable to stop using aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were also excluded from the study.



 The data described below reflect exposure to ALIMTA in 168 patients that were fully supplemented with folic acid and vitamin B12.Median age was 60 years (range 19 to 85 years); 82% were men; 92% were White, 5% were Hispanic or Latino, 3.0% were Asian, and &lt;1% were other ethnicities; 54% had KPS of 90-100. The median number of treatment cycles administered was 6 in the ALIMTA/cisplatin fully supplemented group and 2 in the ALIMTA/cisplatin never supplemented group. Patients receiving ALIMTA in the fully supplemented group had a relative dose intensity of 93% of the protocol-specified ALIMTA dose intensity. The most common adverse reaction resulting in dose delay was neutropenia.



   Table 8  provides the frequency and severity of adverse reactions &gt;=5% in the subgroup of ALIMTA-treated patients who were fully vitamin supplemented in Study JMCH. Study JMCH was not designed to demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in adverse reaction rates for ALIMTA, as compared to the control arm, for any specified adverse reaction listed in the table below.

   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ALIMTA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Blood and Lymphatic System  - immune-mediated hemolytic anemia



   Gastrointestinal  - colitis, pancreatitis



   General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions  - edema



   Injury, poisoning, and procedural complications  - radiation recall



   Respiratory  - interstitial pneumonitis



   Skin  - Serious and fatal bullous skin conditions, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Myelosuppression: Can cause severe bone marrow suppression resulting in cytopenia and an increased risk of infection. Do not administer ALIMTA when the absolute neutrophil count is less than 1500 cells/mm  3  and platelets are less than 100,000 cells/mm  3  . Initiate supplementation with oral folic acid and intramuscular vitamin B12to reduce the severity of hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity of ALIMTA. (  2.6  ,  5.1  ) 
 *  Renal Failure: Can cause severe, and sometimes fatal, renal failure. Do not administer when creatinine clearance is less than 45 mL/min. (  2.3  ,  5.2  ) 
 *  Bullous and Exfoliative Skin Toxicity: Permanently discontinue for severe and life-threatening bullous, blistering or exfoliating skin toxicity. (  5.3  ) 
 *  Interstitial Pneumonitis: Withhold for acute onset of new or progressive unexplained pulmonary symptoms. Permanently discontinue if pneumonitis is confirmed. (  5.4  ) 
 *  Radiation Recall: Can occur in patients who received radiation weeks to years previously; permanently discontinue for signs of radiation recall. (  5.5  ) 
 *  Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. (  5.7  ,  8.1  ,  8.3  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Myelosuppression and Increased Risk of Myelosuppression without Vitamin Supplementation



  ALIMTA can cause severe myelosuppression resulting in a requirement for transfusions and which may lead to neutropenic infection. The risk of myelosuppression is increased in patients who do not receive vitamin supplementation. In Study JMCH, incidences of Grade 3-4 neutropenia (38% versus 23%), thrombocytopenia (9% versus 5%), febrile neutropenia (9% versus 0.6%), and neutropenic infection (6% versus 0) were higher in patients who received ALIMTA plus cisplatin without vitamin supplementation as compared to patients who were fully supplemented with folic acid and vitamin B12prior to and throughout ALIMTA plus cisplatin treatment.



 Initiate supplementation with oral folic acid and intramuscular vitamin B12prior to the first dose of ALIMTA; continue vitamin supplementation during treatment and for 21 days after the last dose of ALIMTA to reduce the severity of hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity of ALIMTA [see Dosage and Administration (  2.4  )]  . Obtain a complete blood count at the beginning of each cycle. Do not administer ALIMTA until the ANC is at least 1500 cells/mm  3  and platelet count is at least 100,000 cells/mm  3  . Permanently reduce ALIMTA in patients with an ANC of less than 500 cells/mm  3  or platelet count of less than 50,000 cells/mm  3  in previous cycles [see Dosage and Administration (  2.6  )]  .



 In Studies JMDB and JMCH, among patients who received vitamin supplementation, incidence of Grade 3-4 neutropenia was 15% and 23%, the incidence of Grade 3-4 anemia was 6% and 4%, and incidence of Grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia was 4% and 5%, respectively. In Study JMCH, 18% of patients in the ALIMTA arm required red blood cell transfusions compared to 7% of patients in the cisplatin arm [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )].  In Studies JMEN, PARAMOUNT, and JMEI, where all patients received vitamin supplementation, incidence of Grade 3-4 neutropenia ranged from 3% to 5%, and incidence of Grade 3-4 anemia ranged from 3% to 5%.



    5.2 Renal Failure



  ALIMTA can cause severe, and sometimes fatal, renal toxicity. The incidences of renal failure in clinical studies in which patients received ALIMTA with cisplatin were: 2.1% in Study JMDB and 2.2% in Study JMCH. The incidence of renal failure in clinical studies in which patients received ALIMTA as a single agent ranged from 0.4% to 0.6% (Studies JMEN, PARAMOUNT, and JMEI [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . Determine creatinine clearance before each dose and periodically monitor renal function during treatment with ALIMTA. Withhold ALIMTA in patients with a creatinine clearance of less than 45 mL/minute [see Dosage and Administration (  2.3  )]  .



    5.3 Bullous and Exfoliative Skin Toxicity



  Serious and sometimes fatal, bullous, blistering and exfoliative skin toxicity, including cases suggestive of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome/Toxic epidermal necrolysis can occur with ALIMTA. Permanently discontinue ALIMTA for severe and life-threatening bullous, blistering or exfoliating skin toxicity.



    5.4 Interstitial Pneumonitis



  Serious interstitial pneumonitis, including fatal cases, can occur with ALIMTA treatment. Withhold ALIMTA for acute onset of new or progressive unexplained pulmonary symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, or fever pending diagnostic evaluation. If pneumonitis is confirmed, permanently discontinue ALIMTA.



    5.5 Radiation Recall



  Radiation recall can occur with ALIMTA in patients who have received radiation weeks to years previously. Monitor patients for inflammation or blistering in areas of previous radiation treatment. Permanently discontinue ALIMTA for signs of radiation recall.



    5.6 Increased Risk of Toxicity with Ibuprofen in Patients with Renal Impairment



  Exposure to ALIMTA is increased in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment who take concomitant ibuprofen, increasing the risks of adverse reactions of ALIMTA. In patients with creatinine clearances between 45 mL/min and 79 mL/min, avoid administration of ibuprofen for 2 days before, the day of, and 2 days following administration of ALIMTA. If concomitant ibuprofen use cannot be avoided, monitor patients more frequently for ALIMTA adverse reactions, including myelosuppression, renal, and gastrointestinal toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (  2.5  ), Drug Interactions (  7  ), and Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )]  .



    5.7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, ALIMTA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, intravenous administration of pemetrexed to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis was teratogenic, resulting in developmental delays and increased malformations at doses lower than the recommended human dose of 500 mg/m  2  . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ALIMTA and for 6 months after the final dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ALIMTA and for 3 months after the final dose [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  ,  8.3  ) and Clinical Pharmacology (  12.1  )]  .
