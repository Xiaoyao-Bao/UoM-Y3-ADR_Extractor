    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: NEPHROGENIC SYSTEMIC FIBROSIS

  WARNING: NEPHROGENIC SYSTEMIC FIBROSIS

    Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs)

increase the risk for NSF among patients with impaired elimination

of the drugs. Avoid use of GBCAs in these patients unless the diagnostic

information is essential and not available with non-contrasted MRI

or other modalities. NSF may result in fatal or debilitating systemic

fibrosis affecting the skin, muscle and internal organs.  



 *  The risk for NSF appears highest among patients with:chronic, severe kidney disease (GFR &lt;30 mL/min/1.73m2), oracute kidney injury. 
 *  Screen patients for acute kidney injury and other conditions that may reduce renal function. For patients at risk for chronically reduced renal function (e.g. age &gt; 60 years, hypertension or diabetes), estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) through laboratory testing. 
 *  For patients at highest risk for NSF, do not exceed the recommended ProHance dose and allow a sufficient period of time for elimination of the drug from the body prior to re-administration (see WARNINGS).

   General



  Diagnostic procedures that involve the use of contrast agents should be carried out under direction of a physician with the prerequisite training and a thorough knowledge of the procedure to be performed.



 Personnel trained in resuscitation techniques and resuscitation equipment should be available.



 The possibility of a reaction, including serious, life threatening, or fatal, anaphylactic or cardiovascular reactions, or other idiosyncratic reactions (see   ADVERSE REACTIONS    ), should always be considered, especially in those patients with a history of a known clinical hypersensitivity or a history of asthma or other allergic respiratory disorders.



 Gadoteridol is cleared from the body by glomerular filtration. The hepato-biliary enteric pathway of excretion has not been demonstrated with ProHance. Dose adjustments in renal or hepatic impairment have not been studied. Therefore, caution should be exercised in patients with either renal or hepatic impairment.



 In a patient with a history of grand mal seizure, the possibility to induce such a seizure by ProHance is unknown.



 When ProHance (Gadoteridol) Injection is to be injected using nondisposable equipment, scrupulous care should be taken to prevent residual contamination with traces of cleansing agents. After ProHance is drawn into a syringe, the solution should be used immediately.



 Repeat Procedures: Repeated procedures have not been studied. Sequential use during the same diagnostic session has only been studied in central nervous system use. (See   Pharmacokinetics    under   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY    and   Central Nervous System    under   DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION    ).



    Information for patients:



   General:  Patients scheduled to receive ProHance should be instructed to inform their physician if the patient;



 *  is pregnant or breast feeding 
 *  has anemia or diseases that affect the red blood cells 
 *  has a history of renal or hepatic disease, seizure, hemoglobinopathies, asthma or allergic respiratory diseases 
 *  has recently received a GBCA. 
     Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis:  GBCAs increase the risk for NSF among patients with impaired elimination of the drugs. To counsel patients at risk for NSF:
 

 *  Describe the clinical manifestations of NSF 
 *  Describe procedures to screen for the detection of renal impairment 
    Instruct the patients to contact their physician if they develop signs or symptoms of NSF following ProHance administration, such as burning, itching, swelling, scaling, hardening and tightening of the skin; red or dark patches on the skin; stiffness in joints with trouble moving, bending or straightening the arms, hands, legs or feet; pain in the hip bones or ribs; or muscle weakness.
 

  Gadolinium Retention:  Advise patients that gadolinium is retained for months or years in brain, bone, skin, and other organs in patients with normal renal function. The clinical consequences of retention are unknown. Retention depends on multiple factors and is greater following administration of linear GBCAs than following administration of macrocyclic GBCAs. (See   WARNINGS-Gadolinium Retention    ).

   Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis (NSF)



  Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) increase the risk for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) among patients with impaired elimination of the drugs. Avoid use of GBCAs among these patients unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrast enhanced MRI or other modalities. The GBCA-associated NSF risk appears highest for patients with chronic, severe kidney disease (GFR &lt;30 mL/min/1.73m  2  ) as well as patients with acute kidney injury. The risk appears lower for patients with chronic, moderate kidney disease (GFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73m  2  ) and little, if any, for patients with chronic, mild kidney disease (GFR 60-89 mL/min/1.73m  2  ). NSF may result in fatal or debilitating fibrosis affecting the skin, muscle and internal organs. Report any diagnosis of NSF following ProHance administration to Bracco Diagnostics (1-800-257-5181) or FDA (1-800-FDA-1088 or  www.fda.gov/medwatch  ).



 Screen patients for acute kidney injury and other conditions that may reduce renal function. Features of acute kidney injury consist of rapid (over hours to days) and usually reversible decrease in kidney function, commonly in the setting of surgery, severe infection, injury or drug-induced kidney toxicity. Serum creatinine levels and estimated GFR may not reliably assess renal function in the setting of acute kidney injury. For patients at risk for chronically reduced renal function (e.g., age &gt; 60 years, diabetes mellitus or chronic hypertension), estimate the GFR through laboratory testing.



 Among the factors that may increase the risk for NSF are repeated or higher than recommended doses of a GBCA and the degree of renal impairment at the time of exposure. Record the specific GBCA and the dose administered to a patient. For patients at highest risk for NSF, do not exceed the recommended ProHance dose and allow a sufficient period of time for elimination of the drug prior to re-administration. For patients receiving hemodialysis, physicians may consider the prompt initiation of hemodialysis following the administration of a GBCA in order to enhance the contrast agent's elimination. The usefulness of hemodialysis in the prevention of NSF is unknown (see   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY    and   DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION    ).



    Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)



  In patients with chronically reduced renal function, acute kidney injury requiring dialysis has occurred with the use of GBCAs. The risk of acute kidney injury may increase with increasing dose of the contrast agent; administer the lowest dose necessary for adequate imaging.



    Hypersensitivity Reactions



  Severe and fatal hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis have been observed with administration of gadolinium products, including ProHance. Patients with a history of allergy, drug reactions or other hypersensitivity-like disorders should be closely observed during the procedure and for several hours after drug administration. If a reaction occurs, stop ProHance and immediately begin appropriate therapy including resuscitation. (See   PRECAUTIONS - General    )



 Deoxygenated sickle erythrocytes have been shown in  in vitro   studies to align perpendicular to a magnetic field which may result in vaso-occlusive complications  in vivo  . The enhancement of magnetic moment by ProHance may possibly potentiate sickle erythrocyte alignment. ProHance in patients with sickle cell anemia and other hemoglobinopathies has not been studied.



 Patients with other hemolytic anemias have not been adequately evaluated following administration of ProHance to exclude the possibility of increased hemolysis.



    Gadolinium Retention



  Gadolinium is retained for months or years in several organs. The highest concentrations (nanomoles per gram of tissue) have been identified in the bone, followed by other organs (e.g. brain, skin, kidney, liver, and spleen). The duration of retention also varies by tissue and is longest in bone. Linear GBCAs cause more retention than macrocyclic GBCAs. At equivalent doses, gadolinium retention varies among the linear agents with Omniscan (gadodiamide) and Optimark (gadoversetamide) causing greater retention than other linear agents [Eovist (gadoxetate disodium), Magnevist (gadopentetate dimeglumine), MultiHance (gadobenate dimeglumine)]. Retention is lowest and similar among the macrocyclic GBCAs [Dotarem (gadoterate meglumine), Gadavist (gadobutrol), ProHance (gadoteridol)].



 Consequences of gadolinium retention in the brain have not been established. Pathologic and clinical consequences of GBCA administration and retention in skin and other organs have been established in patients with impaired renal function (See   WARNINGS-Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis    ). There are rare reports of pathologic skin changes in patients with normal renal function. Adverse events involving multiple organ systems have been reported in patients with normal renal function without an established causal link to gadolinium retention (See   ADVERSE REACTIONS    ).



 While clinical consequences of gadolinium retention have not been established in patients with normal renal function, certain patients might be at higher risk. These include patients requiring multiple lifetime doses, pregnant and pediatric patients, and patients with inflammatory conditions. Consider the retention characteristics of the agent when choosing a GBCA for these patients. Minimize repetitive GBCA imaging studies, particularly closely spaced studies when possible.
