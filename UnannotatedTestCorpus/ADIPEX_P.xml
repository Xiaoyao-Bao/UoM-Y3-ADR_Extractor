  The following adverse reactions are described, or described in greater detail, in other sections:



 *    Primary pulmonary hypertension [ see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  ) ] 
 *    Valvular heart disease [ see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  ) ] 
 *    Effect on the ability to engage in potentially hazardous tasks [ see Warnings and Precautions (  5.5  ) ] 
 *    Withdrawal effects following prolonged high dosage administration [ see Drug Abuse and Dependence (  9.3  ) ] 
    The following adverse reactions to phentermine have been identified:
 

   Cardiovascular  



 Primary pulmonary hypertension and/or regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, palpitation, tachycardia, elevation of blood pressure, ischemic events.



   Central Nervous System  



 Overstimulation, restlessness, dizziness, insomnia, euphoria, dysphoria, tremor, headache, psychosis.



   Gastrointestinal  



 Dryness of the mouth, unpleasant taste, diarrhea, constipation, other gastrointestinal disturbances.



   Allergic  



 Urticaria.



   Endocrine  



 Impotence, changes in libido.



   EXCERPT:   Adverse events have been reported in the cardiovascular, central nervous, gastrointestinal, allergic, and endocrine systems. (  6  )

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *    Coadministration with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (safety and efficacy of combination not established). (  5.1  ) 
 *    Rare cases of primary pulmonary hypertension have been reported. ADIPEX-P  (r)  should be discontinued in case of new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. (  5.2  ) 
 *    Rare cases of serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease have been reported. (  5.3  ) 
 *    Tolerance to the anorectic effect usually develops within a few weeks. If this occurs, ADIPEX-P  (r)  should be discontinued. The recommended dose should not be exceeded. (  5.4  ) 
 *    ADIPEX-P  (r)  may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. (  5.5  ) 
 *    Risk of abuse and dependence. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. (  5.6  ) 
 *    Concomitant alcohol use may result in an adverse drug reaction. (  5.7  ) 
 *    Use caution in patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure). (  5.8  ) 
 *    A reduction in dose of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication may be required in some patients. (  5.9  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Coadministration With Other Drug Products for Weight Loss



   ADIPEX-P  (r)  is indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with ADIPEX-P  (r)  and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of ADIPEX-P  (r)  and these drug products is not recommended.  



    5.2 Primary Pulmonary Hypertension



   Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) - a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs - has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of ADIPEX-P  (r)  alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone.  The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension.



    5.3 Valvular Heart Disease



   Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic and/or tricuspid valves, has been reported in otherwise healthy persons who had taken a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine in the etiology of these valvulopathies has not been established and their course in individuals after the drugs are stopped is not known. The possibility of an association between valvular heart disease and the use of ADIPEX-P  (r)  alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of valvular heart disease in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone.  



    5.4 Development of Tolerance, Discontinuation in Case of Tolerance



  When tolerance to the anorectant effect develops, the recommended dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect; rather, the drug should be discontinued.



    5.5 Effect on the Ability to Engage in Potentially Hazardous Tasks



  ADIPEX-P  (r)  may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly.



    5.6 Risk of Abuse and Dependence



  ADIPEX-P  (r)  is related chemically and pharmacologically to amphetamine (d- and d l  l-amphetamine) and to other related stimulant drugs that have been extensively abused. The possibility of abuse of ADIPEX-P  (r)  should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program. See Drug Abuse and Dependence (  9  )  and Overdosage (  10  )  .



 The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage.



    5.7 Usage With Alcohol



  Concomitant use of alcohol with ADIPEX-P  (r)  may result in an adverse drug reaction.



    5.8 Use in Patients With Hypertension



  Use caution in prescribing ADIPEX-P  (r)  for patients with even mild hypertension (risk of increase in blood pressure).



    5.9 Use in Patients on Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemic Medications for Diabetes Mellitus



  A reduction in insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in patients with diabetes mellitus may be required.
