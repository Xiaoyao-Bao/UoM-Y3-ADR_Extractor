  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 In two double-blind, vehicle-controlled clinical trials, 495 subjects were exposed to Ecoza topical foam or vehicle (246 subjects were exposed to Ecoza topical foam, 1% and 249 were exposed to vehicle). Subjects with interdigital tinea pedis applied foam or vehicle once daily for approximately 28 days. During clinical trials with Ecoza topical foam, the most common adverse reactions were application site reactions which occurred in less than 1% of subjects in both the Ecoza and vehicle arms.
