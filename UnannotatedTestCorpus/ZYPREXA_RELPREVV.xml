  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  The information below for ZYPREXA RELPREVV is derived primarily from a clinical trial database consisting of 2058 patients with approximately 1948 patient years of exposure to ZYPREXA RELPREVV. This database includes safety data from 6 open-label studies and 2 double-blind comparator studies, conducted in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Additionally, data obtained from patients treated with oral olanzapine are also presented below. Adverse reactions were assessed by the collection of adverse reactions, vital signs, weights, laboratory analytes, ECGs, and the results of physical and ophthalmologic examinations. In the tables and tabulations that follow for ZYPREXA RELPREVV, the MedDRA terminology has been used to classify reported adverse reactions. Data obtained from oral olanzapine studies was reported using the COSTART and MedDRA dictionaries.



 The stated frequencies of adverse reactions represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatment-emergent adverse reaction of the type listed. A reaction was considered treatment emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation. Reactions listed elsewhere in labeling may not be repeated below. The entire label should be read to gain a complete understanding of the safety profile of ZYPREXA RELPREVV.



 The prescriber should be aware that the figures in the tables and tabulations cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse reaction incidence in the population studied.



     Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment in a Short-Term, Placebo-Controlled Trial  



 Overall, there was no difference in the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions between ZYPREXA RELPREVV (4%; 13/306 patients) and placebo (5%; 5/98 patients) in an 8-week trial.



     Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions in a Short-Term, Placebo-Controlled Trial  



 In an 8-week trial, treatment-emergent adverse reactions with an incidence of 5% or greater in at least one of the ZYPREXA RELPREVV treatment groups (210 mg/2 weeks, 405 mg/4 weeks, or 300 mg/2 weeks) and greater than placebo were: headache, sedation, weight gain, cough, diarrhea, back pain, nausea, somnolence, dry mouth, nasopharyngitis, increased appetite, and vomiting.



     Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 2% or More among ZYPREXA RELPREVV-Treated Patients in a Short-Term, Placebo-Controlled Trial  



   Table 9  enumerates the incidence, rounded to the nearest percent, of treatment-emergent adverse reactions that occurred in 2% or more of patients treated with ZYPREXA RELPREVV and with incidence greater than placebo who participated in the 8-week, placebo-controlled trial.

 Dose group differences have been observed for weight, fasting triglycerides and prolactin elevation for ZYPREXA RELPREVV  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.7  ,  5.17  )]  .



 A dose group difference for oral olanzapine has been observed for fatigue, dizziness, weight gain and prolactin elevation. In a single 8-week randomized, double-blind, fixed-dose study comparing 10 (N=199), 20 (N=200) and 40 (N=200) mg/day of oral olanzapine in adult patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, incidence of fatigue (10 mg/day: 1.5%; 20 mg/day: 2.1%; 40 mg/day: 6.6%) was observed with significant differences between 10 vs 40 and 20 vs 40 mg/day. The incidence of dizziness (10 mg/day: 2.6%; 20 mg/day: 1.6%; 40 mg/day: 6.6%) was observed with significant differences between 20 vs 40 mg. Dose group differences were also noted for weight gain and prolactin elevation  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.7  ,  5.17  )]  .

             Dystonia, Class Effect:  Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, the frequency and severity are greater with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. In general, an elevated risk of acute dystonia may be observed in males and younger age groups receiving antipsychotics; however, events of dystonia have been reported infrequently (&lt;1%) with olanzapine use.
 

   6.3 Other Adverse Reactions

    Local Injection Site Reactions  



 Eleven ZYPREXA RELPREVV-treated patients (3.6%) and 0 placebo-treated patients experienced treatment-emergent injection-related adverse reactions (injection site pain, buttock pain, injection site mass, induration, injection site induration) in the placebo-controlled database. The most frequently occurring treatment-emergent adverse reaction was injection site pain (2.3% ZYPREXA RELPREVV-treated; 0% placebo-treated).



     Other Adverse Reactions Observed During the Clinical Trial Evaluation of Olanzapine for Extended-Release Injectable Suspension  



 Injection site abscess has been reported in clinical trials with ZYPREXA RELPREVV therapy. Isolated cases required surgical intervention.



     Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions During the Clinical Trial Evaluation of Oral Olanzapine  



 In clinical trials of oral olanzapine monotherapy for the treatment of schizophrenia in adult patients, treatment-emergent adverse reactions with an incidence of 5% or greater in the olanzapine treatment arm and at least twice that of placebo were: postural hypotension, constipation, weight gain, dizziness, personality disorder, and akathisia.



     Other Adverse Reactions Observed During the Clinical Trial Evaluation of Oral Olanzapine  



 Following is a list of treatment-emergent adverse reactions reported by patients treated with oral olanzapine (at multiple doses &gt;=1 mg/day) in clinical trials. This listing is not intended to include reactions (1) already listed in previous tables or elsewhere in labeling, (2) for which a drug cause was remote, (3) which were so general as to be uninformative, (4) which were not considered to have significant clinical implications, or (5) which occurred at a rate equal to or less than placebo. Reactions are classified by body system using the following definitions: frequent adverse reactions are those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse reactions are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients; rare adverse reactions are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients.



   Body as a Whole  -  Infrequent:   chills, face edema, photosensitivity reaction, suicide attempt  1  ;  Rare:   chills and fever, hangover effect, sudden death  1  .



   Cardiovascular System  -  Infrequent:   cerebrovascular accident, vasodilatation.



   Digestive System  -  Infrequent:   abdominal distension, nausea and vomiting, tongue edema;  Rare:   ileus, intestinal obstruction, liver fatty deposit.

     Vital Signs and Laboratory Studies  



     Laboratory Changes  



   ZYPREXA RELPREVV in Adults:  Statistically significant within group mean changes for ZYPREXA RELPREVV, which were also significantly different from placebo, were observed for the following: eosinophils, monocytes, cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides, and direct bilirubin. There were no statistically significant differences between ZYPREXA RELPREVV and placebo in the incidence of potentially clinically significant changes in any of the laboratory values studied.



 Statistically significant within group mean changes for ZYPREXA RELPREVV, which were also significantly different from oral olanzapine (in a 24-week double-blind study), were observed for the following: gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and sodium.



 From an analysis of the laboratory data in an integrated database of 41 completed clinical studies in adult patients treated with oral olanzapine, high GGT levels were recorded in &gt;=1% (88/5245) of patients.



 Statistically significant differences were observed between ZYPREXA RELPREVV and oral olanzapine for the incidence of treatment-emergent low platelet count (0% ZYPREXA RELPREVV vs 1% oral olanzapine); and low total bilirubin (2.8% ZYPREXA RELPREVV vs 0.7% for oral olanzapine). There was a statistically significant difference between ZYPREXA RELPREVV and oral olanzapine in potentially clinically significant changes for high leukocyte count (0% ZYPREXA RELPREVV vs 1% oral olanzapine).



 Changes in aminotransferases observed with ZYPREXA RELPREVV treatment were similar to those reported with ZYPREXA treatment. In placebo-controlled ZYPREXA RELPREVV studies, clinically significant ALT elevations (&gt;=3 times the upper limit of the normal range) were observed in 2.7% (8/291) of patients exposed to olanzapine compared to 3.2% (3/94) of the placebo patients. None of these patients experienced jaundice. In 3 of these patients, liver enzymes reverted to the normal range despite continued treatment, and in 5 cases enzymes values decreased, but were still above the normal range at the end of therapy.



 Within the larger premarketing ZYPREXA RELPREVV database of 1886 patients with baseline ALT &lt;=90 IU/L, the incidence of ALT elevation to &gt;200 IU/L was 0.8%. None of these patients experienced jaundice or other symptoms attributable to liver impairment and most had transient changes that tended to normalize while ZYPREXA RELPREVV treatment was continued.



 From an analysis of the laboratory data in an integrated database of 41 completed clinical studies in adult patients treated with oral olanzapine, elevated uric acid was recorded in &gt;=3% (171/4641) of patients.



   Olanzapine Monotherapy in Adults:  An assessment of the premarketing experience for oral olanzapine revealed an association with asymptomatic increases in ALT, AST, and GGT. Within the original premarketing database of about 2400 adult patients with baseline ALT &lt;=90 IU/L, the incidence of ALT elevations to &gt;200 IU/L was 2% (50/2381). None of these patients experienced jaundice or other symptoms attributable to liver impairment and most had transient changes that tended to normalize while olanzapine treatment was continued.



 In placebo-controlled oral olanzapine monotherapy studies in adults, clinically significant ALT elevations (change from &lt;3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] at baseline to &gt;=3 times ULN) were observed in 5% (77/1426) of patients exposed to olanzapine compared to 1% (10/1187) of patients exposed to placebo. ALT elevations &gt;=5 times ULN were observed in 2% (29/1438) of olanzapine-treated patients, compared to 0.3% (4/1196) of placebo-treated patients. ALT values returned to normal, or were decreasing, at last follow-up in the majority of patients who either continued treatment with olanzapine or discontinued olanzapine. No patient with elevated ALT values experienced jaundice, liver failure, or met the criteria for Hy's Rule.



 Caution should be exercised in patients with signs and symptoms of hepatic impairment, in patients with pre-existing conditions associated with limited hepatic functional reserve, and in patients who are being treated with potentially hepatotoxic drugs.



 Oral olanzapine administration was also associated with increases in serum prolactin  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.17  )]  , with an asymptomatic elevation of the eosinophil count in 0.3% of patients, and with an increase in CPK.



     ECG Changes  - Comparison of ZYPREXA RELPREVV and oral olanzapine, in a 24 week study, revealed no significant differences on ECG changes. Between-group comparisons for pooled placebo-controlled trials revealed no significant oral olanzapine/placebo differences in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially important changes in ECG parameters, including QT, QTc, and PR intervals. Oral olanzapine use was associated with a mean increase in heart rate of 2.4 beats per minute compared to no change among placebo patients. This slight tendency to tachycardia may be related to olanzapine's potential for inducing orthostatic changes  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.11  )]  .



   6.4 Postmarketing Experience

  Adverse reactions reported since market introduction that were temporally (but not necessarily causally) related to ZYPREXA therapy include the following: allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylactoid reaction, angioedema, pruritus or urticaria), cholestatic or mixed liver injury, diabetic coma, diabetic ketoacidosis, discontinuation reaction (diaphoresis, nausea, or vomiting), Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), hepatitis, jaundice, neutropenia, pancreatitis, priapism, rash, restless legs syndrome, rhabdomyolysis, stuttering  1  , and venous thromboembolic events (including pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis). Random cholesterol levels of &gt;=240 mg/dL and random triglyceride levels of &gt;=1000 mg/dL have been reported. Additionally, injection site abscess has been reported in postmarketing reports with ZYPREXA RELPREVV therapy. Isolated cases required surgical intervention.

    Post-Injection Delirium/Sedation Syndrome

    - Adverse events with signs and symptoms consistent with olanzapine overdose, in particular, sedation (including coma) and/or delirium, have been reported following injections of ZYPREXA RELPREVV. ZYPREXA RELPREVV must be administered in a registered healthcare facility with ready access to emergency response services. After each injection, patients must be observed at the healthcare facility by a healthcare professional for at least 3 hours. Because of this risk, ZYPREXA RELPREVV is available only through a restricted distribution program called ZYPREXA RELPREVV Patient Care Program and requires prescriber, healthcare facility, patient, and pharmacy enrollment

    [see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  ), Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  ,   5.2  ), Overdosage (  10.2  ), and Patient Counseling Information (  17.2  )]  .





     Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis

    - Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of seventeen placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. ZYPREXA RELPREVV is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis

   5.1 Post-Injection Delirium/Sedation Syndrome



  During premarketing clinical studies of ZYPREXA RELPREVV, adverse events that presented with signs and symptoms consistent with olanzapine overdose, in particular, sedation (including coma) and/or delirium, were reported in patients following an injection of ZYPREXA RELPREVV [see  Boxed Warning  and Dosage and Administration (  2.1  )]  . These events occurred in &lt;0.1% of injections and in approximately 2% of patients who received injections for up to 46 months. These events were correlated with an unintentional rapid increase in serum olanzapine concentrations to supra-therapeutic ranges in some cases. While a rapid and greater than expected increase in serum olanzapine concentration has been observed in some patients with these events, the exact mechanism by which the drug was unintentionally introduced into the blood stream is not known. Clinical signs and symptoms included dizziness, confusion, disorientation, slurred speech, altered gait, difficulty ambulating, weakness, agitation, extrapyramidal symptoms, hypertension, convulsion, and reduced level of consciousness ranging from mild sedation to coma. Time after injection to event ranged from soon after injection to greater than 3 hours after injection. The majority of patients were hospitalized and some required supportive care, including intubation, in several cases. All patients had largely recovered by 72 hours. The risk of an event is the same at each injection, so the risk per patient is cumulative (i.e., increases with the number of injections) [see Overdosage (  10.1  )]  .



 Healthcare professionals are advised to discuss this potential risk with patients each time they prescribe and administer ZYPREXA RELPREVV [see Patient Counseling Information (  17.1  ,  17.2  )]  .



    5.2 Prescribing and Distribution Program for ZYPREXA RELPREVV



  ZYPREXA RELPREVV is available only through a restricted distribution program [see  Boxed Warning  , Indications and Usage (  1  ), and Patient Counseling Information (  17.2  )]  . ZYPREXA RELPREVV must not be dispensed directly to a patient. For a patient to receive treatment, the prescriber, healthcare facility, patient, and pharmacy must all be enrolled in the ZYPREXA RELPREVV Patient Care Program. To enroll, call 1-877-772-9390.



 ZYPREXA RELPREVV must be administered in a registered healthcare facility (such as a hospital, clinic, residential treatment center, or community healthcare center) with ready access to emergency response services. After each ZYPREXA RELPREVV injection, a healthcare professional must continuously observe the patient at the healthcare facility for at least 3 hours and must confirm that the patient is alert, oriented, and absent of any signs and symptoms of post-injection delirium/sedation syndrome prior to being released. All patients must be accompanied to their destination upon leaving the facility. For the remainder of the day of each injection, patients should not drive or operate heavy machinery, and should be advised to be vigilant for symptoms of post-injection delirium/sedation syndrome and be able to obtain medical assistance if needed. If post-injection delirium/sedation syndrome is suspected, close medical supervision and monitoring should be instituted in a facility capable of resuscitation [see Overdosage (  10  )]  . If parenteral benzodiazepines are required for patient management during an event of post-injection delirium/sedation syndrome, careful evaluation of clinical status for excessive sedation and cardiorespiratory depression is recommended.



    5.3 Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis



   Increased Mortality  



  Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. ZYPREXA RELPREVV is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis   [see  Boxed Warning  , Warnings and Precautions (  5.16  ), and Patient Counseling Information (  17.3  )]  .



 In placebo-controlled oral olanzapine clinical trials of elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis, the incidence of death in olanzapine-treated patients was significantly greater than placebo-treated patients (3.5% vs 1.5%, respectively).



    Cerebrovascular Adverse Events (CVAE), Including Stroke  



 Cerebrovascular adverse events (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities, were reported in patients in trials of oral olanzapine in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis. In placebo-controlled trials, there was a significantly higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with oral olanzapine compared to patients treated with placebo. ZYPREXA RELPREVV is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see  Boxed Warning  and Patient Counseling Information (  17.3  )]  .



    5.4 Suicide



  The possibility of a suicide attempt is inherent in schizophrenia, and close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany drug therapy.



    5.5 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)



  A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs, including olanzapine. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.



 The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to exclude cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever, and primary central nervous system pathology.



 The management of NMS should include: 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy; 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring; and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for NMS.



 If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered and tolerability with oral olanzapine should be established prior to initiating treatment with ZYPREXA RELPREVV [see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  )]  . The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported [see Patient Counseling Information (  17.4  )]  .



    5.6 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)



  Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) has been reported with olanzapine exposure. DRESS may present with a cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, fever, and/or lymphadenopathy with systemic complications such as hepatitis, nephritis, pneumonitis, myocarditis, and/or pericarditis. DRESS is sometimes fatal. Discontinue ZYPREXA RELPREVV if DRESS is suspected [see Patient Counseling Information (  17.5  )]  .



    5.7 Metabolic Changes



  Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes including hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and weight gain. Metabolic changes may be associated with increased cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk. Olanzapine's specific metabolic profile is presented below.



    Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus  



 Physicians should consider the risks and benefits when prescribing olanzapine to patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, or having borderline increased blood glucose level (fasting 100-126 mg/dL, nonfasting 140-200 mg/dL). Patients taking olanzapine should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients starting treatment with olanzapine should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug [see Patient Counseling Information (  17.6  )]  .



 Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics including olanzapine. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. While relative risk estimates are inconsistent, the association between atypical antipsychotics and increases in glucose levels appears to fall on a continuum and olanzapine appears to have a greater association than some other atypical antipsychotics.



 Mean increases in blood glucose have been observed in patients treated (median exposure of 9.2 months) with olanzapine in phase 1 of the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE). The mean increase of serum glucose (fasting and nonfasting samples) from baseline to the average of the 2 highest serum concentrations was 15.0 mg/dL.



 In a study of healthy volunteers, subjects who received olanzapine (N=22) for 3 weeks had a mean increase compared to baseline in fasting blood glucose of 2.3 mg/dL. Placebo-treated subjects (N=19) had a mean increase in fasting blood glucose compared to baseline of 0.34 mg/dL.



    Olanzapine Monotherapy in Adults  - In an analysis of 5 placebo-controlled adult olanzapine monotherapy studies with a median treatment duration of approximately 3 weeks, olanzapine was associated with a greater mean change in fasting glucose levels compared to placebo (2.76 mg/dL versus 0.17 mg/dL). The difference in mean changes between olanzapine and placebo was greater in patients with evidence of glucose dysregulation at baseline (patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus or related adverse reactions, patients treated with anti-diabetic agents, patients with a baseline random glucose level &gt;=200 mg/dL, and/or a baseline fasting glucose level &gt;=126 mg/dL).



 Olanzapine-treated patients had a greater mean HbA1cincrease from baseline of 0.04% (median exposure 21 days), compared to a mean HbA1cdecrease of 0.06% in placebo-treated subjects (median exposure 17 days).



 In an analysis of 8 placebo-controlled studies (median treatment exposure 4-5 weeks), 6.1% of olanzapine-treated subjects (N=855) had treatment-emergent glycosuria compared to 2.8% of placebo-treated subjects (N=599).  Table 2  shows short-term and long-term changes in fasting glucose levels from adult olanzapine monotherapy studies.

    Olanzapine Monotherapy in Adolescents  - The safety and efficacy of ZYPREXA RELPREVV have not been established in patients under the age of 18 years.



 In an analysis of 3 placebo-controlled oral olanzapine monotherapy studies of adolescent patients (13-17 years), including those with schizophrenia (6 weeks) or bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes) (3 weeks), olanzapine was associated with a greater mean change from baseline in fasting glucose levels compared to placebo (2.68 mg/dL versus -2.59 mg/dL). The mean change in fasting glucose for adolescents exposed at least 24 weeks was 3.1 mg/dL (N=121).  Table 3  shows short-term and long-term changes in fasting blood glucose from adolescent oral olanzapine monotherapy studies.

 Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed with olanzapine use. Clinical monitoring, including baseline and periodic follow-up lipid evaluations in patients using olanzapine, is recommended [see Patient Counseling Information (  17.7  )]  .



 Clinically significant, and sometimes very high (&gt;500 mg/dL), elevations in triglyceride levels have been observed with olanzapine use. Modest mean increases in total cholesterol have also been seen with olanzapine use.



  Olanzapine Monotherapy in Adults  - In an analysis of 5 placebo-controlled olanzapine monotherapy studies with treatment duration up to 12 weeks, olanzapine-treated patients had increases from baseline in mean fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides of 5.3 mg/dL, 3.0 mg/dL, and 20.8 mg/dL respectively compared to decreases from baseline in mean fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides of 6.1 mg/dL, 4.3 mg/dL, and 10.7 mg/dL for placebo-treated patients. For fasting HDL cholesterol, no clinically meaningful differences were observed between olanzapine-treated patients and placebo-treated patients. Mean increases in fasting lipid values (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides) were greater in patients without evidence of lipid dysregulation at baseline, where lipid dysregulation was defined as patients diagnosed with dyslipidemia or related adverse reactions, patients treated with lipid lowering agents, or patients with high baseline lipid levels.



 In long-term studies (at least 48 weeks), patients had increases from baseline in mean fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides of 5.6 mg/dL, 2.5 mg/dL, and 18.7 mg/dL, respectively, and a mean decrease in fasting HDL cholesterol of 0.16 mg/dL. In an analysis of patients who completed 12 months of therapy, the mean nonfasting total cholesterol did not increase further after approximately 4-6 months.



 The proportion of patients who had changes (at least once) in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol or triglycerides from normal or borderline to high, or changes in HDL cholesterol from normal or borderline to low, was greater in long-term studies (at least 48 weeks) as compared with short-term studies.

 Dose group differences with respect to increases in fasting triglycerides have been observed. In a 24-week randomized, double-blind, fixed-dose study with ZYPREXA RELPREVV, statistically significant differences among dose groups have been observed for fasting triglycerides. Incidence of changes from normal to high levels of fasting triglycerides at any time during the trial indicated significant differences between the highest dose group (300 mg/2 weeks, 24.5% [13/53]) and the lower dose groups (150 mg/2 weeks, 6.5% [4/62]; 405 mg/4 weeks, 9.8% [13/133]).



    Olanzapine Monotherapy in Adolescents  - The safety and efficacy of ZYPREXA RELPREVV have not been established in patients under the age of 18 years.



 In an analysis of 3 placebo-controlled oral olanzapine monotherapy studies of adolescents (13-17 years), including those with schizophrenia (6 weeks) or bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes) (3 weeks), olanzapine-treated adolescents had increases from baseline in mean fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides of 12.9 mg/dL, 6.5 mg/dL, and 28.4 mg/dL, respectively, compared to increases from baseline in mean fasting total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol of 1.3 mg/dL and 1.0 mg/dL, and a decrease in triglycerides of 1.1 mg/dL for placebo-treated adolescents. For fasting HDL cholesterol, no clinically meaningful differences were observed between olanzapine-treated adolescents and placebo-treated adolescents.



 In long-term studies (at least 24 weeks), adolescents had increases from baseline in mean fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides of 5.5 mg/dL, 5.4 mg/dL, and 20.5 mg/dL, respectively, and a mean decrease in fasting HDL cholesterol of 4.5 mg/dL.

                Weight Gain  
 

 Potential consequences of weight gain should be considered prior to starting olanzapine. Patients receiving olanzapine should receive regular monitoring of weight [see Patient Counseling Information (  17.8  )]  .



    Olanzapine Monotherapy in Adults  - In an analysis of 13 placebo-controlled olanzapine monotherapy studies, olanzapine-treated patients gained an average of 2.6 kg (5.7 lb) compared to an average 0.3 kg (0.6 lb) weight loss in placebo-treated patients with a median exposure of 6 weeks; 22.2% of olanzapine-treated patients gained at least 7% of their baseline weight, compared to 3% of placebo-treated patients, with a median exposure to event of 8 weeks; 4.2% of olanzapine-treated patients gained at least 15% of their baseline weight, compared to 0.3% of placebo-treated patients, with a median exposure to event of 12 weeks. Clinically significant weight gain was observed across all baseline Body Mass Index (BMI) categories. Discontinuation due to weight gain occurred in 0.2% of olanzapine-treated patients and in 0% of placebo-treated patients.



 In long-term studies (at least 48 weeks), the mean weight gain was 5.6 kg (12.3 lb) (median exposure of 573 days, N=2021). The percentages of patients who gained at least 7%, 15%, or 25% of their baseline body weight with long-term exposure were 64%, 32%, and 12%, respectively. Discontinuation due to weight gain occurred in 0.4% of olanzapine-treated patients following at least 48 weeks of exposure.



   Table 6  includes data on adult weight gain with olanzapine pooled from 86 clinical trials. The data in each column represent data for those patients who completed treatment periods of the durations specified.

            Dose group differences with respect to weight gain have been observed in some studies. In a 24-week randomized, double-blind, fixed-dose study with ZYPREXA RELPREVV, mean baseline-to-endpoint increase in weight (150 mg/2 weeks, n=140: 0.67 kg; 405 mg/4 weeks, n=315: 0.89 kg; 300 mg/2 weeks, n=140: 1.70 kg) was observed with significant differences between the lowest and highest dose groups (150 vs 300 mg/2 weeks). In a single 8-week randomized, double-blind, fixed-dose study comparing 10 (N=199), 20 (N=200) and 40 (N=200) mg/day of oral olanzapine in adult patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, mean baseline to endpoint increase in weight (10 mg/day: 1.9 kg; 20 mg/day: 2.3 kg; 40 mg/day: 3 kg) was observed with significant differences between 10 vs 40 mg/day.
 

    Olanzapine Monotherapy in Adolescents  - The safety and efficacy of ZYPREXA RELPREVV have not been established in patients under the age of 18 years.



 Mean increase in weight in adolescents was greater than in adults. In 4 placebo-controlled trials, discontinuation due to weight gain occurred in 1% of olanzapine-treated patients, compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients.

                                     Olanzapine-treated patients        Placebo-treated patients           
 Mean change in body weight from baseline (median exposure = 3 weeks)  4.6 kg (10.1 lb)                   0.3 kg (0.7 lb)                     
 Percentage of patients who gained at least 7% of baseline body weight  40.6%                              9.8%

 Percentage of patients who gained at least 15% of baseline body weight  7.1%                               2.7%                                
 (median exposure to 15% = 19 weeks)  (median exposure to 15% = 8 weeks)   
         In long-term studies (at least 24 weeks), the mean weight gain was 11.2 kg (24.6 lb); (median exposure of 201 days, N=179). The percentages of adolescents who gained at least 7%, 15%, or 25% of their baseline body weight with long-term exposure were 89%, 55%, and 29%, respectively. Among adolescent patients, mean weight gain by baseline BMI category was 11.5 kg (25.3 lb), 12.1 kg (26.6 lb), and 12.7 kg (27.9 lb), respectively, for normal (N=106), overweight (N=26) and obese (N=17). Discontinuation due to weight gain occurred in 2.2% of olanzapine-treated patients following at least 24 weeks of exposure.
 

   Table 8  shows data on adolescent weight gain with olanzapine pooled from 6 clinical trials. The data in each column represent data for those patients who completed treatment periods of the durations specified. Little clinical trial data is available on weight gain in adolescents with olanzapine beyond 6 months of treatment.

            5.8 Tardive Dyskinesia
 

  A syndrome of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown.



 The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses or may even arise after discontinuation of treatment.



 There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.



 Given these considerations, olanzapine should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients (1) who suffer from a chronic illness that is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.



 If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on olanzapine, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with olanzapine despite the presence of the syndrome.



    5.9 Orthostatic Hypotension



  ZYPREXA RELPREVV may induce orthostatic hypotension associated with dizziness, tachycardia, bradycardia and, in some patients, syncope, probably reflecting its alpha1-adrenergic antagonistic properties [see Patient Counseling Information (  17.9  )]  . Syncope-related adverse reactions were reported in 0.1% of patients treated with ZYPREXA RELPREVV in clinical studies.



 From an analysis of the vital sign data in an integrated database of 41 completed clinical studies in adult patients treated with oral olanzapine, orthostatic hypotension was recorded in &gt;=20% (1277/6030) of patients.



 Olanzapine should be used with particular caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications) where the occurrence of syncope, or hypotension and/or bradycardia might put the patient at increased medical risk. For patients in this population who have never taken oral olanzapine, tolerability should be established with oral olanzapine prior to initiating treatment with ZYPREXA RELPREVV [see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  )]  .



 Caution is necessary in patients who receive treatment with other drugs having effects that can induce hypotension, bradycardia, respiratory or central nervous system depression [see Drug Interactions (  7  )]  .



    5.10 Falls



  ZYPREXA RELPREVV may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy.



    5.11 Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis



   Class Effect  - In clinical trial and/or postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia/neutropenia have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents, including ZYPREXA. Agranulocytosis has also been reported.



 Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC) and history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Patients with a history of a clinically significant low WBC or drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and discontinuation of ZYPREXA RELPREVV should be considered at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors.



 Patients with clinically significant neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count &lt;1000/mm  3  ) should discontinue ZYPREXA RELPREVV and have their WBC followed until recovery.



    5.12 Dysphagia



  Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. Aspiration pneumonia is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with advanced Alzheimer's disease. Olanzapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease.



    5.13 Seizures



  During premarketing testing of ZYPREXA RELPREVV, seizures occurred in 0.15% of patients. During premarketing testing of oral olanzapine, seizures occurred in 0.9% of olanzapine-treated patients. There were confounding factors that may have contributed to the occurrence of seizures in many of these cases.



 Olanzapine should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that potentially lower the seizure threshold, e.g., Alzheimer's dementia. Olanzapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in a population of 65 years or older.



    5.14 Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment



  Sedation was a commonly reported adverse reaction associated with ZYPREXA RELPREVV treatment, occurring at an incidence of 8% in ZYPREXA RELPREVV patients compared to 2% in placebo patients. Somnolence and sedation adverse reactions led to discontinuation in 0.6% of patients in the premarketing ZYPREXA RELPREVV database.



 Since olanzapine has the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that olanzapine therapy does not affect them adversely. However, due to the risk of post-injection delirium/sedation syndrome after each injection, patients should not drive or operate heavy machinery for the remainder of the day of each injection [see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  ), Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  ), and Patient Counseling Information (  17.10  )]  .



    5.15 Body Temperature Regulation



  Disruption of the body's ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Appropriate care is advised when prescribing ZYPREXA RELPREVV for patients who will be experiencing conditions which may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature, e.g., exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medication with anticholinergic activity, or being subject to dehydration [see Patient Counseling Information (  17.11  )]  .



    5.16 Use in Patients with Concomitant Illness



  Experience with ZYPREXA RELPREVV in patients with concomitant systemic illnesses is limited [see Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )]  .



 Olanzapine exhibits in vitro muscarinic receptor affinity. In premarketing clinical trials with oral olanzapine, olanzapine was associated with constipation, dry mouth, and tachycardia, all adverse reactions possibly related to cholinergic antagonism. Such adverse reactions were not often the basis for discontinuations from olanzapine, but olanzapine should be used with caution in patients with clinically significant prostatic hypertrophy, narrow angle glaucoma, or a history of paralytic ileus or related conditions.



 In 5 placebo-controlled studies of oral olanzapine in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis (n=1184), the following treatment-emergent adverse reactions were reported in olanzapine-treated patients at an incidence of at least 2% and significantly greater than placebo-treated patients: falls, somnolence, peripheral edema, abnormal gait, urinary incontinence, lethargy, increased weight, asthenia, pyrexia, pneumonia, dry mouth and visual hallucinations. The rate of discontinuation due to adverse reactions was significantly greater with oral olanzapine than placebo (13% vs 7%). Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with olanzapine are at an increased risk of death compared to placebo. Olanzapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see  Boxed Warning  , Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  ), and Patient Counseling Information (  17.3  )]  .



 Olanzapine has not been evaluated or used to any appreciable extent in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable heart disease. Patients with these diagnoses were excluded from premarketing clinical studies. Because of the risk of orthostatic hypotension with olanzapine, caution should be observed in cardiac patients [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.9  )]  .



    5.17 Hyperprolactinemia



  As with other drugs that antagonize dopamine D2receptors, olanzapine elevates prolactin levels, and the elevation persists during chronic administration. Hyperprolactinemia may suppress hypothalamic GnRH, resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotropin secretion. This, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported in patients receiving prolactin-elevating compounds. Long-standing hyperprolactinemia when associated with hypogonadism may lead to decreased bone density in both female and male subjects.



 Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. As is common with compounds which increase prolactin release, an increase in mammary gland neoplasia was observed in the oral olanzapine carcinogenicity studies conducted in mice and rats [see Nonclinical Toxicology (  13.1  )]  . Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration of this class of drugs and tumorigenesis in humans; the available evidence is considered too limited to be conclusive at this time.



 In placebo-controlled olanzapine clinical studies (up to 12 weeks), changes from normal to high in prolactin concentrations were observed in 30% of adults treated with olanzapine as compared to 10.5% of adults treated with placebo. In a pooled analysis from clinical studies including 8136 adults treated with olanzapine, potentially associated clinical manifestations included menstrual-related events  1  (2% [49/3240] of females), sexual function-related events  2  (2% [150/8136] of females and males), and breast-related events  3  (0.7% [23/3240] of females, 0.2% [9/4896] of males).



 In placebo-controlled olanzapine monotherapy studies in adolescent patients (up to 6 weeks) with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes), changes from normal to high in prolactin concentrations were observed in 47% of olanzapine-treated patients compared to 7% of placebo-treated patients. In a pooled analysis from clinical trials including 454 adolescents treated with olanzapine, potentially associated clinical manifestations included menstrual-related events  1  (1% [2/168] of females), sexual function-related events  2  (0.7% [3/454] of females and males), and breast-related events  3  (2% [3/168] of females, 2% [7/286] of males) [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.4  )]  .



   1  Based on a search of the following terms: amenorrhea, hypomenorrhea, menstruation delayed, and oligomenorrhea.



   2  Based on a search of the following terms: anorgasmia, delayed ejaculation, erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, loss of libido, abnormal orgasm, and sexual dysfunction.



   3  Based on a search of the following terms: breast discharge, enlargement or swelling, galactorrhea, gynecomastia, and lactation disorder.



 Dose group differences with respect to prolactin elevation have been observed in some studies. In a 24-week randomized, double-blind, fixed-dose study with ZYPREXA RELPREVV, statistically significant differences among dose groups were observed for prolactin levels, with a mean baseline-to-endpoint increase observed in the highest dose group (300 mg/2 weeks, n=115: 3.57 ng/mL) relative to mean decreases in the lower dose groups (150 mg/2 weeks, n=109: -5.61 ng/mL; 405 mg/4 weeks, n=259: -2.76 ng/mL). In a single 8-week randomized, double-blind, fixed-dose study comparing 10 (N=199), 20 (N=200) and 40 (N=200) mg/day of oral olanzapine in adult patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, incidence of prolactin elevation &gt;24.2 ng/mL (female) or &gt;18.77 ng/mL (male) at any time during the trial (10 mg/day: 31.2%; 20 mg/day: 42.7%; 40 mg/day: 61.1%) indicated significant differences between 10 vs 40 mg/day and 20 vs 40 mg/day.



    5.18 Laboratory Tests



  Fasting blood glucose testing and lipid profile at the beginning of, and periodically during, treatment is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.7  ) and Patient Counseling Information (  17.6  ,  17.7  )]  .
