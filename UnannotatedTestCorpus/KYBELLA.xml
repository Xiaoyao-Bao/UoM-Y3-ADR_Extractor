    6    .    1          Clinical Trials Experience  

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 In two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials 513 subjects were treated with KYBELLA  (r)   (deoxycholic acid) injection and 506 subjects were treated with placebo.  The population was 19-65 years old, 85% were women, 87% Caucasian, 8% African American.  At baseline the population had a mean BMI of 29 kg/m  2  , moderate to severe submental convexity (graded as 2 or 3 on a 0 to 4 scale) and without excessive skin laxity.  Subjects received up to 6 treatments at least 1 month apart and were followed for up to 6 months after the last received treatment.



 The most commonly reported adverse reactions are listed below (Table 1).

 Other adverse reactions associated with the use of KYBELLA  (r)   include: injection site hemorrhage, injection site discoloration, pre-syncope/syncope, lymphadenopathy, injection site urticaria, and neck pain.



 Adverse reactions that lasted more than 30 days and occurred in more than 10% of subjects were injection site numbness (42%), injection site edema/swelling (20%), injection site pain (16%), and injection site induration (13%). 



     6.2         Postmarketing Experience  

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of KYBELLA  (r)  .



 Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not



 always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to



 KYBELLA  (r)  exposure.



   Administration site conditions  : injection site ulceration, necrosis and alopecia.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">     5         WARNINGS AND       PR   E   CAUTIONS  



   EXCERPT:    *  Marginal mandibular nerve (MMN) injury: Follow injection technique to avoid this injury. (  2.3  ,  5.1  ) 
 *  Dysphagia may occur with KYBELLA   (r)   use.  Use in patients with pre-existing dysphagia may exacerbate the condition. (  5.2  ) 
 *  Submental hematoma/bruising occurs frequently after KYBELLA   (r)   administration.  Use with caution in patients who are being treated with antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy or have coagulation abnormalities. (  5.3  ) 
 *  Avoid injecting in proximity to vulnerable anatomic structures due to the increased risk of tissue damage. (  2.3  ,  5.4  ) 
 *  Injection site alopecia: Withhold subsequent treatments until resolution. (  5.5  ) 
 *  Injection site ulceration and necrosis: Do not administer to the affected area until complete resolution. (  5.6  ) 
    
 

    5   .   1        Marginal mandibular nerve injury  



  Cases of marginal mandibular nerve injury, manifested as an asymmetric smile or facial muscle weakness (paresis), were reported during clinical trials.  To avoid the potential for nerve injury, KYBELLA  (r)   (deoxycholic acid) injection should not be injected into or in close proximity to the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve.  All marginal mandibular nerve injuries reported from the trials resolved spontaneously (range 1-298 days, median 44 days).



     5   .   2        Dysphagia  



  Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) occurred in clinical trials in the setting of administration site reactions, e.g., pain, swelling, and induration of the submental area.  Cases of dysphagia spontaneously resolved (range 1-81 days, median 3 days). 



 Subjects with current or prior history of dysphagia were excluded from clinical trials. Avoid use of KYBELLA  (r)  in these patients as current or prior history of dysphagia may exacerbate the condition. 



     5.3        Injection site hematoma   /bruising      



  In clinical trials, 72% of subjects treated with KYBELLA  (r)  experienced injection site hematoma/bruising  [see Adverse Reactions       (     6.1     )   ]  .



 KYBELLA  (r)  should be used with caution in patients with bleeding abnormalities or who are currently being treated with antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy as excessive bleeding or bruising in the treatment area may occur.



     5.4            Risk   of injecting in   proximity to vulnerable anatomic structure   s  



  To avoid potential tissue damage, KYBELLA  (r)  should not be injected into or in close proximity (1-1.5 cm) to salivary glands, lymph nodes and muscles.



     5.5         Injection site alopecia  



   Cases of injection site alopecia have been reported with the administration of KYBELLA  (r)  . The onset and duration of this adverse reaction may vary among individuals and may persist. Consider withholding subsequent treatments until resolution of the adverse reaction.  



     5.6         Injection site ulceration and necrosis  



   Injections that are too superficial (into the dermis) may result in skin ulceration and necrosis [see Injection Technique (     2.3     )]  . Cases of injection site ulceration and necrosis have been reported with the administration of KYBELLA  (r)  . Do not administer KYBELLA  (r)  into the affected area until complete resolution of the adverse reaction.
