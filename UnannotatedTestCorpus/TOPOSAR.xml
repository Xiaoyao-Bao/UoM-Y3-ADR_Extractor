  The following data on adverse reactions are based on both oral and intravenous administration of Toposar as a single agent, using several different dose schedules for treatment of a wide variety of malignancies.



   Hematologic Toxicity

  Myelosuppression is dose related and dose limiting, with granulocyte nadirs occurring 7 to 14 days after drug administration and platelet nadirs occurring 9 to 16 days after drug administration. Bone marrow recovery is usually complete by day 20, and no cumulative toxicity has been reported. Fever and infection have also been reported in patients with neutropenia. Death associated with myelosuppression has been reported.



 The occurrence of acute leukemia with or without a preleukemic phase has been reported rarely in patients treated with Toposar in association with other antineoplastic agents (see    WARNINGS    section).



   Gastrointestinal Toxicity

  Nausea and vomiting are the major gastrointestinal toxicities. The severity of such nausea and vomiting is generally mild to moderate with treatment discontinuation required in 1% of patients. Nausea and vomiting can usually be controlled with standard antiemetic therapy. Mild to severe mucositis/esophagitis may occur. Gastrointestinal toxicities are slightly more frequent after oral administration than after intravenous infusion.



   Hypotension

  Transient hypotension following rapid intravenous administration has been reported in 1% to 2% of patients. It has not been associated with cardiac toxicity or electrocardiographic changes. No delayed hypotension has been noted. To prevent this rare occurrence, it is recommended that Toposar be administered by slow intravenous infusion over a 30- to 60-minute period. If hypotension occurs, it usually responds to cessation of the infusion and administration of fluids or other supportive therapy as appropriate. When restarting the infusion, a slower administration rate should be used.



   Allergic Reactions

  Anaphylactic-like reactions characterized by chills, fever, tachycardia, bronchospasm, dyspnea, and/or hypotension have been reported to occur in 0.7% to 2% of patients receiving intravenous Toposar and in less than 1% of the patients treated with the oral capsules. These reactions have usually responded promptly to the cessation of the infusion and administration of pressor agents, corticosteroids, antihistamines, or volume expanders as appropriate; however, the reactions can be fatal. Hypertension and/or flushing have also been reported. Blood pressure usually normalizes within a few hours after cessation of the infusion. Anaphylactic-like reactions have occurred during the initial infusion of Toposar.



 Facial/tongue swelling, coughing, diaphoresis, cyanosis, tightness in throat, laryngospasm, back pain, and/or loss of consciousness have sometimes occurred in association with the above reactions. In addition, an apparent hypersensitivity-associated apnea has been reported rarely.



 Rash, urticaria, and/or pruritus have infrequently been reported at recommended doses. At investigational doses, a generalized pruritic erythematous maculopapular rash, consistent with perivasculitis, has been reported.



   Alopecia

  Reversible alopecia, sometimes progressing to total baldness, was observed in up to 66% of patients.



   Other Toxicities

  The following adverse reactions have been infrequently reported: abdominal pain, aftertaste, constipation, dysphagia, asthenia, fatigue, malaise, somnolence, transient cortical blindness, optic neuritis, interstitial pneumonitis/pulmonary fibrosis, fever, seizure (occasionally associated with allergic reactions), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, pigmentation, and a single report of radiation recall dermatitis.



 Hepatic toxicity, generally in patients receiving higher doses of the drug than those recommended, has been reported with Toposar. Metabolic acidosis has also been reported in patients receiving higher doses.



 Reports of extravasation with swelling have been received postmarketing. Rarely extravasation has been associated with necrosis and venous induration.



 The incidences of adverse reactions in the table that follows are derived from multiple data bases from studies in 2,081 patients when Toposar was used either orally or by injection as a single agent.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNINGS

  WARNINGS

  Toposar (etoposide injection) should be administered under the supervision of a qualified physician experienced in the use of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Severe myelosuppression with resulting infection or bleeding may occur.
</Section>
    <Section id="S3" name="precautions">    PRECAUTIONS



   General



  In all instances where the use of Toposar is considered for chemotherapy, the physician must evaluate the need and usefulness of the drug against the risk of adverse reactions. Most such adverse reactions are reversible if detected early. If severe reactions occur, the drug should be reduced in dosage or discontinued and appropriate corrective measures should be taken according to the clinical judgment of the physician. Reinstitution of Toposar therapy should be carried out with caution, and with adequate consideration of the further need for the drug and alertness as to possible recurrence of toxicity.



 Patients with low serum albumin may be at an increased risk for etoposide associated toxicities.



    Drug Interactions



  High-dose cyclosporin A resulting in concentrations above 2000 ng/mL administered with oral etoposide has led to an 80% increase in etoposide exposure with a 38% decrease in total body clearance of etoposide compared to etoposide alone.



    Laboratory Tests



  Periodic complete blood counts should be done during the course of Toposar treatment. They should be performed prior to each cycle of therapy and at appropriate intervals during and after therapy. At least one determination should be done prior to each dose of Toposar.



    Renal Impairment



  In patients with impaired renal function, the following initial dose modification should be considered based on measured creatinine clearance:




  Measured Creatinine Clearance    &gt;50 mL/min       15 to 50 mL/min     
  etoposide                        100% of dose     75% of dose         
         Subsequent Toposar dosing should be based on patient tolerance and clinical effect.
 

 Data are not available in patients with creatinine clearances &lt;15 mL/min and further dose reduction should be considered in these patients.



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility



   (see  WARNINGS  section)  



 Etoposide has been shown to be mutagenic in Ames assay.



 Treatment of Swiss-Albino mice with 1.5 mg/kg I.P. of Toposar on day 7 of gestation increased the incidence of intrauterine death and fetal malformations as well as significantly decreased the average fetal body weight. Maternal weight gain was not affected.



 Irreversible testicular atrophy was present in rats treated with etoposide intravenously for 30 days at 0.5 mg/kg/day (about 1/16  th  of the human dose on a mg/m  2  basis).



    Pregnancy



    Teratogenic Effects  



    Pregnancy "Category D."  



  (See   WARNINGS    section.)



    Nursing Mothers



  It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Toposar, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.



    Pediatric Use



  Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.



 Toposar contains polysorbate 80. In premature infants, a life-threatening syndrome consisting of liver and renal failure, pulmonary deterioration, thrombocytopenia, and ascites has been associated with an injectable vitamin E product containing polysorbate 80. Anaphylactic reactions have been reported in pediatric patients (see   WARNINGS    section).



    Geriatric Use



  Clinical studies of Toposar for the treatment of refractory testicular tumors did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Of more than 600 patients in four clinical studies in the NDA databases who received Toposar or etoposide phosphate in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of small cell lung cancer (SCLC), about one third were older than 65 years. When advanced age was determined to be a prognostic factor for response or survival in these studies, comparisons between treatment groups were performed for the elderly subset. In the one study (etoposide in combination with cyclophosphamide and vincristine compared with cyclophosphamide and vincristine or cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and doxorubicin) where age was a significant prognostic factor for survival, a survival benefit for elderly patients was observed for the etoposide regimen compared with the control regimens. No differences in myelosuppression were seen between elderly and younger patients in these studies except for an increased frequency of WHO Grade III or IV leukopenia among elderly patients in a study of etoposide phosphate or etoposide in combination with cisplatin. Elderly patients in this study also had more anorexia, mucositis, dehydration, somnolence, and elevated BUN levels than younger patients.



 In five single-agent studies of etoposide phosphate in patients with a variety of tumor types, 34% of patients were age 65 years or more. WHO Grade III or IV leukopenia, granulocytopenia, and asthenia were more frequent among elderly patients.



 Postmarketing experience also suggests that elderly patients may be more sensitive to some of the known adverse effects of etoposide, including myelosuppression, gastrointestinal effects, infectious complications, and alopecia.



 Although some minor differences in pharmacokinetic parameters between elderly and nonelderly patients have been observed, these differences were not considered clinically significant.



 Etoposide and its metabolites are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function (see PRECAUTIONS,  Renal Impairment    for recommended dosing adjustments in patients with renal impairment).
</Section>
    <Section id="S4" name="warnings">    WARNINGS



  Patients being treated with Toposar must be frequently observed for myelosuppression both during and after therapy. Myelosuppression resulting in death has been reported. Dose-limiting bone marrow suppression is the most significant toxicity associated with Toposar therapy. Therefore, the following studies should be obtained at the start of therapy and prior to each subsequent cycle of Toposar: platelet count, hemoglobin, white blood cell count, and differential. The occurrence of a platelet count below 50,000/mm  3  or an absolute neutrophil count below 500/mm  3  is an indication to withhold further therapy until the blood counts have sufficiently recovered.



 Physicians should be aware of the possible occurrence of an anaphylactic reaction manifested by chills, fever, tachycardia, bronchospasm, dyspnea, and hypotension. Higher rates of anaphylactic-like reactions have been reported in children who received infusions at concentrations higher than those recommended. The role that concentration of infusion (or rate of infusion) plays in the development of anaphylactic-like reactions is uncertain (see   ADVERSE REACTIONS    section). Treatment is symptomatic. The infusion should be terminated immediately, followed by the administration of pressor agents, corticosteroids, antihistamines, or volume expanders at the discretion of the physician.



 For parenteral administration, Toposar should be given only by slow intravenous infusion (usually over a 30- to 60-minute period) since hypotension has been reported as a possible side effect of rapid intravenous injection.



    Pregnancy



  Toposar can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Etoposide has been shown to be teratogenic in mice and rats.



 In rats, an intravenous etoposide dose of 0.4 mg/kg/day (about 1/20  th  of the human dose on a mg/m  2  basis) during organogenesis caused maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity, and teratogenicity (skeletal abnormalities, exencephaly, encephalocele, and anophthalmia); higher doses of 1.2 and 3.6 mg/kg/day (about 1/7  th  and 1/2 of human dose on a mg/m  2  basis) resulted in 90 and 100% embryonic resorptions. In mice, a single 1 mg/kg (1/16  th  of human dose on a mg/m  2  basis) dose of etoposide administered intraperitoneally on days 6, 7, or 8 of gestation caused embryotoxicity, cranial abnormalities, and major skeletal malformations. An I.P. dose of 1.5 mg/kg (about 1/10  th  of human dose on a mg/m  2  basis) on day 7 of gestation caused an increase in the incidence of intrauterine death and fetal malformations and a significant decrease in the average fetal body weight.



 Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug, the patient should be warned of the potential hazard to the fetus.



 Toposar should be considered a potential carcinogen in humans. The occurrence of acute leukemia with or without a preleukemic phase has been reported in rare instances in patients treated with etoposide alone or in association with other neoplastic agents. The risk of development of a preleukemic or leukemic syndrome is unclear. Carcinogenicity tests with Toposar have not been conducted in laboratory animals.
