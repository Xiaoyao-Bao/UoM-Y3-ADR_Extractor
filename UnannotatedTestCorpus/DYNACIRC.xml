  In multiple dose U.S. studies in hypertension, 1228 patients received DynaCirc  (r)  (isradipine) alone or in combination with other agents, principally a thiazide diuretic, 934 of them in controlled comparisons with placebo or active agents. An additional 652 patients (which includes 374 normal volunteers) received DynaCirc  (r)  (isradipine) in U.S. studies of conditions other than hypertension, and 1321 patients received DynaCirc  (r)  (isradipine) in non-U.S. studies. About 500 patients received DynaCirc  (r)  (isradipine) in long-term hypertension studies, 410 of them for at least 6 months. The adverse reaction rates given below are principally based on controlled hypertension studies, but rarer serious events are derived from all exposures to DynaCirc  (r)  (isradipine), including foreign marketing experience.



 Most adverse reactions were mild and related to the vasodilatory effects of DynaCirc  (r)  (dizziness, edema, palpitations, flushing, tachycardia), and many were transient. About 5% of isradipine patients left studies prematurely because of adverse reactions (vs. 3% of placebo patients and 6% of active control patients), principally due to headache, edema, dizziness, palpitations, and gastrointestinal disturbances.



 The following table shows the most common adverse reactions, volunteered or elicited, considered by the investigator to be at least possibly drug related. The results for



 the DynaCirc  (r)  (isradipine) treated patients are presented for all doses pooled together (reported by 1% or greater of patients receiving any dose of isradipine), and also for the two treatment regimens most applicable to the treatment of hypertension with DynaCirc  (r)  (isradipine): (1) initial and maintenance dose of 2.5 mg b.i.d., and (2) initial dose of 2.5 mg b.i.d. followed by maintenance dose of 5.0 mg b.i.d.

              Edema, palpitations, fatigue, and flushing appear to be dose-related, especially at the higher doses of 15-20 mg/day.
 

 In open-label, long-term studies of up to two years in duration, the adverse events reported were generally the same as those reported in the short-term controlled trials. The overall frequencies of these adverse events were slightly higher in the long-term than in the controlled studies, but as in the controlled trials most adverse reactions were mild and transient.



 The following adverse experiences were reported in 0.5%-1.0% of the isradipine-treated patients in hypertension studies, or are rare. More serious events from this and other data sources, including postmarketing exposure, are shown in italics. The relationship of these adverse events to isradipine administration is uncertain.



   Skin:  pruritus,  urticaria  



   Musculoskeletal:  cramps of legs/feet



   Respiratory:  cough



   Cardiovascular:  shortness of breath, hypotension,  atrial fibrillation, ventricular fibrillation, myocardial infarction, heart failure  



   Gastrointestinal:  abdominal discomfort, constipation, diarrhea



   Urogenital:  nocturia



   Nervous System:  drowsiness, insomnia, lethargy, nervousness, impotence, decreased libido, depression,  syncope, paresthesia  (which includes numbness and tingling),  transient    ischemic    attack, stroke  



   Autonomic:  hyperhidrosis, visual disturbance, dry mouth, numbness



   Miscellaneous:  throat discomfort,  leukopenia  , elevated  liver function   tests

   General



   Blood pressure



  Because DynaCirc  (r)  (isradipine) decreases peripheral resistance, like other calcium blockers DynaCirc  (r)  (isradipine) may occasionally produce symptomatic hypotension. However, symptoms like syncope and severe dizziness have rarely been reported in hypertensive patients administered DynaCirc  (r)  (isradipine), particularly at the initial recommended doses (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).



    Use in Patients with Congestive Heart Failure



  Although acute hemodynamic studies in patients with congestive heart failure have shown that DynaCirc  (r)  (isradipine) reduced afterload without impairing myocardial contractility, it has a negative inotropic effect at high doses in vitro,  and possibly in some patients. Caution should be exercised when using the drug in congestive heart failure patients, particularly in combination with a beta-blocker.



    Interactions



   Drug interactions



   Nitroglycerin:  DynaCirc  (r)  (isradipine) has been safely coadministered with nitroglycerin.



  Hydrochlorothiazide:  A study in normal healthy volunteers has shown that concomitant administration of DynaCirc  (r)  (isradipine) and hydrochlorothiazide does not result in altered pharmacokinetics of either drug. In a study in hypertensive patients, addition of isradipine to existing hydrochlorothiazide therapy did not result in any unexpected adverse effects, and isradipine had an additional antihypertensive effect.



  Propranolol:  In a single dose study in normal volunteers, co-administration of propranolol had a small effect on the rate but no effect on the extent of isradipine bioavailability. Significant increases in AUC (27%) and Cmax(58%) and decreases in tmax(23%) of propranolol were noted in this study. However, concomitant administrationof 5 mg b.i.d. isradipine and 40 mg b.i.d. propranolol to healthy volunteers under steady-state conditions had no relevant effect on either drug's bioavailability. AUC and Cmaxdifferences were &lt;20% between isradipine given singly and in combination with propranolol, and between propranolol given singly and in combination with isradipine.



  Cimetidine:  In a study in healthy volunteers, a one-week course of cimetidine at 400 mg b.i.d. with a single 5 mg dose of isradipine on the sixth day showed an increase in isradipine mean peak plasma concentrations (36%) and significant increase in area under the curve (50%). If isradipine therapy is initiated in a patient currently receiving cimetidine, careful monitoring for adverse reactions is advised and downward dose adjustment may be required.



  Rifampicin:  In a study in healthy volunteers, a six-day course of rifampicin at 600 mg/day followed by a single 5 mg dose of isradipine resulted in a reduction in isradipine levels to below detectable limits. If rifampicin therapy is required, isradipine concentrations and therapeutic effects are likely to be markedly reduced or abolished as a consequence of increased metabolism and higher clearance of isradipine.



  Warfarin:  In a study in healthy volunteers, no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction between isradipine and racemic warfarin was seen when two single oral doses of warfarin (0.7 mg/kg body weight) were administered during 11 days of multiple-dose treatment with 5 mg b.i.d. isradipine. Neither racemic warfarin nor isradipine binding to plasma proteins in vitro was altered by the addition of the other drug.



  Digoxin:  The concomitant administration of DynaCirc  (r)  (isradipine) and digoxin in a single-dose pharmacokinetic study did not affect renal, nonrenal and total body clearance of digoxin.



  Fentanyl Anesthesia:  Severe hypotension has been reported during fentanyl anesthesia with concomitant use of a beta blocker and a calcium channel blocker. Even though such interactions have not been seen in clinical studies with DynaCirc  (r)  (isradipine), an increased volume of circulating fluids might be required if such an interaction were to occur.



    Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility



  Treatment of male rats for 2 years with 2.5, 12.5, or 62.5 mg/kg/day isradipine admixed with the diet (approximately 6, 31, and 156 times the maximum recommended daily dose based on a 50 kg man) resulted in dose dependent increases in the incidence of benign Leydig cell tumors and testicular hyperplasia relative to untreated control animals. These findings, which were replicated in a subsequent experiment, may have been indirectly related to an effect of isradipine on circulating gonadotropin levels in the rats; a comparable endocrine effect was not evident in male patients receiving therapeutic doses of the drug on a chronic basis. Treatment of mice for two years with 2.5, 15, or 80 mg/kg/day isradipine in the diet (approximately 6, 38, and 200 times the maximum recommended daily dose based on a 50 kg man) showed no evidence of oncogenicity. There was no evidence of mutagenic potential based on the results of a battery of mutagenic tests. No effect on fertility was observed in male and female rats treated with up to 60 mg/kg/day isradipine.



    Pregnancy



   Pregnancy Category C:



  Isradipine was administered orally to rats and rabbits during organogenesis. Treatment of pregnant rats with doses of 6, 20, or 60 mg/kg/day produced a significant reduction in maternal weight gain during treatment with the highest dose (150 times the maximum recommended human daily dose) but with no lasting effects on the mother or the offspring. Treatment of pregnant rabbits with doses of 1,3, or 10 mg/kg/day (2.5, 7.5, and 25 times the maximum recommended human daily dose) produced decrements in maternal body weight gain and increased fetal resorption at the two higher doses. There was no evidence of embryotoxicity at doses which were not maternotoxic and no evidence of teratogenicity at any dose tested. In a peri/postnatal administration study in rats, reduced maternal body weight gain during late pregnancy at oral doses of 20 and 60 mg/kg/day isradipine was associated with reduced birth weights and decreased peri and postnatal pup survival.



 There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. The use of DynaCirc  (r)  (isradipine) during pregnancy should only be considered if the potential benefit outweighs potential risks.



    Nursing mothers



  It is not known whether DynaCirc  (r)  (isradipine) is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for adverse effects of DynaCirc  (r)  (isradipine) on nursing infants, a decision should be made as to whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.



    Pediatric use



  Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.
