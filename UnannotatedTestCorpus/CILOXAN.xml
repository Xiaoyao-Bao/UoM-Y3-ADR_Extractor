    <Section id="S1" name="adverse reactions">    ADVERSE REACTIONS:

  The most frequently reported drug related adverse reaction was local burning or discomfort. In corneal ulcer studies with frequent administration of the drug, white crystalline precipitates were seen in approximately 17% of patients (see PRECAUTIONS). Other reactions occurring in less than 10% of patients included lid margin crusting, crystals/scales, foreign body sensation, itching, conjunctival hyperemia and a bad taste following instillation. Additional events occurring in less than 1% of patients included corneal staining, keratopathy/keratitis, allergic reactions, lid edema, tearing, photophobia, corneal infiltrates, nausea and decreased vision.

    <Section id="S2" name="precautions">    PRECAUTIONS:



   



   General:  As with other antibacterial preparations, prolonged use of ciprofloxacin may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. Whenever clinical judgment dictates, the patient should be examined with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining.



 Ciprofloxacin should be discontinued at the first appearance of a skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity reaction.



 In clinical studies of patients with bacterial corneal ulcer, a white crystalline precipitate located in the superficial portion of the corneal defect was observed in 35 (16.6%) of 210 patients. The onset of the precipitate was within 24 hours to 7 days after starting therapy. In one patient, the precipitate was immediately irrigated out upon its appearance. In 17 patients, resolution of the precipitate was seen in 1 to 8 days (seven within the first 24 to 72 hours), in five patients, resolution was noted in 10 to 13 days. In nine patients, exact resolution days were unavailable; however, at follow-up examinations, 18 to 44 days after onset of the event, complete resolution of the precipitate was noted. In three patients, outcome information was unavailable. The precipitate did not preclude continued use of ciprofloxacin, nor did it adversely affect the clinical course of the ulcer or visual outcome (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).



    



   Information for patients:  Do not touch dropper tip to any surface, as this may contaminate the solution.



    



   Drug Interactions:  Specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with ophthalmic ciprofloxacin. However, the systemic administration of some quinolones has been shown to elevate plasma concentrations of theophylline, interfere with the metabolism of caffeine, enhance the effects of the oral anticoagulant, warfarin, and its derivatives, and has been associated with transient elevations in serum creatinine in patients receiving cyclosporine concomitantly.



    



   Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:  Eight in vitro  mutagenicity tests have been conducted with ciprofloxacin and the test results are listed below:



 *   Salmonella /Microsome Test (Negative) 
 *   E. coli DNA Repair Assay (Negative) 
 *  Mouse Lymphoma Cell Forward Mutation Assay (Positive) 
 *  Chinese Hamster V79Cell HGPRT Test (Negative) 
 *  Syrian Hamster Embryo Cell Transformation Assay (Negative) 
 *   Saccharomyces cerevisiae Point Mutation Assay (Negative) 
 *   Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mitotic Crossover and Gene Conversion Assay (Negative) 
 *  Rat Hepatocyte DNA Repair Assay (Positive) 
    Thus, two of the eight tests were positive, but the results of the following three in vivo  test systems gave negative results:
 

 *  Rat Hepatocyte DNA Repair Assay 
 *  Micronucleus Test (Mice) 
 *  Dominant Lethal Test (Mice) 
    Long term carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats have been completed. After daily oral dosing for up to two years, there is no evidence that ciprofloxacin had any carcinogenic or tumorigenic effects in these species.
 

    



   Pregnancy:  Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and mice at doses up to six times the usual daily human oral dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to ciprofloxacin. In rabbits, as with most antimicrobial agents, ciprofloxacin (30 and 100 mg/kg orally) produced gastrointestinal disturbances resulting in maternal weight loss and an increased incidence of abortion. No teratogenicity was observed at either dose. After intravenous administration, at doses up to 20 mg/kg, no maternal toxicity was produced and no embryotoxicity or teratogenicity was observed. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. CILOXAN  (r)  (ciprofloxacin ophthalmic solution) 0.3% should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings">    WARNINGS:



  NOT FOR INJECTION INTO THE EYE.



 Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions, some following the first dose, have been reported in patients receiving systemic quinolone therapy. Some reactions were accompanied by cardiovascular collapse, loss of consciousness, tingling, pharyngeal or facial edema, dyspnea, urticaria, and itching. Only a few patients had a history of hypersensitivity reactions. Serious anaphylactic reactions require immediate emergency treatment with epinephrine and other resuscitation measures, including oxygen, intravenous fluids, intravenous antihistamines, corticosteroids, pressor amines and airway management, as clinically indicated.
