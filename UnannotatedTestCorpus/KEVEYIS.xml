  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 In a 9-week randomized controlled trial in adults with hyperkalemic or hypokalemic periodic paralysis (Study 1), the most common adverse reactions in patients treated with KEVEYIS, with rates greater than placebo, were paresthesia, cognitive disorder, dysgeusia, and confusional state. The mean dose of KEVEYIS was 94 mg/day in patients with hypokalemic periodic paralysis and 82 mg/day in patients with hyperkalemic periodic paralysis.



 Table 1 lists the incidence of adverse reactions that occurred in &gt;= 5% of patients treated with KEVEYIS and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo in Study 1.

   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of dichlorphenamide. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 The following are adverse reactions which have been reported for dichlorphenamide that were serious adverse events or are not reported in the previous section of labeling  [see  Clinical Trials Experience (6.1)  ]  : amnesia, cardiac failure, condition aggravated, convulsion, fetal death, hallucination, nephrolithiasis, pancytopenia, psychotic disorder, renal tubular necrosis, stupor, syncope, tremor.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Hypersensitivity / Anaphylaxis / Idiosyncratic reactions: discontinue KEVEYIS at the first appearance of skin rash or any sign of immune-mediated or idiosyncratic adverse reaction (  5.1  ) 
 *  Hypokalemia: baseline and periodic measurement of serum potassium are recommended; if hypokalemia develops or persists, consider reducing the dose or discontinuing KEVEYIS (  5.3  ) 
 *  Metabolic acidosis: baseline and periodic measurement of serum bicarbonate are recommended; if metabolic acidosis develops or persists, consider reducing the dose or discontinuing KEVEYIS (  5.4  ) 
 *  Falls: consider reducing the dose or discontinuing KEVEYIS in patients who experience falls (  5.5  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Hypersensitivity / Anaphylaxis / Idiosyncratic Reactions



   Fatalities associated with the administration of sulfonamides have occurred due to adverse reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, fulminant hepatic necrosis, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia and other blood dyscrasias. Pulmonary involvement can occur in isolation or as part of a systemic reaction.  



  KEVEYIS should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any sign of immune-mediated or idiosyncratic adverse reaction.  



    5.2 Concomitant Use of Aspirin



  Anorexia, tachypnea, lethargy, and coma have been reported with concomitant use of dichlorphenamide and high-dose aspirin. The concomitant use of KEVEYIS and high dose aspirin is contraindicated. KEVEYIS should be used with caution in patients receiving low dose aspirin.



    5.3 Hypokalemia



  KEVEYIS increases potassium excretion and can cause hypokalemia. The risk of hypokalemia is greater when KEVEYIS is used in patients with conditions associated with hypokalemia (e.g., adrenocortical insufficiency, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, or respiratory acidosis), and in patients receiving other drugs that may cause hypokalemia (e.g., loop diuretics, thiazide diuretics, laxatives, antifungals, penicillin, and theophylline).



 Baseline and periodic measurement of serum potassium during KEVEYIS treatment are recommended.



 If hypokalemia develops or persists, consideration should be given to reducing the dose or discontinuing KEVEYIS.



    5.4 Metabolic Acidosis



   KEVEYIS can cause hyperchloremic non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. Concomitant use of KEVEYIS with other drugs that cause metabolic acidosis may increase the severity of metabolic acidosis.  



 Baseline and periodic measurement of serum bicarbonate during KEVEYIS treatment are recommended.



 If metabolic acidosis develops or persists, consideration should be given to reducing the dose or discontinuing KEVEYIS.



    5.5 Falls



   KEVEYIS increases the risk of falls. The risk of falls is greater in the elderly and with higher doses of KEVEYIS. Consider dose reduction or discontinuation of KEVEYIS in patients who experience falls while treated with KEVEYIS.
