  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     Clinical Trials in Adults with No Antiretroviral Treatment History  



 The primary safety assessment of BIKTARVY was based on Week 48 data from two randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trials, Trial 1489 and Trial 1490, that enrolled 1274 HIV-1 infected adult subjects with no antiretroviral treatment history. A total of 634 subjects received one tablet of BIKTARVY once daily  [see  Clinical Studies (14.2)  ]  .



 The most common adverse reactions (all Grades) reported in at least 5% of subjects in the BIKTARVY group in either Trial 1489 or Trial 1490 were diarrhea, nausea, and headache. The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment with BIKTARVY, abacavir [ABC]/dolutegravir [DTG]/ lamivudine [3TC]), or DTG + FTC/TAF, due to adverse events, regardless of severity, was 1%, 1%, and &lt;1%, respectively. Table 1 displays the frequency of adverse reactions (all Grades) greater than or equal to 2% in the BIKTARVY group.

           Additional adverse reactions (all Grades) occurring in less than 2% of subjects administered BIKTARVY in Trials 1489 and 1490 included vomiting, flatulence, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, rash, and depression.
 

 Suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and depression suicidal occurred in &lt;1% of subjects administered BIKTARVY; all events were serious and primarily occurred in subjects with a preexisting history of depression, prior suicide attempt or psychiatric illness.



 The majority (87%) of adverse events associated with BIKTARVY were Grade 1.



     Clinical Trials in Virologically Suppressed Adults  



 The safety of BIKTARVY in virologically-suppressed adults was based on Week 48 data from 282 subjects in a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial (Trial 1844) in which virologically-suppressed subjects were switched from either DTG + ABC/3TC or ABC/DTG/3TC to BIKTARVY; and Week 48 data from 290 subjects in an open-label, active-controlled trial in which virologically-suppressed subjects were switched from a regimen containing atazanavir (ATV) (given with cobicistat or ritonavir) or darunavir (DRV) (given with cobicistat or ritonavir) plus either FTC/TDF or ABC/3TC, to BIKTARVY (Trial 1878). Overall, the safety profile in virologically suppressed adult subjects in Trials 1844 and 1878 was similar to that in subjects with no antiretroviral treatment history  [see  Clinical Studies (14.3)  ]  .



     Laboratory Abnormalities  



 The frequency of laboratory abnormalities (Grades 3-4) occurring in at least 2% of subjects receiving BIKTARVY in Trials 1489 and 1490 are presented in Table 2.

               Changes in Serum Creatinine:  BIC has been shown to increase serum creatinine due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine without affecting renal glomerular function  [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)  ]  . Increases in serum creatinine occurred by Week 4 of treatment and remained stable through Week 48. In Trials 1489 and 1490, median (Q1, Q3) serum creatinine increased by 0.10 (0.03, 0.17) mg per dL from baseline to Week 48 in the BIKTARVY group and was similar to the comparator groups who received ABC/DTG/3TC, or DTG + FTC/TAF. There were no discontinuations due to renal adverse events through Week 48 in BIKTARVY clinical trials.
 

     Changes in Bilirubin:  In Trials 1489 and 1490, total bilirubin increases were observed in 12% of subjects administered BIKTARVY through Week 48. Increases were primarily Grade 1 (1.0 to 1.5 * ULN) (9%) and Grade 2 (1.5 to 2.5 * ULN) (3%). Graded bilirubin increases in the ABC/DTG/3TC, and DTG + FTC/TAF groups, were 4% and 6%, respectively. Increases were primarily Grade 1 (3% ABC/DTG/3TC and 5% DTG + FTC/TAF) or Grade 2 (1% ABC/DTG/3TC and 1% DTG + FTC/TAF). There were no discontinuations due to hepatic adverse events through Week 48 in BIKTARVY clinical studies.

   EXCERPT:   WARNING: POST TREATMENT ACUTE EXACERBATION OF HEPATITIS B



   See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.  



 *  Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV and have discontinued products containing emtricitabine (FTC) and/or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), and may occur with discontinuation of BIKTARVY. Closely monitor hepatic function in these patients. If appropriate, anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted. ( 5.1)

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Immune reconstitution syndrome: May necessitate further evaluation and treatment. (  5.3  ) 
 *  New onset or worsening renal impairment: Assess serum creatinine, estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose and urine protein when initiating BIKTARVY and during therapy as clinically appropriate in all patients. Also assess serum phosphorus in patients with chronic kidney disease. (  5.4  ) 
 *  Lactic acidosis/severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: Discontinue treatment in patients who develop symptoms or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity. (  5.5  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Severe Acute Exacerbation of Hepatitis B in Patients Coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV



  Patients with HIV-1 should be tested for the presence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection before or when initiating antiretroviral therapy [see  Dosage and Administration (2.1)  ]  .



 Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B (e.g., liver decompensation and liver failure) have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV and have discontinued products containing FTC and/or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), and may occur with discontinuation of BIKTARVY. Patients coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV who discontinue BIKTARVY should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. If appropriate, anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted, especially in patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, since post-treatment exacerbation of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation and liver failure.



    5.2 Risk of Adverse Reactions or Loss of Virologic Response Due to Drug Interactions



  The concomitant use of BIKTARVY with certain other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to [see  Contraindications (4)  and  Drug Interactions (7.5)  ]:  



 *  Loss of therapeutic effect of BIKTARVY and possible development of resistance. 
 *  Possible clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of concomitant drugs. 
    See  Table 3  for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during BIKTARVY therapy; review concomitant medications during BIKTARVY therapy; and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drugs.
 

    5.3 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome



  Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections [such as Mycobacterium avium  infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii  pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis], which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.



 Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.



    5.4 New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment



  Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia), has been reported with the use of tenofovir prodrugs in both animal toxicology studies and human trials. In clinical trials of BIKTARVY, there have been no cases of Fanconi syndrome or Proximal Renal Tubulopathy (PRT). In clinical trials of BIKTARVY in subjects with no antiretroviral treatment history with eGFRs greater than 30 mL per minute, and in virologically suppressed subjects switched to BIKTARVY with eGFRs greater than 50 mL per minute, renal serious adverse events were encountered in less than 1% of subjects treated with BIKTARVY through Week 48 [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  BIKTARVY is not recommended in patients with estimated creatinine clearance below 30 mL per minute.



 Patients taking tenofovir prodrugs who have impaired renal function and those taking nephrotoxic agents including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are at increased risk of developing renal-related adverse reactions.



 Prior to or when initiating BIKTARVY, and during treatment with BIKTARVY, assess serum creatinine, estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose and urine protein in all patients as clinically appropriate. In patients with chronic kidney disease, also assess serum phosphorus. Discontinue BIKTARVY in patients who develop clinically significant decreases in renal function or evidence of Fanconi syndrome.



    5.5 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis



  Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs, including emtricitabine, a component of BIKTARVY, and tenofovir DF, another prodrug of tenofovir, alone or in combination with other antiretrovirals. Treatment with BIKTARVY should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations).
