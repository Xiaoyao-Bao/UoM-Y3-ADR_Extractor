   General



   Nystatin Topical Powder should not be used for the treatment of systemic, oral, intravaginal or ophthalmic infections.  



 If irritation or sensitization develops, treatment should be discontinued and appropriate measures taken as indicated. It is recommended that KOH smears, cultures, or other diagnostic methods be used to confirm the diagnosis of cutaneous or mucocutaneous candidiasis and to rule out infection caused by other pathogens.



    INFORMATION FOR THE PATIENT



  Patients using this medication should receive the following information and instructions:



 *  1.  The patient should be instructed to use this medication as directed (including the replacement of missed doses). This medication is not for any disorder other than that for which it is prescribed. 
 *  2.  Even if symptomatic relief occurs within the first few days of treatment, the patient should be advised not to interrupt or discontinue therapy until the prescribed course of treatment is completed. 
 *  3.  If symptoms of irritation develop, the patient should be advised to notify the physician promptly. 
       Laboratory Tests
 

  If there is a lack of therapeutic response, KOH smears, cultures, or other diagnostic methods should be repeated.



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility



  No long-term animal studies have been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of nystatin. No studies have been performed to determine the mutagenicity of nystatin or its effects on male or female fertility.



    Pregnancy:



   Teratogenic Effects



  Category C. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with any nystatin topical preparation. It also is not known whether these preparations can cause fetal harm when used by a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity. Nystatin topical preparations should be prescribed for a pregnant woman only if the potential benefit to the mother outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.



    Nursing Mothers



  It is not known whether nystatin is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when nystatin is prescribed for a nursing woman.



    Pediatric Use



  Safety and effectiveness have been established in the pediatric population from birth to 16 years. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  ).
