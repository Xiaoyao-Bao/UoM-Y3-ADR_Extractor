  The following local adverse reactions have been reported infrequently with topical corticosteroids. They may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings, especially with higher potency corticosteroids. These reactions are listed in an approximate decreasing order of occurrence: burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, skin atrophy, striae, and miliaria. One peanut sensitive child experienced a flare of his atopic dermatitis after 5 days of twice daily treatment with Derma-Smoothe/FS  (r)  .



 A post marketing (open-label) safety study was conducted in 58 children to evaluate the local safety of Derma-Smoothe/FS  (r)  when applied twice daily for 4 weeks to the face in children (2 to 12 years) with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (see  Table of Incidence of Adverse Events  ).

   General:



  Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment. Manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria can also be produced in some patients by systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids while on treatment.



 Patients applying a topical steroid to a large surface area or to areas under occlusion should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression. This may be done by using the ACTH stimulation, A.M. plasma cortisol, and urinary free cortisol tests.



 If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent corticosteroid. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of glucocorticoid insufficiency may occur requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. For information on systemic supplementation, see prescribing information for those products.



 Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios. (See  PRECAUTIONS-Pediatric use  )



 Allergic contact dermatitis to any component of topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by a failure to heal  rather than noting a clinical exacerbation, which may occur with most topical products not containing corticosteroids. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic testing. One peanut sensitive child experienced a flare of his atopic dermatitis after 5 days of twice daily treatment with Derma-Smoothe/FS  (r)  (see  CLINICAL STUDIES  section).



 If wheal and flare type reactions (which may be limited to pruritus) or other manifestations of hypersensitivity develop, Derma-Smoothe/FS  (r)  should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy instituted.



 If concomitant skin infections are present or develop, an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be used. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, use of Derma-Smoothe/ FS  (r)  should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled.



 Derma-Smoothe/FS  (r)  is formulated with 48% refined peanut oil NF. Peanut oil used in this product is routinely tested for peanut proteins through amino acid analysis; the quantity of amino acids is below 0.5 parts per million (ppm). Physicians should use caution in prescribing Derma-Smoothe/FS  (r)  for peanut sensitive individuals.



    Information for Patients:



  Patients using topical corticosteroids should receive the following information and instructions:



 *  This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is for external use only. Avoid contact with the eyes. In case of contact, wash eyes liberally with water. 
 *  This medication should not be used for any disorder other than that for which it was prescribed. 
 *  Patients should promptly report to their physician any worsening of their skin condition. 
 *  Parents of pediatric patients should be advised not to use Derma-Smoothe/FS  (r)  in the treatment of diaper dermatitis. Derma-Smoothe/FS  (r)  should not be applied to the diaper area as diapers or plastic pants may constitute occlusive dressing. 
 *  This medication should not be used on the face, underarm, or groin unless directed by the physician. 
 *  As with other corticosteroids, therapy should be discontinued when control is achieved. If no improvement is seen within 2 weeks, contact the physician. 
       Laboratory Tests:
 

  The following tests may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression:



  ACTH stimulation test  A.M. plasma cortisol testUrinary free cortisol test
 

    Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and impairment of fertility:



  Long-term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential or the effect on fertility of Derma-Smoothe/FS  (r)  . Studies have not been performed to evaluate the mutagenic potential of fluocinolone acetonide, the active ingredient in Derma-Smoothe/FS  (r)  . Some corticosteroids have been found to be genotoxic in various genotoxicity tests (i.e. the in vitro  human peripheral blood lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay with metabolic activation, the in vivo  mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay, the Chinese hamster micronucleus test and the in vitro  mouse lymphoma gene mutation assay).



    Pregnancy:



   Teratogenic effects: Pregnancy category C.



  Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. Some corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals.



 There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women on teratogenic effects from Derma-Smoothe/FS  (r)  . Therefore, Derma-Smoothe/FS  (r)  should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.
