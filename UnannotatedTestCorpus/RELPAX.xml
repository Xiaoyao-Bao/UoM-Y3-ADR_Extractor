  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 Among 4,597 patients who treated the first migraine headache with RELPAX in short-term placebo-controlled trials, the most common adverse reactions reported with treatment with RELPAX were asthenia, nausea, dizziness, and somnolence. These reactions appear to be dose-related.



 In long-term open-label studies where patients were allowed to treat multiple migraine attacks for up to 1 year, 128 (8.3%) out of 1,544 patients discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions.



 Table 1 lists adverse reactions that occurred in the subset of 5,125 migraineurs who received eletriptan doses of 20 mg, 40 mg and 80 mg or placebo in worldwide placebo-controlled clinical trials.



 Only adverse reactions that were more frequent in a RELPAX treatment group compared to the placebo group with an incidence greater than or equal to 2% are included in Table 1.

           The frequency of adverse reactions in clinical trials did not increase when up to 2 doses of RELPAX were taken within 24 hours. The incidence of adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender, age, or race of the patients. Adverse reaction frequencies were also unchanged by concomitant use of drugs commonly taken for migraine prophylaxis (e.g., SSRIs, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressants), estrogen replacement therapy or oral contraceptives.
 

   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reaction(s) have been identified during post approval use of RELPAX. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Neurological:  seizure



   Digestive:  vomiting
</Section>
    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



  RELPAX should only be used where a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established.



    EXCERPT:    *  Myocardial ischemia/infarction or Prinzmetal's angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors (  5.1  ) 
 *  Arrhythmias: Discontinue RELPAX if occurs (  5.2  ) 
 *  Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not myocardial ischemia; evaluate high risk patients for CAD (  5.3  ) 
 *  Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or stroke: Discontinue RELPAX if occurs (  5.4  ) 
 *  Gastrointestinal ischemia or infarction events, or peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue RELPAX if occurs (  5.5  ) 
 *  Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary (  5.6  ) 
 *  Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue RELPAX if occurs (  5.7  ,  7.3  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina



  RELPAX is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of RELPAX. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. RELPAX may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's angina), even in patients without a history of CAD.



 Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving RELPAX. Do not use RELPAX if there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm [see  Contraindications (4)  ].  For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first RELPAX dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of RELPAX. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of RELPAX.



    5.2 Arrhythmias



  Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1agonists. Discontinue RELPAX if these disturbances occur. RELPAX is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders [see  Contraindications (4)  ].  



    5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure



  Sensations of tightness, pain, and pressure in the chest, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with RELPAX and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. RELPAX is contraindicated in patients with CAD or Prinzmetal's variant angina [see  Contraindications (4)  ].  



    5.4 Cerebrovascular Events



  Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not.



 Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical of migraine, other potentially serious neurological conditions need to be excluded. RELPAX is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA [see  Contraindications (4)  ].  



    5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions



  RELPAX may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), and Raynaud's syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of a vasospastic reaction following the use of any 5-HT1agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional RELPAX doses [see  Contraindications (4)  ].  



    5.6 Medication Overuse Headache



   Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g. ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused acute migraine drugs and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary.  



    5.7 Serotonin Syndrome



  Serotonin syndrome may occur with RELPAX, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors [see  Drug Interactions (7.3)  ].  Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue RELPAX if serotonin syndrome is suspected.



    5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure



  Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT1agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with RELPAX. RELPAX is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see  Contraindications (4)  ].  



    5.9 Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions



  There have been reports of anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid, and hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients receiving RELPAX. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. RELPAX is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to RELPAX [see  Contraindications (4)  ].
