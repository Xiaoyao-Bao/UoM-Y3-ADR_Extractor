  The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of labeling:



 *  Increased Bleeding Time [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]  
 *  Delayed Healing [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]  
 *  Corneal Effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]  
      EXCERPT:   Most common adverse reactions (5 to 10%) are capsular opacity, decreased visual acuity, foreign body sensation, increased intraocular pressure and sticky sensation. (  6.1  )
 

   To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Alcon Laboratories, Inc. at 1-800-757-9195 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.  



 

  6.1       Clinical Studies Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The most frequently reported ocular adverse reactions following cataract surgery were capsular opacity, decreased visual acuity, foreign body sensation, increased intraocular pressure, and sticky sensation. These reactions occurred in approximately 5 to 10% of patients.



 Other ocular adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of approximately 1 to 5% included conjunctival edema, corneal edema, dry eye, lid margin crusting, ocular discomfort, ocular hyperemia, ocular pain, ocular pruritus, photophobia, tearing and vitreous detachment.



 Some of these reactions may be the consequence of the cataract surgical procedure.



 Non-ocular adverse reactions reported at an incidence of 1 to 4% included headache, hypertension, nausea/vomiting, and sinusitis.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">     5         WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  



  EXCERPT:   Increased bleeding time due to interference with thrombocyte aggregation (  5.1  )



 Delayed healing (  5.2  )



 Corneal effects including keratitis (  5.3  )



 



   5.1       Increased Bleeding Time



  With some NSAIDs, including NEVANAC (nepafenac ophthalmic suspension), 0.1%, there exists the potential for increased bleeding time due to interference with thrombocyte aggregation. There have been reports that ocularly applied NSAIDs may cause increased bleeding of ocular tissues (including hyphema) in conjunction with ocular surgery.



 It is recommended that NEVANAC (nepafenac ophthalmic suspension), 0.1% be used with caution in patients with known bleeding tendencies or who are receiving other medications which may prolong bleeding time.



    5.2       Delayed Healing



  Topical NSAIDs, including NEVANAC (nepafenac ophthalmic suspension), 0.1%, may slow or delay healing. Topical corticosteroids are also known to slow or delay healing. Concomitant use of topical NSAIDs and topical steroids may increase the potential for healing problems.



    5.3       Corneal Effects



  Use of topical NSAIDs may result in keratitis. In some susceptible patients, continued use of topical NSAIDs may result in epithelial breakdown, corneal thinning, corneal erosion, corneal ulceration or corneal perforation. These events may be sight threatening. Patients with evidence of corneal epithelial breakdown should immediately discontinue use of topical NSAIDs, including NEVANAC (nepafenac ophthalmic suspension), 0.1%, and should be closely monitored for corneal health.



 Postmarketing experience with topical NSAIDs suggests that patients with complicated ocular surgeries, corneal denervation, corneal epithelial defects, diabetes mellitus, ocular surface diseases (e.g., dry eye syndrome), rheumatoid arthritis, or repeat ocular surgeries within a short period of time may be at increased risk for corneal adverse events which may become sight threatening. Topical NSAIDs should be used with caution in these patients.



 Postmarketing experience with topical NSAIDs also suggests that use more than 1 day prior to surgery or use beyond 14 days post-surgery may increase patient risk and severity of corneal adverse events.



    5.4       Contact Lens Wear



  NEVANAC* (nepafenac ophthalmic suspension), 0.1% should not be administered while using contact lenses.
