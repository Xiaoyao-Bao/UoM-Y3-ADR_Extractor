         In addition, in other trials amnionitis and intrauterine fetal sepsis have been associated with extra-amniotic intrauterine administration of PGE2. Uterine rupture has been reported in association with the use of PREPIDIL Gel intracervically. Additional events reported in the literature, associated by the authors with the use of PREPIDIL Gel, included premature rupture of membranes, fetal depression (1 min Apgar &lt; 7), and fetal acidosis (umbilical artery pH &lt; 7.15).
 

   Post-marketing surveillance

  Blood and lymphatic system disorders

  An increased risk of post-partum disseminated intravascular coagulation has been described in patients whose labor was induced by pharmacological means, either with dinoprostone or oxytocin (see    WARNINGS  )  . The frequency of this adverse event, however, appears to be rare (&lt;1 per 1,000 labors).



   Immune system disorders

  Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., Anaphylactic reaction, Anaphylactic shock, Anaphylactoid reaction).

    <Section id="S2" name="precautions">    PRECAUTIONS



   1. General Precautions



  During use, uterine activity, fetal status, and character of the cervix (dilation and effacement) should be carefully monitored either by auscultation or electronic fetal monitoring to detect possible evidence of undesired responses, e.g., hypertonus, sustained uterine contractility, or fetal distress. In cases where there is a history of hypertonic uterine contractility or tetanic uterine contractions, it is recommended that uterine activity and the state of the fetus should be continuously monitored. The possibility of uterine rupture should be borne in mind when high-tone myometrial contractions are sustained. Feto-pelvic relationships should be carefully evaluated before use of PREPIDIL Gel (see   CONTRAINDICATIONS    ).



 Caution should be exercised in administration of PREPIDIL Gel in patients with:



 *  asthma or history of asthma 
 *  glaucoma or raised intraocular pressure 
    Caution should be taken so as not to administer PREPIDIL Gel above the level of the internal os. Careful vaginal examination will reveal the degree of effacement which will regulate the size of the shielded endocervical catheter to be used. That is, the 20 mm endocervical catheter should be used if no effacement is present, and the 10 mm catheter should be used if the cervix is 50% effaced. Placement of PREPIDIL Gel into the extra-amniotic space has been associated with uterine hyperstimulation.
 

 As PREPIDIL Gel is extensively metabolized in the lung, liver, and kidney, and the major route of elimination is the kidney, PREPIDIL Gel should be used with caution in patients with renal and hepatic dysfunction.



    2. Patients With Ruptured Membranes



  Caution should be exercised in the administration of PREPIDIL Gel in patients with ruptured membranes. The safety of use of PREPIDIL Gel in these patients has not been determined.



    3. Drug Interactions



  PREPIDIL Gel may augment the activity of other oxytocic agents and their concomitant use is not recommended. For the sequential use of oxytocin following PREPIDIL Gel administration, a dosing interval of 6-12 hours is recommended.



    4. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility



  Carcinogenic bioassay studies have not been conducted in animals with PREPIDIL Gel due to the limited indications for use and short duration of administration. No evidence of mutagenicity was observed in the Micronucleus Test or Ames Assay.



    5. Pregnancy,



   Teratogenic Effects



  Prostaglandin E2 produced an increase in skeletal anomalies in rats and rabbits. No effect would be expected clinically, when used as indicated, since PREPIDIL Gel is administered after the period of organogenesis. PREPIDIL Gel has been shown to be embryotoxic in rats and rabbits, and any dose that produces sustained increased uterine tone could put the embryo or fetus at risk. See statements under  General Precautions  .



    6. Pediatric Use



  Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.

   FOR HOSPITAL USE ONLY  



 Dinoprostone, as with other potent oxytocic agents, should be used only with strict adherence to recommended dosages. Dinoprostone should be administered by physicians in a hospital that can provide immediate intensive care and acute surgical facilities.



 Women aged 30 years or older, those with complications during pregnancy and those with a gestational age over 40 weeks have been shown to have an increased risk of post-partum disseminated intravascular coagulation. In addition, these factors may further increase the risk associated with labor induction (see   ADVERSE REACTIONS    ). Therefore, in these women, use of dinoprostone should be undertaken with caution. Measures should be applied to detect as soon as possible an evolving fibrinolysis in the immediate post-partum phase.



 The Clinician should be alert that the intracervical placement of dinoprostone gel may result in inadvertent disruption and subsequent embolization of antigenic tissue causing in rare circumstances the development of Anaphylactoid Syndrome of Pregnancy (Amniotic Fluid Embolism).



 There have been post-marketing reports of serious and life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and angioedema with PREPIDIL Gel (dinoprostone). Onset of these reported reactions occurred within minutes to hours after initiation with PREPIDIL Gel (dinoprostone). If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, if possible remove PREPIDIL Gel (dinoprostone). Assess for other potential causes of the event, and institute symptomatic and supportive therapy, as needed.
