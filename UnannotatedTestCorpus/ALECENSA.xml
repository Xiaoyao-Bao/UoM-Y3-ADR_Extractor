  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     Previously Untreated ALK-Positive Metastatic NSCLC  



 The safety of ALECENSA was evaluated in 152 patients with ALK-positive NSCLC in the ALEX study. The median duration of exposure to ALECENSA was 17.9 months. Patient characteristics of the ALEX study population (n=303) were: median age 56 years, age less than 65 (77%), female (56%), Caucasian (50%), Asian (46%), adenocarcinoma histology (92%), never smoker (63%), and ECOG PS 0 or 1 (93%).



 Serious adverse reactions occurred in 28% of patients treated with ALECENSA; serious adverse reactions reported in 2% or more of patients treated with ALECENSA were pneumonia (4.6%), and renal impairment (3.9%). Grade &gt;= 3 adverse events were reported for 41% of patients in the ALECENSA arm. Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 3.3% of patients treated with ALECENSA; these were renal impairment (2 patients), sudden death, cardiac arrest, and pneumonia (1 patient each). Permanent discontinuation of ALECENSA for adverse reactions occurred in 11% of patients. Adverse drug reactions that led to discontinuation of ALECENSA in 1% or more of patients were renal impairment (2.0%), hyperbilirubinemia (1.3%), increased ALT (1.3%), and increased AST (1.3%). Dose reductions and drug interruption due to adverse reactions occurred in 16% and 19% of patients, respectively, in the ALECENSA arm. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to dose modifications in the ALECENSA arm were hyperbilirubinemia (6%), increased AST (5%), increased ALT (4.6%), and pneumonia (3.3%).



   Tables 3  and  4  summarize the common adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities observed in ALEX.

 The safety of ALECENSA was evaluated in 253 patients with ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with ALECENSA in two clinical trials, Studies NP28761 and NP28673. The median duration of exposure to ALECENSA was 9.3 months. One hundred sixty-nine patients (67%) were exposed to ALECENSA for more than 6 months, and 100 patients (40%) for more than one year. The population characteristics were: median age 53 years, age less than 65 (86%), female (55%), White (74%), Asian (18%), NSCLC adenocarcinoma histology (96%), never or former smoker (98%), ECOG Performance Status (PS) 0 or 1 (91%), and prior chemotherapy treatment (78%).



 Serious adverse reactions occurred in 19% of patients; the most frequently reported serious adverse reactions were pulmonary embolism (1.2%), dyspnea (1.2%), and hyperbilirubinemia (1.2%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 2.8% of patients and included hemorrhage (0.8%), intestinal perforation (0.4%), dyspnea (0.4%), pulmonary embolism (0.4%), and endocarditis (0.4%). Permanent discontinuation of ALECENSA for adverse reactions occurred in 6% of patients. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to permanent discontinuation were hyperbilirubinemia (1.6%), increased ALT levels (1.6%), and increased AST levels (1.2%). Overall, 23% of patients initiating treatment at the recommended dose required at least one dose reduction. The median time to first dose reduction was 48 days. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to dose reductions or interruptions were elevations in bilirubin (6%), CPK (4.3%), ALT (4.0%), and AST (2.8%), and vomiting (2.8%).



   Tables 5  and  6  summarize the common adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities observed in Studies NP28761 and NP28673.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Hepatotoxicity: Monitor liver laboratory tests every 2 weeks during the first 3 months of treatment, then once a month and as clinically indicated, with more frequent testing in patients who develop transaminase and bilirubin elevations. In case of severe ALT, AST, or bilirubin elevations, withhold, then reduce dose, or permanently discontinue ALECENSA. (  2.3  ,  5.1  ) 
 *  Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis: Immediately withhold ALECENSA in patients diagnosed with ILD/pneumonitis and permanently discontinue if no other potential causes of ILD/pneumonitis have been identified. (  2.3  ,  5.2  ) 
 *  Renal Impairment: Withhold ALECENSA for severe renal impairment, then resume ALECENSA at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue (  2.3  ,  5.3  ). 
 *  Bradycardia: Monitor heart rate and blood pressure regularly. If symptomatic, withhold ALECENSA then reduce dose, or permanently discontinue. (  2.3  ,  5.4  ) 
 *  Severe Myalgia and Creatine Phosphokinase (CPK) Elevation: Assess CPK every 2 weeks during the first month of treatment and in patients reporting unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness. In case of severe CPK elevations, withhold, then resume or reduce dose. (  2.3  ,  5.5  ) 
 *  Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: ALECENSA can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. (  5.6  ,  8.1  ,  8.3  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Hepatotoxicity



   Elevations of AST greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) occurred in 4.6% of patients, and elevations of ALT greater than 5 times the ULN occurred in 5.3% of the 405 patients in Studies NP28761, NP28673 and ALEX who received ALECENSA at a dose of 600 mg BID. Elevations of bilirubin greater than 3 times the ULN occurred in 3.7% of patients. The majority (69% of the patients with hepatic transaminase elevations and 68% of the patients with bilirubin elevations) of these events occurred during the first 3 months of treatment. Six patients discontinued ALECENSA for Grades 3-4 AST and/or ALT elevations, and 4 patients discontinued ALECENSA for Grade 3 bilirubin elevations. Concurrent elevations in ALT or AST greater than or equal to 3 times the ULN and total bilirubin greater than or equal to 2 times the ULN, with normal alkaline phosphatase, occurred in less than 1% of patients treated with ALECENSA across clinical trials. Three patients with Grades 3-4 AST/ALT elevations had drug-induced liver injury (documented by liver biopsy in two cases).  



 Monitor liver function tests including ALT, AST, and total bilirubin every 2 weeks during the first 3 months of treatment, then once a month and as clinically indicated, with more frequent testing in patients who develop transaminase and bilirubin elevations. Based on the severity of the adverse drug reaction, withhold ALECENSA and resume at a reduced dose or permanently discontinue ALECENSA as described in  Table 2    [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ].  



    5.2 Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis



   ILD/pneumonitis occurred in three (0.7%) patients treated with ALECENSA in Studies NP28761, NP28673 and ALEX. One (0.2%) of these events was severe (Grade 3).  



 Promptly investigate for ILD/pneumonitis in any patient who presents with worsening of respiratory symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g., dyspnea, cough, and fever). Immediately withhold ALECENSA treatment in patients diagnosed with ILD/pneumonitis and permanently discontinue ALECENSA if no other potential causes of ILD/pneumonitis have been identified [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  and  Adverse Reactions (6)  ]  .



    5.3 Renal Impairment



   Renal impairment occurred in 8% of patients in Studies NP28761, NP28673, and ALEX. The incidence of Grade &gt;= 3 renal impairment was 1.7%, of which 0.5% were fatal events. Dose modifications for renal impairment were required in 3.2% of patients. Median time to Grade &gt;= 3 renal impairment was 3.7 months (range 0.5 to 14.7 months).  



  Permanently discontinue ALECENSA for Grade 4 renal toxicity. Withhold ALECENSA for Grade 3 renal toxicity until recovery to less than or equal to 1.5 times ULN, then resume at reduced dose [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .  



    5.4 Bradycardia



   Symptomatic bradycardia can occur with ALECENSA. Cases of bradycardia (8.6%) have been reported in patients treated with ALECENSA in Studies NP28761, NP28673 and ALEX. Eighteen percent of 365 patients treated with ALECENSA for whom serial ECGs were available had heart rates of less than 50 beats per minute (bpm).  



 Monitor heart rate and blood pressure regularly. Dose modification is not required in cases of asymptomatic bradycardia. In cases of symptomatic bradycardia that is not life-threatening, withhold ALECENSA until recovery to asymptomatic bradycardia or to a heart rate of 60 bpm or above and evaluate concomitant medications known to cause bradycardia, as well as anti-hypertensive medications. If attributable to a concomitant medication, resume ALECENSA at a reduced dose (see  Table 1  ) upon recovery to asymptomatic bradycardia or to a heart rate of 60 bpm or above, with frequent monitoring as clinically indicated. Permanently discontinue ALECENSA in case of recurrence. Permanently discontinue ALECENSA in cases of life-threatening bradycardia if no contributing concomitant medication is identified [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ].  



    5.5 Severe Myalgia and Creatine Phosphokinase (CPK) Elevation



   Myalgia or musculoskeletal pain occurred in 26% of patients in Studies NP28761, NP28673 and ALEX. The incidence of Grade 3 myalgia/musculoskeletal pain was 0.7%. Dose modifications for myalgia/musculoskeletal pain were required in 0.5% of patients.  



  Elevations of CPK occurred in 41% of 347 patients with CPK laboratory data available in Studies NP28761, NP28673 and ALEX. The incidence of Grade 3 elevations of CPK was 4.0%. Median time to Grade 3 CPK elevation was 14 days (interquartile range 13-28 days). Dose modifications for elevation of CPK occurred in 3.2 % of patients.  



 Advise patients to report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness. Assess CPK levels every 2 weeks for the first month of treatment and as clinically indicated in patients reporting symptoms. Based on the severity of the CPK elevation, withhold ALECENSA, then resume or reduce dose [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ].  



    5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, ALECENSA can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Administration of alectinib to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryo-fetal toxicity and abortion at maternally toxic doses with exposures approximately 2.7 times those observed in humans with alectinib 600 mg twice daily. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.



 Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ALECENSA and for 1 week following the final dose [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1  and  8.3)  and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)  ]  .
