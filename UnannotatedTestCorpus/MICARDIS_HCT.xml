  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 MICARDIS HCT has been evaluated for safety in more than 1700 patients, including 716 treated for hypertension for longer than 6 months and 420 for more than 1 year. Adverse reactions have been limited to those that have been previously reported with telmisartan and/or hydrochlorothiazide.



 Adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of &gt;=2% in patients treated with telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide and at a greater rate than in patients treated with placebo, are presented in Table 1  [see Clinical Studies (  14  )].  



 Table 1 Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of &gt;=2% in Patients Treated with Telmisartan/Hydrochlorothiazide and at a Greater Rate Than in Patients Treated with Placebo*

      Other adverse reactions observed for telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide were: pain (including back and abdominal), dyspepsia, erythema, vomiting, bronchitis, and pharyngitis.
 

 Adverse reactions occurred at approximately the same rates in men and women, older and younger patients, and black and non-black patients.

   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of MICARDIS HCT. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

</Section>
    <Section id="S3" name="warnings and precautions">    5  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Avoid fetal or neonatal exposure (  5.1  ) 
 *  Correct volume or salt depletion before initiating therapy. Observe for signs and symptoms of hypotension (  5.2  ) 
 *  Monitor renal function and potassium in susceptible patients (  5.3  )

   5.1 Fetal Toxicity



    Telmisartan    Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue MICARDIS HCT as soon as possible.
 

   Hydrochlorothiazide    Thiazides cross the placental barrier and appear in cord blood. Adverse reactions include fetal or neonatal jaundice and thrombocytopenia [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  )].  
 

    5.2 Hypotension in Volume- or Salt-Depleted Patients



  In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system, such as volume- or salt-depleted patients (e.g., those being treated with high doses of diuretics), symptomatic hypotension may occur after initialization of treatment with MICARDIS HCT. Correct volume or salt depletion prior to administration of MICARDIS HCT.



    5.3 Impaired Renal Function



  Changes in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and by diuretics. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe congestive heart failure, or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing oliguria, progressive azotemia, or acute renal failure on MICARDIS HCT. Monitor renal function periodically in these patients. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on MICARDIS HCT.



    5.4 Electrolytes and Metabolic Disorders



  Drugs, including telmisartan, that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with renal insufficiency, diabetes, or combination use with other angiotensin receptor blockers or ACE inhibitors and the concomitant use of other drugs that raise serum potassium levels [see Drug Interactions (  7.1  ,  7.4  )]  .



 Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Thiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium; this may result in hypomagnesemia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which may be difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically.



 In controlled trials using the telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination treatment, no patient administered 40 mg/12.5 mg, 80 mg/12.5 mg, or 80 mg/25 mg experienced a decrease in potassium &gt;=1.4 mEq/L, and no patient experienced hyperkalemia.



 Hydrochlorothiazide decreases urinary calcium excretion and may cause elevations of serum calcium.



 Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.



 Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy. Because telmisartan decreases uric acid, telmisartan in combination with hydrochlorothiazide attenuates the diuretic-induced hyperuricemia.



    5.5 Hypersensitivity Reaction



    Hydrochlorothiazide    Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history [see Contraindications (  4  )].  
 

    5.6 Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle-Closure Glaucoma



  Hydrochlorothiazide, a sulfonamide, can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in acute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue hydrochlorothiazide as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy.



    5.7 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus



  Thiazide diuretics have been reported to cause exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus.



    5.8 Postsympathectomy Patients



  The antihypertensive effects of hydrochlorothiazide may be enhanced in the postsympathectomy patient.
