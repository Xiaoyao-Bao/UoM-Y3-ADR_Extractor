    BOXED WARNING: 

  

  Cardiovascular Risk



 *  NSAIDs may cause an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which can be fatal. This risk may increase with duration of use. Patients with cardiovascular disease or risk factors for cardiovascular disease may be at a greater risk. (See WARNINGS). 
   *  RELAFEN is contraindicated for the treatment of peri-operative pain in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery (see WARNINGS). 
    Gastrointestinal Risk
 

 *  NSAIDs cause an increased risk of serious gastrointestinal adverse events including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines, which can be fatal. These events can occur at any time during use and without warning symptoms. Elderly patients are at greater risk for serious gastrointestinal events (see WARNINGS). 
    
 



    BOXED WARNING: Medication Guide for Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)

  Medication Guide for Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)

    (see the end of this Medication Guide for a list of prescription NSAID medicines.)   



   What is the most important information I should know about medicines called Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)?  



   NSAID medicines may increase the chance of a heart attack or stroke that can lead to death.   This chance increases:



 *  with longer use of NSAID medicines 
 *  in people who have heart disease 
      NSAID medicines should never be used right before or after a heart surgery called a "coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)".  
 

   NSAID medicines can cause ulcers and bleeding in the stomach and intestines at any time during treatment.  



    Ulcers and bleeding:   



 *  can happen without warning symptoms 
 *  may cause death 
       The chance of a person getting an ulcer or bleeding increases with:  
 

 *  taking medicines called "corticosteroids" and "anticoagulants" 
 *  longer use 
 *  smoking 
 *  drinking alcohol 
 *  older age 
 *  having poor health 
      NSAID medicines should only be used:  
 

 *  exactly as prescribed 
 *  at the lowest dose possible for your treatment 
 *  for the shortest time needed 
      What are Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)?  
 

 NSAID medicines are used to treat pain and redness, swelling, and heat (inflammation) from medical conditions such as:



 *  different types of arthritis 
 *  menstrual cramps and other types of short-term pain 
      Who should not take a Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID)?  
 

   Do not take an NSAID medicine:  



 *  if you had an asthma attack, hives, or other allergic reaction with aspirin or any other NSAID medicine 
 *  for pain right before or after heart bypass surgery 
      Tell your healthcare provider:   
 

 *  about all of your medical conditions 
 *  about all of the medicines you take. NSAIDs and some other medicines can interact with each other and cause serious side effects. Keep a list of your medicines to show to your healthcare provider and pharmacist. 
 *  If you are pregnant. NSAID medicines should not be used by pregnant women late in their pregnancy. 
 *  If you are breastfeeding. Talk to your doctor. 
      What are the possible side effects of Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)?  
 

   Serious side effects include:



 *  heart attack 
   *  stroke 
   *  high blood pressure 
   *  heart failure from body swelling (fluid retention) 
   *  kidney problems including kidney failure 
   *  bleeding and ulcers in the stomach and intestine 
   *  low red blood cells (anemia) 
   *  life-threatening skin reactions 
   *  life-threatening allergic reactions 
   *  liver problems including liver 
   *  failure 
   *  asthma attacks in people who have asthmaOther side effects include:stomach painconstipationdiarrheagasheartburnnauseavomitingdizziness 
        Get emergency help right away if you have any of the following symptoms:  
 

  
 shortness of breath or trouble breathingchest painweakness in one part or side of your body  slurred speechswelling of the face or throat   
          Stop your NSAID medicine and call your healthcare provider right away if you have any of the following symptoms:

        These are not all the side effects with NSAID medicines. Talk to your healthcare provider or pharmacist for more information about NSAID medicines.
 

   Other information about Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)  



 *  Aspirin is an NSAID medicine but it does not increase the chance of a heart attack. Aspirin can cause bleeding in the brain, stomach, and intestines. Aspirin can also cause ulcers in the stomach and intestines. 
 *  Some of these NSAID medicines are sold in lower doses without a prescription (over-the-counter). Talk to your healthcare provider before using over-the-counter NSAIDs for more than 10 days.

   General



   RELAFEN cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids may lead to disease exacerbation. Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is made to discontinue corticosteroids.



 The pharmacological activity of RELAFEN in reducing fever and inflammation may diminish the utility of these diagnostic signs in detecting complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions.    



    Hepatic Effects



  Borderline elevations of 1 or more liver function tests may occur in up to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs including RELAFEN. These laboratory abnormalities may progress, may remain unchanged, or may be transient with continuing therapy. Notable elevations of ALT or AST (approximately 3 or more times the upper limit of normal) have been reported in approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials with NSAIDs. In addition, rare cases of severe hepatic reactions, including jaundice and fatal fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis and hepatic failure, some of them with fatal outcomes have been reported. A patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom an abnormal liver test has occurred, should be evaluated for evidence of the development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapy with RELAFEN. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), RELAFEN should be discontinued.    



    Hematological Effects



   Anemia is sometimes seen in patients receiving NSAIDS, including RELAFEN. This may be due to fluid retention, occult or gross GI blood loss, or an incompletely described effect upon erythropoiesis. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs, including RELAFEN, should have their hemoglobin or hematocrit checked if they exhibit any signs or symptoms of anemia.



 NSAIDs inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolong bleeding time in some patients. Unlike aspirin, their effect on platelet function is quantitatively less, of shorter duration, and reversible. Patients receiving RELAFEN who may be adversely affected by alterations in platelet function, such as those with coagulation disorders or patients receiving anticoagulants, should be carefully monitored (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Special Studies, Other  ).



    Preexisting Asthma



   Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use of aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with severe bronchospasm which can be fatal. Since cross reactivity, including bronchospasm, between aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, RELAFEN should not be administered to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and should be used with caution in patients with preexisting asthma.



    Photosensitivity



  Based on ultraviolet (U.V.) light photosensitivity testing, RELAFEN may be associated with more reactions to sun exposure than might be expected based on skin tanning types.



    Information for Patients



   Patients should be informed of the following information before initiating therapy with an NSAID and periodically during the course of ongoing therapy. Patients should also be encouraged to read the NSAID Medication Guide that accompanies each prescription dispensed.  



 *  RELAFEN, like other NSAIDs, may cause serious CV side effects, such as MI or stroke, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious CV events can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, slurring of speech, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative signs or symptoms. Patients should be apprised of the importance of this follow-up (see WARNINGS, Cardiovascular Effects). 
 *  RELAFEN, like other NSAIDs, can cause GI discomfort and, rarely, serious GI side effects, such as ulcers and bleeding, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms including epigastric pain, dyspepsia, melena, and hematemesis. Patients should be apprised of the importance of this follow-up (see WARNINGS, Gastrointestinal Effects--Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation). 
 *  RELAFEN, like other NSAIDs, may cause serious skin side effects such as exfoliative dermatitis, SJS, and TEN, which may result in hospitalizations and even death. Although serious skin reactions may occur without warning, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of skin rash and blisters, fever, or other signs of hypersensitivity such as itching, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative signs or symptoms. Patients should be advised to stop the drug immediately if they develop any type of rash and contact their physicians as soon as possible. 
 *  Patients should promptly report signs or symptoms of unexplained weight gain or edema to their physicians. 
 *  Patients should be informed of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flu-like" symptoms). If these occur, patients should be instructed to stop therapy and seek immediate medical therapy. 
 *  Patients should be informed of the signs of an anaphylactoid reaction (e.g. difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat). If these occur, patients should be instructed to seek immediate emergency help (see WARNINGS). 
 *  In late pregnancy, as with other NSAIDs, RELAFEN should be avoided because it will cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus. 
       Laboratory Tests
 

  Because serious G.I. tract ulceration and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs and symptoms of GI bleeding. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs, should have their CBC and a chemistry profile checked periodically. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver or renal disease develop, systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.) or if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, RELAFEN should be discontinued.



    Drug Interactions



   ACE-inhibitors



  Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE-inhibitors. This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE-inhibitors.



    Aspirin



      When RELAFEN is administered with aspirin, its protein binding is reduced, although the clearance of free RELAFEN is not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known; however, as with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of nabumetone and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects.



    Diuretics



      Clinical studies, as well as post marketing observations, have shown that RELAFEN can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely for signs of renal failure (see PRECAUTIONS, Renal Effects), as well as to assure diuretic efficacy.



    Lithium



      NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID. Thus, when NSAIDs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity.



    Methotrexate



      NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that they could enhance the toxicity of methotrexate. Caution should be used when NSAIDs are administered concomitantly with methotrexate.



    Warfarin



      The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are synergistic, such that users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI bleeding higher than users of either drug alone.



 In vitro studies have shown that, because of its affinity for protein, 6MNA may displace other protein-bound drugs from their binding site. Caution should be exercised when administering RELAFEN with warfarin since interactions have been seen with other NSAIDs.



 Concomitant administration of an aluminum-containing antacid had no significant effect on the bioavailability of 6MNA. When administered with food or milk, there is more rapid absorption; however, the total amount of 6MNA in the plasma is unchanged (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics).



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis



   In 2-year studies conducted in mice and rats, nabumetone had no statistically significant tumorigenic effect. Nabumetone did not show mutagenic potential in the Ames test and mouse micronucleus test in vivo; however, nabumetone- and 6MNA-treated lymphocytes in culture showed chromosomal aberrations at 80 mcg/mL and higher concentrations (equal to the average human exposure to RELAFEN at the maximum recommended dose).



    Impairment of Fertility



  Nabumetone did not impair fertility of male or female rats treated orally at doses of 320 mg/kg/day (1,888 mg/m  2  ) before mating.



    Pregnancy



   



    Teratogenic Effects



       Pregnancy Category C    .    Reproductive studies conducted in rats and rabbits have not demonstrated evidence of developmental abnormalities. However, animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response. There are no adequate, well-controlled studies in pregnant women. RELAFEN should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.



    Nonteratogenic Effects



      Because of the known effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the fetal cardiovascular system (closure of ductus arteriosus), use during pregnancy (particularly late pregnancy) should be avoided.



    Labor and Delivery



  In rat studies with NSAIDs, as with other drugs known to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, an increased incidence of dystocia, delayed parturition, and decreased pup survival occurred. The effects of RELAFEN on labor and delivery in pregnant women are unknown.



    Nursing Mothers



  It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk, however 6MNA is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from RELAFEN, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.



    Pediatric Use



  Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.



    Geriatric Use



  As with any NSAIDs, caution should be exercised in treating the elderly (65 years and older). Of the 1,677 patients in US clinical studies who were treated with RELAFEN, 411 patients (24%) were 65 years or older; 22 patients (1%) were 75 years or older. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between these older patients and younger ones. Similar results were observed in a 1-year, non-US postmarketing surveillance study of 10,800 patients treated with RELAFEN, of whom 4,577 patients (42%) were 65 years or older.
