  Use of Xolair has been associated with:

 *  Anaphylaxis [ see  Boxed Warning  and  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)   ] 
 *  Malignancies [ see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)   ] 
   *   Asthma : The most common adverse reactions in clinical studies with adult and adolescent patients &gt;=12 years of age were arthralgia, pain (general), leg pain, fatigue, dizziness, fracture, arm pain, pruritus, dermatitis, and earache. In clinical studies with pediatric patients 6 to &lt;12 years of age, the most common adverse reactions were nasopharyngitis, headache, pyrexia, upper abdominal pain, pharyngitis streptococcal, otitis media, viral gastroenteritis, arthropod bites, and epistaxis. (  6.1  ) 
 *   Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria : The most common adverse reactions (&gt;=2% Xolair-treated patients and more frequent than in placebo) included the following: nausea, nasopharyngitis, sinusitis, upper respiratory tract infection, viral upper respiratory tract infection, arthralgia, headache, and cough.

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

     Adverse Reactions from Clinical Studies in Adult and Adolescent Patients 12 Years of Age and Older with Asthma  

 The data described below reflect Xolair exposure for 2076 adult and adolescent patients ages 12 and older, including 1687 patients exposed for six months and 555 exposed for one year or more, in either placebo-controlled or other controlled asthma studies. The mean age of patients receiving Xolair was 42 years, with 134 patients 65 years of age or older; 60% were women, and 85% Caucasian. Patients received Xolair 150 to 375 mg every 2 or 4 weeks or, for patients assigned to control groups, standard therapy with or without a placebo.

 The adverse events most frequently resulting in clinical intervention (e.g., discontinuation of Xolair, or the need for concomitant medication to treat an adverse event) were injection site reaction (45%), viral infections (23%), upper respiratory tract infection (20%), sinusitis (16%), headache (15%), and pharyngitis (11%). These events were observed at similar rates in Xolair-treated patients and control patients.

   Table 5  shows adverse reactions from four placebo-controlled asthma trials that occurred &gt;= 1% and more frequently in adult and adolescent patients 12 years of age and older receiving Xolair than in those receiving placebo. Adverse events were classified using preferred terms from the International Medical Nomenclature (IMN) dictionary. Injection site reactions were recorded separately from the reporting of other adverse events.

         There were no differences in the incidence of adverse reactions based on age (among patients under 65), gender or race.
 

     Anaphylaxis Case Control Study  

 A retrospective case-control study investigated risk factors for anaphylaxis to Xolair among patients treated with Xolair for asthma. Cases with an adjudicated history of anaphylaxis to Xolair were compared to controls with no such history. The study found that a self-reported history of anaphylaxis to foods, medications or other causes was more common among patients with Xolair anaphylaxis (57% of 30 cases) compared to controls (23% of 88 controls) [OR 8.1, 95% CI 2.7 to 24.3]. Because this is a case control study, the study cannot provide the incidence of anaphylaxis among Xolair users. From other sources, anaphylaxis to Xolair was observed in 0.1% of patients in clinical trials and at least 0.2% of patients based upon postmarketing reports [see    Warnings and Precautions (5.1)    ,    Adverse Reactions (6.3)    ].

     Injection Site Reactions  

 In adults and adolescents, injection site reactions of any severity occurred at a rate of 45% in Xolair-treated patients compared with 43% in placebo-treated patients. The types of injection site reactions included: bruising, redness, warmth, burning, stinging, itching, hive formation, pain, indurations, mass, and inflammation.

 Severe injection site reactions occurred more frequently in Xolair-treated patients compared with patients in the placebo group (12% versus 9%).

 The majority of injection site reactions occurred within 1 hour-post injection, lasted less than 8 days, and generally decreased in frequency at subsequent dosing visits.

     Adverse Reactions from Clinical Studies in Pediatric Patients 6 to &lt;12 Years of Age with Asthma  

 The data described below reflect Xolair exposure for 926 patients 6 to &lt; 12 years of age, including 583 patients exposed for six months and 292 exposed for one year or more, in either placebo-controlled or other controlled asthma studies. The mean age of pediatric patients receiving Xolair was 8.8 years; 69% were male, and 64% were Caucasian. Pediatric patients received Xolair 75 mg to 375 mg every 2 or 4 weeks or, for patients assigned to control groups, standard therapy with or without a placebo. No cases of malignancy were reported in patients treated with Xolair in these trials.

 The most common adverse reactions occurring at &gt;=3% in the pediatric patients receiving Xolair and more frequently than in patients treated with placebo were nasopharyngitis, headache, pyrexia, upper abdominal pain, pharyngitis streptococcal, otitis media, viral gastroenteritis, arthropod bite, and epistaxis.

 The adverse events most frequently resulting in clinical intervention (e.g., discontinuation of Xolair, or the need for concomitant medication to treat an adverse event) were bronchitis (0.2%), headache (0.2%) and urticaria (0.2%). These events were observed at similar rates in Xolair-treated patients and control patients.

     Adverse Reactions from Clinical Studies in Patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria (CIU)  

 The safety of Xolair for the treatment of CIU was assessed in three placebo-controlled, multiple-dose clinical trials of 12 weeks' (CIU Trial 2) and 24 weeks' duration (CIU Trials 1 and 3). In CIU Trials 1 and 2, patients received Xolair 75, 150, or 300 mg or placebo every 4 weeks in addition to their baseline level of H1 antihistamine therapy throughout the treatment period. In CIU Trial 3 patients were randomized to Xolair 300 mg or placebo every 4 weeks in addition to their baseline level of H1 antihistamine therapy. The data described below reflect Xolair exposure for 733 patients enrolled and receiving at least one dose of Xolair in the three clinical trials, including 684 patients exposed for 12 weeks and 427 exposed for 24 weeks. The mean age of patients receiving Xolair 300 mg was 43 years, 75% were women, and 89% were white. The demographic profiles for patients receiving Xolair 150 mg and 75 mg were similar.

   Table 6  shows adverse reactions that occurred in &gt;= 2% of patients receiving Xolair (150 or 300 mg) and more frequently than those receiving placebo. Adverse reactions are pooled from Trial 2 and the first 12 weeks of Trials 1 and 3.

          Additional reactions reported during the 24 week treatment period in Trials 1 and 3 [&gt;=2% of patients receiving Xolair (150 or 300 mg) and more frequently than those receiving placebo] included: toothache, fungal infection, urinary tract infection, myalgia, pain in extremity, musculoskeletal pain, peripheral edema, pyrexia, migraine, sinus headache, anxiety, oropharyngeal pain, asthma, urticaria, and alopecia.
 

     Injection Site Reactions  

 Injection site reactions of any severity occurred during the studies in more Xolair-treated patients [11 patients (2.7%) at 300 mg, 1 patient (0.6%) at 150 mg] compared with 2 placebo-treated patients (0.8%). The types of injection site reactions included: swelling, erythema, pain, bruising, itching, bleeding and urticaria. None of the events resulted in study discontinuation or treatment interruption.

     Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Events from Clinical Studies in Patients with Asthma  

 A 5-year observational cohort study was conducted in patients &gt;= 12 years of age with moderate to severe persistent asthma and a positive skin test reaction to a perennial aeroallergen to evaluate the long term safety of Xolair, including the risk of malignancy [  see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)    ]. A total of 5007 Xolair-treated and 2829 non-Xolair-treated patients enrolled in the study. Similar percentages of patients in both cohorts were current (5%) or former smokers (29%). Patients had a mean age of 45 years and were followed for a mean of 3.7 years. More Xolair-treated patients were diagnosed with severe asthma (50%) compared to the non-Xolair-treated patients (23%) and 44% of patients prematurely discontinued the study. Additionally, 88% of patients in the Xolair-treated cohort had been previously exposed to Xolair for a mean of 8 months.

 A higher incidence rate (per 1000 patient-years) of overall cardiovascular and cerebrovascular serious adverse events (SAEs) was observed in Xolair-treated patients (13.4) compared to non-Xolair-treated patients (8.1). Increases in rates were observed for transient ischemic attack (0.7 versus 0.1), myocardial infarction (2.1 versus 0.8), pulmonary hypertension (0.5 versus 0), pulmonary embolism/venous thrombosis (3.2 versus 1.5), and unstable angina (2.2 versus 1.4), while the rates observed for ischemic stroke and cardiovascular death were similar among both study cohorts. The results suggest a potential increased risk of serious cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Xolair. However, the observational study design, the inclusion of patients previously exposed to Xolair (88%), baseline imbalances in cardiovascular risk factors between the treatment groups, an inability to adjust for unmeasured risk factors, and the high study discontinuation rate limit the ability to quantify the magnitude of the risk.

 A pooled analysis of 25 randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 8 to 52 weeks in duration was conducted to further evaluate the imbalance in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular SAEs noted in the above observational cohort study. A total of 3342 Xolair-treated patients and 2895 placebo-treated patients were included in the pooled analysis. The patients had a mean age of 38 years, and were followed for a mean duration of 6.8 months. No notable imbalances were observed in the rates of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular SAEs listed above. However, the results of the pooled analysis were based on a low number of events, slightly younger patients, and shorter duration of follow-up than the observational cohort study; therefore, the results are insufficient to confirm or reject the findings noted in the observational cohort study.

   6.2 Immunogenicity

  Antibodies to Xolair were detected in approximately 1/1723 (&lt; 0.1%) of patients treated with Xolair in the clinical studies evaluated for approval of asthma in patients 12 years of age and older. In three pediatric studies, antibodies to Xolair were detected in one patient out of 581 patients 6 to &lt;12 years of age treated with Xolair and evaluated for antibodies. There were no detectable antibodies in the patients treated in the phase 3 CIU clinical trials, but due to levels of Xolair at the time of anti-therapeutic antibody sampling and missing samples for some patients, antibodies to Xolair could only have been determined in 88% of the 733 patients treated in these clinical studies. The data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were considered positive for antibodies to Xolair in ELISA assays and are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assays. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody positivity in the assay may be influenced by several factors including sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. Therefore, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to Xolair with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.

   6.3 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Xolair in adult and adolescent patients 12 years of age and older. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

   Anaphylaxis:  Based on spontaneous reports and an estimated exposure of about 57,300 patients from June 2003 through December 2006, the frequency of anaphylaxis attributed to Xolair use was estimated to be at least 0.2% of patients. Diagnostic criteria of anaphylaxis were skin or mucosal tissue involvement, and, either airway compromise, and/or reduced blood pressure with or without associated symptoms, and a temporal relationship to Xolair administration with no other identifiable cause. Signs and symptoms in these reported cases included bronchospasm, hypotension, syncope, urticaria, angioedema of the throat or tongue, dyspnea, cough, chest tightness, and/or cutaneous angioedema. Pulmonary involvement was reported in 89% of the cases. Hypotension or syncope was reported in 14% of cases. Fifteen percent of the reported cases resulted in hospitalization. A previous history of anaphylaxis unrelated to Xolair was reported in 24% of the cases.

 Of the reported cases of anaphylaxis attributed to Xolair, 39% occurred with the first dose, 19% occurred with the second dose, 10% occurred with the third dose, and the rest after subsequent doses. One case occurred after 39 doses (after 19 months of continuous therapy, anaphylaxis occurred when treatment was restarted following a 3 month gap). The time to onset of anaphylaxis in these cases was up to 30 minutes in 35%, greater than 30 and up to 60 minutes in 16%, greater than 60 and up to 90 minutes in 2%, greater than 90 and up to 120 minutes in 6%, greater than 2 hours and up to 6 hours in 5%, greater than 6 hours and up to 12 hours in 14%, greater than 12 hours and up to 24 hours in 8%, and greater than 24 hours and up to 4 days in 5%. In 9% of cases the times to onset were unknown.

 Twenty-three patients who experienced anaphylaxis were rechallenged with Xolair and 18 patients had a recurrence of similar symptoms of anaphylaxis. In addition, anaphylaxis occurred upon rechallenge with Xolair in 4 patients who previously experienced urticaria only.

   Eosinophilic Conditions  : Eosinophilic conditions have been reported [  see  Warnings and Precautions (5.5)    ].

   Fever, Arthralgia, and Rash  : A constellation of signs and symptoms including arthritis/arthralgia, rash (urticaria or other forms), fever and lymphadenopathy similar to serum sickness have been reported in post-approval use of Xolair [  see  Warnings and Precautions (5.6)    ].

   Hematologic  : Severe thrombocytopenia has been reported.

   Skin  : Hair loss has been reported.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING:  ANAPHYLAXIS

    WARNING:  ANAPHYLAXIS  

    Anaphylaxis presenting as bronchospasm, hypotension, syncope, urticaria, and/or angioedema of the throat or tongue, has been reported to occur after administration of Xolair. Anaphylaxis has occurred as early as after the first dose of Xolair, but also has occurred beyond 1 year after beginning regularly administered treatment. Because of the risk of anaphylaxis, observe patients closely for an appropriate period of time after Xolair administration. Health care providers administering Xolair should be prepared to manage anaphylaxis that can be life-threatening. Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis and instruct them to seek immediate medical care should symptoms occur [  see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)   and   Adverse Reactions (6.1  ,   6.3)    ].

   5.1 Anaphylaxis

  Anaphylaxis has been reported to occur after administration of Xolair in premarketing clinical trials and in postmarketing spontaneous reports [ see  Boxed Warning  and  Adverse Reactions (6.3)    ]. Signs and symptoms in these reported cases have included bronchospasm, hypotension, syncope, urticaria, and/or angioedema of the throat or tongue. Some of these events have been life-threatening. In premarketing clinical trials in patients with asthma, anaphylaxis was reported in 3 of 3507 (0.1%) patients. Anaphylaxis occurred with the first dose of Xolair in two patients and with the fourth dose in one patient. The time to onset of anaphylaxis was 90 minutes after administration in two patients and 2 hours after administration in one patient.

 A case-control study showed that, among Xolair users, patients with a history of anaphylaxis to foods, medications, or other causes were at increased risk of anaphylaxis associated with Xolair, compared to those with no prior history of anaphylaxis [see   Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ].

 In postmarketing spontaneous reports, the frequency of anaphylaxis attributed to Xolair use was estimated to be at least 0.2% of patients based on an estimated exposure of about 57,300 patients from June 2003 through December 2006. Anaphylaxis has occurred as early as after the first dose of Xolair, but also has occurred beyond one year after beginning regularly scheduled treatment.

 Administer Xolair only in a healthcare setting by healthcare providers prepared to manage anaphylaxis that can be life-threatening. Observe patients closely for an appropriate period of time after administration of Xolair, taking into account the time to onset of anaphylaxis seen in premarketing clinical trials and postmarketing spontaneous reports [see  Adverse Reactions (6)  ]. Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis, and instruct them to seek immediate medical care should signs or symptoms occur.

 Discontinue Xolair in patients who experience a severe hypersensitivity reaction [ see  Contraindications (4)    ].

    5.2 Malignancy

  Malignant neoplasms were observed in 20 of 4127 (0.5%) Xolair-treated patients compared with 5 of 2236 (0.2%) control patients in clinical studies of adults and adolescents &gt;= 12 years of age with asthma and other allergic disorders. The observed malignancies in Xolair-treated patients were a variety of types, with breast, non-melanoma skin, prostate, melanoma, and parotid occurring more than once, and five other types occurring once each. The majority of patients were observed for less than 1 year. The impact of longer exposure to Xolair or use in patients at higher risk for malignancy (e.g., elderly, current smokers) is not known.

 In a subsequent observational study of 5007 Xolair-treated and 2829 non-Xolair-treated adolescent and adult patients with moderate to severe persistent asthma and a positive skin test reaction or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen, patients were followed for up to 5 years. In this study, the incidence rates of primary malignancies (per 1000 patient years) were similar among Xolair-treated (12.3) and non-Xolair-treated patients (13.0) [ see  Adverse Reactions (6)    ]. However, study limitations preclude definitively ruling out a malignancy risk with Xolair. Study limitations include: the observational study design, the bias introduced by allowing enrollment of patients previously exposed to Xolair (88%), enrollment of patients (56%) while a history of cancer or a premalignant condition were study exclusion criteria, and the high study discontinuation rate (44%).

    5.3 Acute Asthma Symptoms

  Xolair has not been shown to alleviate asthma exacerbations acutely. Do not use Xolair to treat acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus.

    5.4 Corticosteroid Reduction

  Do not discontinue systemic or inhaled corticosteroids abruptly upon initiation of Xolair therapy for asthma. Decrease corticosteroids gradually under the direct supervision of a physician. In CIU patients, the use of Xolair in combination with corticosteroids has not been evaluated.

    5.5 Eosinophilic Conditions

  In rare cases, patients with asthma on therapy with Xolair may present with serious systemic eosinophilia sometimes presenting with clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome, a condition which is often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These events usually, but not always, have been associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. Physicians should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients. A causal association between Xolair and these underlying conditions has not been established.

    5.6 Fever, Arthralgia, and Rash

  In post-approval use, some patients have experienced a constellation of signs and symptoms including arthritis/arthralgia, rash, fever and lymphadenopathy with an onset 1 to 5 days after the first or subsequent injections of Xolair. These signs and symptoms have recurred after additional doses in some patients. Although circulating immune complexes or a skin biopsy consistent with a Type III reaction were not seen with these cases, these signs and symptoms are similar to those seen in patients with serum sickness. Physicians should stop Xolair if a patient develops this constellation of signs and symptoms [ see  Adverse Reactions (6.3)    ].

    5.7 Parasitic (Helminth) Infection

  Monitor patients at high risk of geohelminth infection while on Xolair therapy. Insufficient data are available to determine the length of monitoring required for geohelminth infections after stopping Xolair treatment.

 In a one-year clinical trial conducted in Brazil in adult and adolescent patients at high risk for geohelminthic infections (roundworm, hookworm, whipworm, threadworm), 53% (36/68) of Xolair-treated patients experienced an infection, as diagnosed by standard stool examination, compared to 42% (29/69) of placebo controls. The point estimate of the odds ratio for infection was 1.96, with a 95% confidence interval (0.88, 4.36) indicating that in this study a patient who had an infection was anywhere from 0.88 to 4.36 times as likely to have received Xolair than a patient who did not have an infection. Response to appropriate anti-geohelminth treatment of infection as measured by stool egg counts was not different between treatment groups.

    5.8 Laboratory Tests

  Serum total IgE levels increase following administration of Xolair due to formation of Xolair:IgE complexes [ see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)    ]. Elevated serum total IgE levels may persist for up to 1 year following discontinuation of Xolair. Do not use serum total IgE levels obtained less than 1 year following discontinuation to reassess the dosing regimen for asthma patients, because these levels may not reflect steady state free IgE levels [ see  Dosage and Administration (2.1)    ].
