    Cardiovascular  : Blood pressure and pulse rate are frequently elevated following administration of KETALAR alone. However, hypotension and bradycardia have been observed. Arrhythmia has also occurred.



   Respiration  : Although respiration is frequently stimulated, severe depression of respiration or apnea may occur following rapid intravenous administration of high doses of KETALAR. Laryngospasms and other forms of airway obstruction have occurred during KETALAR anesthesia.



   Eye  : Diplopia and nystagmus have been noted following KETALAR administration. It also may cause a slight elevation in intraocular pressure measurement.



   Genitourinary:    In individuals with history of chronic ketamine use or abuse, lower urinary tract and bladder symptoms including dysuria, increased urinary frequency, urgency, urge incontinence, and hematuria have been reported (see    DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION     Section). In addition, diagnostic studies performed to assess the cause of these symptoms have reported cystitis (including cystitis non-infective, cystitis interstitial, cystitis ulcerative, cystitis erosive and cystitis hemorrhagic) as well as hydronephrosis and reduced bladder capacity.



   Psychological  : (See    Special Note    ).



   Neurological  : In some patients, enhanced skeletal muscle tone may be manifested by tonic and clonic movements sometimes resembling seizures (see    DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION    Section).



   Gastrointestinal  : Anorexia, nausea and vomiting have been observed; however, this is not usually severe and allows the great majority of patients to take liquids by mouth shortly after regaining consciousness (see    DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION    Section).



   General  : Anaphylaxis. Local pain and exanthema at the injection site have infrequently been reported. Transient erythema and/or morbilliform rash have also been reported.

    General  



  KETALAR should be used by or under the direction of physicians experienced in administering general anesthetics and in maintenance of an airway and in the control of respiration.



 Because pharyngeal and laryngeal reflexes are usually active, KETALAR should not be used alone in surgery or diagnostic procedures of the pharynx, larynx, or bronchial tree. Mechanical stimulation of the pharynx should be avoided, whenever possible, if KETALAR is used alone. Muscle relaxants, with proper attention to respiration, may be required in both of these instances.



 Resuscitative equipment should be ready for use.



 The incidence of emergence reactions may be reduced  if verbal and tactile stimulation of the patient is minimized during the recovery period. This does not preclude the monitoring of vital signs (see   Special Note    ).



 The intravenous dose should be administered over a period of 60 seconds. More rapid administration may result in respiratory depression or apnea and enhanced pressor response.



 In surgical procedures involving visceral pain pathways, KETALAR should be supplemented with an agent which obtunds visceral pain.



 Use with caution in the chronic alcoholic and the acutely alcohol-intoxicated patient.



 An increase in cerebrospinal fluid pressure has been reported following administration of ketamine hydrochloride. Use with extreme caution in patients with preanesthetic elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure.



      Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility    
 

   Carcinogenesis   



 Long-term animal studies have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of ketamine.



  Mutagenesis  



 In a published report, ketamine was clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay.



  Impairment of Fertility  



 Adequate studies to evaluate the impact of ketamine on male or female fertility have not been conducted.  Male and female rats were treated with 10 mg/kg ketamine IV (0.8 times the average human induction dose of 2 mg/kg IV based on body surface area) on Days 11, 10, and 9 prior to mating.  No impact on fertility was noted; however, this study design does not adequately characterize the impact of a drug on fertility endpoints.



      Pregnancy    
 

     Risk Summary    
 

  There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of KETALAR in pregnant women.  In animal reproduction studies in rats developmental delays (hypoplasia of skeletal tissues) were noted at 0.3 times the human intramuscular dose of 10 mg/kg.  In rabbits, developmental delays and increased fetal resorptions were noted at 0.6 times the human dose.  Published studies in pregnant primates demonstrate that the administration of anesthetic and sedation drugs that block NMDA receptors and/or potentiate GABA activity during the period of peak brain development increases neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain of the offspring when used for longer than 3 hours.  There are no data on pregnancy exposures in primates corresponding to periods prior to the third trimester in humans.



 The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.



      Clinical Considerations    
 

  Since the safe use in pregnancy, including obstetrics (either vaginal or abdominal delivery), has not been established, such use is not recommended (see   ANIMAL PHARMACOLOGY AND TOXICOLOGY    ).



      Data    
 

   Animal Data  



 Pregnant rats were treated intramuscularly with 20 mg/kg ketamine (0.3 times the human dose of 10 mg/kg IM based on body surface area) on either Gestation Days 6 to 10 or Gestation Days 11 to 15.  Ketamine treatment produced an increased incidence of hypoplastic skull, phalanges, and sternebrae in the pups.



 Pregnant rabbits were treated intramuscularly with 20 mg/kg ketamine (0.6 times the human dose of 10 mg/kg IM based on body surface area) on either Gestation Days 6 to 10 or Gestation Days 11 to 15.  An increase in resorptions and skeletal hypoplasia of the fetuses were noted.  Additional pregnant rabbits were treated intramuscularly with a single dose 60 mg/kg (1.9 times the human dose of 10 mg/kg IM based on body surface area) on Gestation Day 6 only.  Skeletal hypoplasia was reported in the fetuses.



 In a study where pregnant rats were treated intramuscularly with 20 mg/kg ketamine (0.3 times the human dose of 10 mg/kg IM based on body surface area) from Gestation Day 18 to 21.  There was a slight increase in incidence of delayed parturition by one day in treated dams of this group.  No adverse effects on the litters or pups were noted; however, learning and memory assessments were not completed. 



 Three pregnant beagle dogs were treated intramuscularly with 25 mg/kg ketamine (1.3 times the human dose of 10 mg/kg IM based on body surface area) twice weekly for the three weeks of the first, second, and third trimesters of pregnancy, respectively, without the development of adverse effects in the pups.



 In a published study in primates, administration of an anesthetic dose of ketamine for 24 hours on Gestation Day 122 increased neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain of the fetus. In other published studies, administration of either isoflurane or propofol for 5 hours on Gestation Day 120 resulted in increased neuronal and oligodendrocyte apoptosis in the developing brain of the offspring. With respect to brain development, this time period corresponds to the third trimester of gestation in the human. The clinical significance of these findings is not clear; however, studies in juvenile animals suggest neuroapoptosis correlates with long-term cognitive deficits. (See   WARNINGS/Pediatric Neurotoxicity  ,  Pediatric Use    , and   ANIMAL TOXICOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY    ).



     Information for Patients  



   Risk of Drowsiness  



 As appropriate, especially in cases where early discharge is possible, the duration of KETALAR and other drugs employed during the conduct of anesthesia should be considered. The patients should be cautioned that driving an automobile, operating hazardous machinery or engaging in hazardous activities should not be undertaken for 24 hours or more (depending upon the dosage of KETALAR and consideration of other drugs employed) after anesthesia.



     



  Effect of anesthetic and sedation drugs on early brain development  



 Studies conducted in young animals and children suggest repeated or prolonged use of general anesthetic or sedation drugs in children younger than 3 years may have negative effects on their developing brains. Discuss with parents and caregivers the benefits, risks, and timing and duration of surgery or procedures requiring anesthetic and sedation drugs (See   WARNINGS/Pediatric Neurotoxicity    ).



     Drug Interactions  



  Prolonged recovery time may occur if barbiturates and/or narcotics are used concurrently with KETALAR.



 KETALAR is clinically compatible with the commonly used general and local anesthetic agents when an adequate respiratory exchange is maintained.



     Geriatric Use  



  Clinical studies of ketamine hydrochloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.



     Pediatric Use  



  Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 16 have not been established.



 Published juvenile animal studies demonstrate that the administration of anesthetic and sedation drugs, such as KETALAR, that either block NMDA receptors or potentiate the activity of GABA during the period of rapid brain growth or synaptogenesis, results in widespread neuronal and oligodendrocyte cell loss in the developing brain and alterations in synaptic morphology and neurogenesis. Based on comparisons across species, the window of vulnerability to these changes is believed to correlate with exposures in the third trimester of gestation through the first several months of life, but may extend out to approximately 3 years of age in humans.



 In primates, exposure to 3 hours of ketamine that produced a light surgical plane of anesthesia did not increase neuronal cell loss, however, treatment regimens of 5 hours or longer of isoflurane increased neuronal cell loss. Data from isoflurane-treated rodents and ketamine-treated primates suggest that the neuronal and oligodendrocyte cell losses are associated with prolonged cognitive deficits in learning and memory. The clinical significance of these nonclinical findings is not known, and healthcare providers should balance the benefits of appropriate anesthesia in pregnant women, neonates, and young children who require procedures with the potential risks suggested by the nonclinical data. (See   WARNINGS      /     Pediatric Neurotoxicity    ,   Pregnancy    ).

  Cardiac function should be continually monitored during the procedure in patients found to have hypertension or cardiac decompensation.



 Postoperative confusional states may occur during the recovery period. (See   Special Note    ).



 Respiratory depression may occur with overdosage or too rapid a rate of administration of KETALAR, in which case supportive ventilation should be employed. Mechanical support of respiration is preferred to administration of analeptics.



      Pediatric Neurotoxicity    
 

  Published animal studies demonstrate that the administration of anesthetic and sedation drugs that block NMDA receptors and/or potentiate GABA activity increase neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain and result in long-term cognitive deficits when used for longer than 3 hours. The clinical significance of these findings is not clear. However, based on the available data, the window of vulnerability to these changes is believed to correlate with exposures in the third trimester of gestation through the first several months of life, but may extend out to approximately three years of age in humans. (See   PRECAUTIONS/       Pregnancy    ).



 Some published studies in children suggest that similar deficits may occur after repeated or prolonged exposures to anesthetic agents early in life and may result in adverse cognitive or behavioral effects. These studies have substantial limitations, and it is not clear if the observed effects are due to the anesthetic/sedation drug administration or other factors such as the surgery or underlying illness.



 Anesthetic and sedation drugs are a necessary part of the care of children needing surgery, other procedures, or tests that cannot be delayed, and no specific medications have been shown to be safer than any other. Decisions regarding the timing of any elective procedures requiring anesthesia should take into consideration the benefits of the procedure weighed against the potential risks.
