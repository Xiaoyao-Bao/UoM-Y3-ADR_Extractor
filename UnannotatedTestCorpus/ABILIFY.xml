  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

 The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling:

 *    Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis [see  BOXED WARNING  and  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)  ]  
 *    Cerebrovascular Adverse Events, Including Stroke [see  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2)  ]

    The most common adverse reactions in adult patients in clinical trials (&gt;=10%) were nausea, vomiting, constipation, headache, dizziness, akathisia, anxiety, insomnia, and restlessness.
 

 The most common adverse reactions in the pediatric clinical trials (&gt;=10%) were somnolence, headache, vomiting, extrapyramidal disorder, fatigue, increased appetite, insomnia, nausea, nasopharyngitis, and weight increased.

 ABILIFY has been evaluated for safety in 13,543 adult patients who participated in multiple-dose, clinical trials in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, Dementia of the Alzheimer's type, Parkinson's disease, and alcoholism, and who had approximately 7619 patient-years of exposure to oral ABILIFY and 749 patients with exposure to ABILIFY injection. A total of 3390 patients were treated with oral ABILIFY for at least 180 days and 1933 patients treated with oral ABILIFY had at least 1 year of exposure.

 ABILIFY has been evaluated for safety in 1,686 patients (6 to 18 years) who participated in multiple-dose, clinical trials in schizophrenia, bipolar mania, autistic disorder, or Tourette's disorder and who had approximately 1,342 patient-years of exposure to oral ABILIFY. A total of 959 pediatric patients were treated with oral ABILIFY for at least 180 days and 556 pediatric patients treated with oral ABILIFY had at least 1 year of exposure.

 The conditions and duration of treatment with ABILIFY (monotherapy and adjunctive therapy with antidepressants or mood stabilizers) included (in overlapping categories) double-blind, comparative and noncomparative open-label studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, fixed- and flexible-dose studies, and short- and longer-term exposure.

   EXCERPT:     Commonly observed adverse reactions (incidence &gt;=5% and at least twice that for placebo) were (  6.1  ):  

 *    Adult patients with schizophrenia: akathisia 
 *    Pediatric patients (13 to 17 years) with schizophrenia: extrapyramidal disorder, somnolence, and tremor 
 *    Adult patients (monotherapy) with bipolar mania: akathisia, sedation, restlessness, tremor, and extrapyramidal disorder 
 *    Adult patients (adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate) with bipolar mania: akathisia, insomnia, and extrapyramidal disorder 
 *    Pediatric patients (10 to 17 years) with bipolar mania: somnolence, extrapyramidal disorder, fatigue, nausea, akathisia, blurred vision, salivary hypersecretion, and dizziness 
 *    Adult patients with major depressive disorder (adjunctive treatment to antidepressant therapy): akathisia, restlessness, insomnia, constipation, fatigue, and blurred vision 
 *    Pediatric patients (6 to 17 years) with autistic disorder: sedation, fatigue, vomiting, somnolence, tremor, pyrexia, drooling, decreased appetite, salivary hypersecretion, extrapyramidal disorder, and lethargy 
 *    Pediatric patients (6 to 18 years) with Tourette's disorder: sedation, somnolence, nausea, headache, nasopharyngitis, fatigue, increased appetite 
 *    Adult patients with agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar mania: nausea

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

    Adult Patients with Schizophrenia  

  The following findings are based on a pool of five placebo-controlled trials (four 4-week and one 6-week) in which oral ABILIFY was administered in doses ranging from 2 to 30 mg/day.

   Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions  

 The only commonly observed adverse reaction associated with the use of ABILIFY in patients with schizophrenia (incidence of 5% or greater and ABILIFY incidence at least twice that for placebo) was akathisia (ABILIFY 8%; placebo 4%).

     Adult Patients with Bipolar Mania  

      Monotherapy    

  The following findings are based on a pool of 3-week, placebo-controlled, bipolar mania trials in which oral ABILIFY was administered at doses of 15 or 30 mg/day.

   Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions  

 Commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of ABILIFY in patients with bipolar mania (incidence of 5% or greater and ABILIFY incidence at least twice that for placebo) are shown in  Table 16  .

  a Adverse reactions reported by at least 2% of patients treated with oral ABILIFY, except adverse reactions which had an incidence equal to or less than placebo.    
         An examination of population subgroups did not reveal any clear evidence of differential adverse reaction incidence on the basis of age, gender, or race.
 

     Adult Patients with Adjunctive Therapy with Bipolar Mania  

  The following findings are based on a placebo-controlled trial of adult patients with bipolar disorder in which ABILIFY was administered at doses of 15 or 30 mg/day as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate.

   Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment  

 In a study of patients who were already tolerating either lithium or valproate as monotherapy, discontinuation rates due to adverse reactions were 12% for patients treated with adjunctive ABILIFY compared to 6% for patients treated with adjunctive placebo. The most common adverse drug reactions associated with discontinuation in the adjunctive ABILIFY-treated compared to placebo-treated patients were akathisia (5% and 1%, respectively) and tremor (2% and 1%, respectively).

   Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions  

 The commonly observed adverse reactions associated with adjunctive ABILIFY and lithium or valproate in patients with bipolar mania (incidence of 5% or greater and incidence at least twice that for adjunctive placebo) were: akathisia, insomnia, and extrapyramidal disorder.

     Less Common Adverse Reactions in Adult Patients with Adjunctive Therapy in Bipolar Mania  

    Table 18  enumerates the incidence, rounded to the nearest percent, of adverse reactions that occurred during acute treatment (up to 6 weeks), including only those reactions that occurred in 2% or more of patients treated with adjunctive ABILIFY (doses of 15 or 30 mg/day) and lithium or valproate and for which the incidence in patients treated with this combination was greater than the incidence in patients treated with placebo plus lithium or valproate.

             Adult Patients Receiving ABILIFY as Adjunctive Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder  
   The following findings are based on a pool of two placebo-controlled trials of patients with major depressive disorder in which ABILIFY was administered at doses of 2 mg to 20 mg as adjunctive treatment to continued antidepressant therapy.

   Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment  

 The incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions was 6% for adjunctive ABILIFY-treated patients and 2% for adjunctive placebo-treated patients.

   Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions  

 The commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of adjunctive ABILIFY in patients with major depressive disorder (incidence of 5% or greater and ABILIFY incidence at least twice that for placebo) were: akathisia, restlessness, insomnia, constipation, fatigue, and blurred vision.

   Less Common Adverse Reactions in Adult Patients with Major Depressive Disorder  

   Table 23  enumerates the pooled incidence, rounded to the nearest percent, of adverse reactions that occurred during acute therapy (up to 6 weeks), including only those adverse reactions that occurred in 2% or more of patients treated with adjunctive ABILIFY (doses &gt;=2 mg/day) and for which the incidence in patients treated with adjunctive ABILIFY was greater than the incidence in patients treated with adjunctive placebo in the combined dataset.

             Patients with Agitation Associated with Schizophrenia or Bipolar Mania (Intramuscular Injection)  
   The following findings are based on a pool of three placebo-controlled trials of patients with agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar mania in which ABILIFY injection was administered at doses of 5.25 mg to 15 mg.

   Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions  

 There was one commonly observed adverse reaction (nausea) associated with the use of ABILIFY injection in patients with agitation associated with schizophrenia and bipolar mania (incidence of 5% or greater and ABILIFY incidence at least twice that for placebo).

   Less Common Adverse Reactions in Patients with Agitation Associated with Schizophrenia or Bipolar Mania  

   Table 24  enumerates the pooled incidence, rounded to the nearest percent, of adverse reactions that occurred during acute therapy (24-hour), including only those adverse reactions that occurred in 2% or more of patients treated with ABILIFY injection (doses &gt;=5.25 mg/day) and for which the incidence in patients treated with ABILIFY injection was greater than the incidence in patients treated with placebo in the combined dataset.

             Dose-Related Adverse Reactions  
       Schizophrenia    

  Dose response relationships for the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events were evaluated from four trials in adult patients with schizophrenia comparing various fixed doses (2, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 mg/day) of oral ABILIFY to placebo. This analysis, stratified by study, indicated that the only adverse reaction to have a possible dose response relationship, and then most prominent only with 30 mg, was somnolence [including sedation]; (incidences were placebo, 7.1%; 10 mg, 8.5%; 15 mg, 8.7%; 20 mg, 7.5%; 30 mg, 12.6%).

 In the study of pediatric patients (13 to 17 years of age) with schizophrenia, three common adverse reactions appeared to have a possible dose response relationship: extrapyramidal disorder (incidences were placebo, 5.0%; 10 mg, 13.0%; 30 mg, 21.6%); somnolence (incidences were placebo, 6.0%; 10 mg, 11.0%; 30 mg, 21.6%); and tremor (incidences were placebo, 2.0%; 10 mg, 2.0%; 30 mg, 11.8%).

       Bipolar Mania    

  In the study of pediatric patients (10 to 17 years of age) with bipolar mania, four common adverse reactions had a possible dose response relationship at 4 weeks; extrapyramidal disorder (incidences were placebo, 3.1%; 10 mg, 12.2%; 30 mg, 27.3%); somnolence (incidences were placebo, 3.1%; 10 mg, 19.4%; 30 mg, 26.3%); akathisia (incidences were placebo, 2.1%; 10 mg, 8.2%; 30 mg, 11.1%); and salivary hypersecretion (incidences were placebo, 0%; 10 mg, 3.1%; 30 mg, 8.1%).

       Autistic Disorder    

  In a study of pediatric patients (6 to 17 years of age) with autistic disorder, one common adverse reaction had a possible dose response relationship: fatigue (incidences were placebo, 0%; 5 mg, 3.8%; 10 mg, 22.0%; 15 mg, 18.5%).

       Tourette's Disorder    

  In a study of pediatric patients (7 to 17 years of age) with Tourette's disorder, no common adverse reaction(s) had a dose response relationship.

       Extrapyramidal Symptoms    

      Schizophrenia    

  In short-term, placebo-controlled trials in schizophrenia in adults, the incidence of reported EPS-related events, excluding events related to akathisia, for ABILIFY-treated patients was 13% vs. 12% for placebo; and the incidence of akathisia-related events for ABILIFY-treated patients was 8% vs. 4% for placebo. In the short-term, placebo-controlled trial of schizophrenia in pediatric patients (13 to 17 years), the incidence of reported EPS-related events, excluding events related to akathisia, for ABILIFY-treated patients was 25% vs. 7% for placebo; and the incidence of akathisia-related events for ABILIFY-treated patients was 9% vs. 6% for placebo.

 Objectively collected data from those trials was collected on the Simpson Angus Rating Scale (for EPS), the Barnes Akathisia Scale (for akathisia), and the Assessments of Involuntary Movement Scales (for dyskinesias). In the adult schizophrenia trials, the objectively collected data did not show a difference between ABILIFY and placebo, with the exception of the Barnes Akathisia Scale (ABILIFY, 0.08; placebo, -0.05). In the pediatric (13 to 17 years) schizophrenia trial, the objectively collected data did not show a difference between ABILIFY and placebo, with the exception of the Simpson Angus Rating Scale (ABILIFY, 0.24; placebo, -0.29).

 Similarly, in a long-term (26-week), placebo-controlled trial of schizophrenia in adults, objectively collected data on the Simpson Angus Rating Scale (for EPS), the Barnes Akathisia Scale (for akathisia), and the Assessments of Involuntary Movement Scales (for dyskinesias) did not show a difference between ABILIFY and placebo.

       Bipolar Mania    

  In the short-term, placebo-controlled trials in bipolar mania in adults, the incidence of reported EPS-related events, excluding events related to akathisia, for monotherapy ABILIFY-treated patients was 16% vs. 8% for placebo and the incidence of akathisia-related events for monotherapy ABILIFY-treated patients was 13% vs. 4% for placebo. In the 6-week, placebo-controlled trial in bipolar mania for adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate, the incidence of reported EPS-related events, excluding events related to akathisia for adjunctive ABILIFY-treated patients was 15% vs. 8% for adjunctive placebo and the incidence of akathisia-related events for adjunctive ABILIFY-treated patients was 19% vs. 5% for adjunctive placebo. In the short-term, placebo-controlled trial in bipolar mania in pediatric (10 to 17 years) patients, the incidence of reported EPS-related events, excluding events related to akathisia, for ABILIFY-treated patients was 26% vs. 5% for placebo and the incidence of akathisia-related events for ABILIFY-treated patients was 10% vs. 2% for placebo.

 In the adult bipolar mania trials with monotherapy ABILIFY, the Simpson Angus Rating Scale and the Barnes Akathisia Scale showed a significant difference between ABILIFY and placebo (ABILIFY, 0.50; placebo, -0.01 and ABILIFY, 0.21; placebo, -0.05). Changes in the Assessments of Involuntary Movement Scales were similar for the ABILIFY and placebo groups. In the bipolar mania trials with ABILIFY as adjunctive therapy with either lithium or valproate, the Simpson Angus Rating Scale and the Barnes Akathisia Scale showed a significant difference between adjunctive ABILIFY and adjunctive placebo (ABILIFY, 0.73; placebo, 0.07 and ABILIFY, 0.30; placebo, 0.11). Changes in the Assessments of Involuntary Movement Scales were similar for adjunctive ABILIFY and adjunctive placebo. In the pediatric (10 to 17 years), short-term, bipolar mania trial, the Simpson Angus Rating Scale showed a significant difference between ABILIFY and placebo (ABILIFY, 0.90; placebo, -0.05). Changes in the Barnes Akathisia Scale and the Assessments of Involuntary Movement Scales were similar for the ABILIFY and placebo groups.

       Major Depressive Disorder    

  In the short-term, placebo-controlled trials in major depressive disorder, the incidence of reported EPS-related events, excluding events related to akathisia, for adjunctive ABILIFY-treated patients was 8% vs. 5% for adjunctive placebo-treated patients; and the incidence of akathisia-related events for adjunctive ABILIFY-treated patients was 25% vs. 4% for adjunctive placebo-treated patients.

 In the major depressive disorder trials, the Simpson Angus Rating Scale and the Barnes Akathisia Scale showed a significant difference between adjunctive ABILIFY and adjunctive placebo (ABILIFY, 0.31; placebo, 0.03 and ABILIFY, 0.22; placebo, 0.02). Changes in the Assessments of Involuntary Movement Scales were similar for the adjunctive ABILIFY and adjunctive placebo groups.

       Autistic Disorder    

  In the short-term, placebo-controlled trials in autistic disorder in pediatric patients (6 to 17 years), the incidence of reported EPS-related events, excluding events related to akathisia, for ABILIFY-treated patients was 18% vs. 2% for placebo and the incidence of akathisia-related events for ABILIFY-treated patients was 3% vs. 9% for placebo.

 In the pediatric (6 to 17 years) short-term autistic disorder trials, the Simpson Angus Rating Scale showed a significant difference between ABILIFY and placebo (ABILIFY, 0.1; placebo, -0.4). Changes in the Barnes Akathisia Scale and the Assessments of Involuntary Movement Scales were similar for the ABILIFY and placebo groups.

       Tourette's Disorder    

  In the short-term, placebo-controlled trials in Tourette's disorder in pediatric patients (6 to 18 years), the incidence of reported EPS-related events, excluding events related to akathisia, for ABILIFY-treated patients was 7% vs. 6% for placebo and the incidence of akathisia-related events for ABILIFY-treated patients was 4% vs. 6% for placebo.

 In the pediatric (6 to 18 years) short-term Tourette's disorder trials, changes in the Simpson Angus Rating Scale, Barnes Akathisia Scale and Assessments of Involuntary Movement Scale were not clinically meaningfully different for ABILIFY and placebo.

       Agitation Associated with Schizophrenia or Bipolar Mania    

  In the placebo-controlled trials in patients with agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar mania, the incidence of reported EPS-related events excluding events related to akathisia for ABILIFY-treated patients was 2% vs. 2% for placebo and the incidence of akathisia-related events for ABILIFY-treated patients was 2% vs. 0% for placebo. Objectively collected data on the Simpson Angus Rating Scale (for EPS) and the Barnes Akathisia Scale (for akathisia) for all treatment groups did not show a difference between ABILIFY and placebo.

       Dystonia    

  Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups.

   Additional Findings Observed in Clinical Trials  

     Adverse Reactions in Long-Term, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trials  

  The adverse reactions reported in a 26-week, double-blind trial comparing oral ABILIFY and placebo in patients with schizophrenia were generally consistent with those reported in the short-term, placebo-controlled trials, except for a higher incidence of tremor [8% (12/153) for ABILIFY vs. 2% (3/153) for placebo]. In this study, the majority of the cases of tremor were of mild intensity (8/12 mild and 4/12 moderate), occurred early in therapy (9/12 &lt;=49 days), and were of limited duration (7/12 &lt;=10 days). Tremor infrequently led to discontinuation (&lt;1%) of ABILIFY. In addition, in a long-term (52 week), active-controlled study, the incidence of tremor was 5% (40/859) for ABILIFY. A similar profile was observed in a long-term monotherapy study and a long-term adjunctive study with lithium and valproate in bipolar disorder.

   The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ABILIFY. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: occurrences of allergic reaction (anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, laryngospasm, pruritus/urticaria, or oropharyngeal spasm), pathological gambling, hiccups and blood glucose fluctuation.

   5.1 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis

    Increased Mortality  

   Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. ABILIFY (aripiprazole) is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see  BOXED WARNING  ]  .  

     Safety Experience in Elderly Patients with Psychosis Associated with Alzheimer's Disease  

  In three, 10-week, placebo-controlled studies of ABILIFY in elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease (n=938; mean age: 82.4 years; range: 56-99 years), the adverse reactions that were reported at an incidence of &gt;=3% and ABILIFY incidence at least twice that for placebo were lethargy [placebo 2%, ABILIFY 5%], somnolence (including sedation) [placebo 3%, ABILIFY 8%], and incontinence (primarily, urinary incontinence) [placebo 1%, ABILIFY 5%], excessive salivation [placebo 0%, ABILIFY 4%], and lightheadedness [placebo 1%, ABILIFY 4%].

 The safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of patients with psychosis associated with dementia have not been established. If the prescriber elects to treat such patients with ABILIFY, assess for the emergence of difficulty swallowing or excessive somnolence, which could predispose to accidental injury or aspiration [see  BOXED WARNING  ]  .

     5.2 Cerebrovascular Adverse Events, Including Stroke  

  In placebo-controlled clinical studies (two flexible dose and one fixed dose study) of dementia-related psychosis, there was an increased incidence of cerebrovascular adverse events (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities, in ABILIFY-treated patients (mean age: 84 years; range: 78-88 years). In the fixed-dose study, there was a statistically significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY. ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see  BOXED WARNING  ]  .

    5.3 Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults

  Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term, placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18-24) with MDD and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.

 The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs. placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in Table 5.

        No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.
 

 It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression.

  All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases.  

 The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for MDD as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.

 Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.

  Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to healthcare providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for ABILIFY should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.  

  Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder:  A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression.

 It should be noted that ABILIFY is not approved for use in treating depression in the pediatric population.

    5.4 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)

  A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) may occur with administration of antipsychotic drugs, including ABILIFY. Rare cases of NMS occurred during ABILIFY treatment in the worldwide clinical database. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.

 The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to exclude cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever, and primary central nervous system pathology.

 The management of NMS should include: 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy; 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring; and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS.

 If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported.

    5.5 Tardive Dyskinesia

  A syndrome of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown.

 The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses.

 There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and, thereby, may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.

 Given these considerations, ABILIFY should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that (1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.

 If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with ABILIFY despite the presence of the syndrome.

    5.6 Metabolic Changes

  Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that include hyperglycemia/diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While all drugs in the class have been shown to produce some metabolic changes, each drug has its own specific risk profile.

     Hyperglycemia/Diabetes Mellitus  

  Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. There have been reports of hyperglycemia in patients treated with ABILIFY [see  ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1  ,  6.2  )]  . Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse events is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Because ABILIFY was not marketed at the time these studies were performed, it is not known if ABILIFY is associated with this increased risk. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available.

 Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug.

     Adults  

  In an analysis of 13 placebo-controlled monotherapy trials in adults, primarily with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, the mean change in fasting glucose in ABILIFY-treated patients (+4.4 mg/dL; median exposure 25 days; N=1057) was not significantly different than in placebo-treated patients (+2.5 mg/dL; median exposure 22 days; N=799). Table 6 shows the proportion of ABILIFY-treated patients with normal and borderline fasting glucose at baseline (median exposure 25 days) that had treatment-emergent high fasting glucose measurements compared to placebo-treated patients (median exposure 22 days).

  In an analysis of two placebo-controlled trials in adolescents with schizophrenia (13 to 17 years) and pediatric patients with bipolar disorder (10 to 17 years), the mean change in fasting glucose in ABILIFY-treated patients (+4.8 mg/dL; with a median exposure of 43 days; N=259) was not significantly different than in placebo-treated patients (+1.7 mg/dL; with a median exposure of 42 days; N=123).

 In an analysis of two placebo-controlled trials in pediatric and adolescent patients with irritability associated with autistic disorder (6 to 17 years) with median exposure of 56 days, the mean change in fasting glucose in ABILIFY-treated patients (-0.2 mg/dL; N=83) was not significantly different than in placebo-treated patients (-0.6 mg/dL; N=33).

 In an analysis of two placebo-controlled trials in pediatric and adolescent patients with Tourette's disorder (6 to 18 years) with median exposure of 57 days, the mean change in fasting glucose in ABILIFY-treated patients (0.79 mg/dL; N=90) was not significantly different than in placebo-treated patients (-1.66 mg/dL; N=58).

 Table 8 shows the proportion of patients with changes in fasting glucose levels from the pooled adolescent schizophrenia and pediatric bipolar patients (median exposure of 42-43 days), from two placebo-controlled trials in pediatric patients (6 to 17 years) with irritability associated with autistic disorder (median exposure of 56 days), and from the two placebo-controlled trials in pediatric patients (6 to 18 year) with Tourette's Disorder (median exposure 57 days).

           At 12 weeks in the pooled adolescent schizophrenia and pediatric bipolar disorder trials, the mean change in fasting glucose in ABILIFY-treated patients was not significantly different than in placebo-treated patients [+2.4 mg/dL (n=81) and +0.1 mg/dL (n=15), respectively].
 

     Dyslipidemia  

  Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics.

 There were no significant differences between ABILIFY- and placebo-treated patients in the proportion with changes from normal to clinically significant levels for fasting/nonfasting total cholesterol, fasting triglycerides, fasting LDLs, and fasting/nonfasting HDLs. Analyses of patients with at least 12 or 24 weeks of exposure were limited by small numbers of patients.

     Adults  

  Table 9 shows the proportion of adult patients, primarily from pooled schizophrenia and bipolar disorder monotherapy placebo-controlled trials, with changes in total cholesterol (pooled from 17 trials; median exposure 21 to 25 days), fasting triglycerides (pooled from eight trials; median exposure 42 days), fasting LDL cholesterol (pooled from eight trials; median exposure 39 to 45 days, except for placebo-treated patients with baseline normal fasting LDL measurements, who had median treatment exposure of 24 days) and HDL cholesterol (pooled from nine trials; median exposure 40 to 42 days).

  Weight gain has been observed with atypical antipsychotic use. Clinical monitoring of weight is recommended.

     Adults  

   In an analysis of 13 placebo-controlled monotherapy trials, primarily from pooled schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, with a median exposure of 21 to 25 days, the mean change in body weight in ABILIFY-treated patients was +0.3 kg (N=1673) compared to -0.1 kg (N=1100) in placebo-controlled patients. At 24 weeks, the mean change from baseline in body weight in ABILIFY-treated patients was -1.5 kg (n=73) compared to  -0.2 kg (n=46) in placebo-treated patients.
 

 In the trials adding ABILIFY to antidepressants, patients first received 8 weeks of antidepressant treatment followed by 6 weeks of adjunctive ABILIFY or placebo in addition to their ongoing antidepressant treatment. The mean change in body weight in patients receiving adjunctive ABILIFY was +1.7 kg (N=347) compared to +0.4 kg (N=330) in patients receiving adjunctive placebo.

  In an analysis of two placebo-controlled trials in adolescents with schizophrenia (13 to 17 years) and pediatric patients with bipolar disorder (10 to 17 years) with median exposure of 42 to 43 days, the mean change in body weight in ABILIFY-treated patients was +1.6 kg (N=381) compared to +0.3 kg (N=187) in placebo-treated patients. At 24 weeks, the mean change from baseline in body weight in ABILIFY-treated patients was +5.8 kg (n=62) compared to +1.4 kg (n=13) in placebo-treated patients.

 In two short-term, placebo-controlled trials in patients (6 to 17 years) with irritability associated with autistic disorder with median exposure of 56 days, the mean change in body weight in ABILIFY-treated patients was +1.6 kg (n=209) compared to +0.4 kg (n=98) in placebo-treated patients.

 In two short-term, placebo-controlled trials in patients (6 to 18 years) with Tourette's Disorder with median exposure of 57 days, the mean change in body weight in ABILIFY-treated patients was +1.5 kg (n=105) compared to +0.4 kg (n=66) in placebo-treated patients.

                       Placebo

           In an open-label trial that enrolled patients from the two placebo-controlled trials of adolescents with schizophrenia (13 to 17 years) and pediatric patients with bipolar disorder (10 to 17 years), 73.2% of patients (238/325) completed 26 weeks of therapy with ABILIFY. After 26 weeks, 32.8% of patients gained &gt;=7% of their body weight, not adjusted for normal growth. To adjust for normal growth, z-scores were derived (measured in standard deviations [SD]), which normalize for the natural growth of pediatric patients and adolescents by comparisons to age- and gender-matched population standards. A z-score change &lt;0.5 SD is considered not clinically significant. After 26 weeks, the mean change in z-score was 0.09 SD.
 

 In an open-label trial that enrolled patients from two short-term, placebo-controlled trials, patients (6 to 17 years) with irritability associated with autistic disorder, as well as de novo  patients, 60.3% (199/330) completed one year of therapy with ABILIFY. The mean change in weight z-score was 0.26 SDs for patients receiving &gt;9 months of treatment.

 When treating pediatric patients for any indication, weight gain should be monitored and assessed against that expected for normal growth.

     5.7 Pathological Gambling and Other Compulsive Behaviors  

   Post-marketing case reports suggest that patients can experience intense urges, particularly for gambling, and the inability to control these urges while taking aripiprazole. Other compulsive urges, reported less frequently, include: sexual urges, shopping, eating or binge eating, and other impulsive or compulsive behaviors. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal, it is important for prescribers to ask patients or their caregivers specifically about the development of new or intense gambling urges, compulsive sexual urges, compulsive shopping, binge or compulsive eating, or other urges while being treated with aripiprazole. It should be noted that impulse-control symptoms can be associated with the underlying disorder. In some cases, although not all, urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Compulsive behaviors may result in harm to the patient and others if not recognized. Consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges.  

    5.8 Orthostatic Hypotension

  ABILIFY may cause orthostatic hypotension, perhaps due to its alpha1-adrenergic receptor antagonism. The incidence of orthostatic hypotension-associated events from short-term, placebo-controlled trials of adult patients on oral ABILIFY (n=2467) included (ABILIFY incidence, placebo incidence) orthostatic hypotension (1%, 0.3%), postural dizziness (0.5%, 0.3%), and syncope (0.5%, 0.4%); of pediatric patients 6 to 18 years of age (n=732) on oral ABILIFY included orthostatic hypotension (0.5%, 0%), postural dizziness (0.4%, 0%), and syncope (0.2%, 0%); and of patients on ABILIFY Injection (n=501) included orthostatic hypotension (0.6%, 0%), postural dizziness (0.2%, 0.5%), and syncope (0.4%, 0%) [see  ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)  ].  

 The incidence of a significant orthostatic change in blood pressure (defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure &gt;=20 mmHg accompanied by an increase in heart rate &gt;=25 bpm when comparing standing to supine values) for ABILIFY was not meaningfully different from placebo (ABILIFY incidence, placebo incidence): in adult oral ABILIFY-treated patients (4%, 2%), in pediatric oral ABILIFY-treated patients aged 6 to 18 years (0.4%, 1%), or in ABILIFY injection-treated patients (3%, 2%).

 ABILIFY should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, or conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications) [see  DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1)  ]  .

 If parenteral benzodiazepine therapy is deemed necessary in addition to ABILIFY injection treatment, patients should be monitored for excessive sedation and for orthostatic hypotension [see     DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1)  ]  .

     5.9 Falls  

   Antipsychotics, including ABILIFY, may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy.  

    5.10 Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis

  In clinical trials and/or postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia and neutropenia have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY. Agranulocytosis has also been reported.

 Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC)/absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia. In patients with a history of a clinically significant low WBC/ANC or drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia, perform a complete blood count (CBC) frequently during the first few months of therapy. In such patients, consider discontinuation of ABILIFY at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors.

 Monitor patients with clinically significant neutropenia for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treat promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Discontinue ABILIFY in patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count &lt;1000/mm3) and follow their WBC counts until recovery.

    5.11 Seizures/Convulsions

  In short-term, placebo-controlled trials, patients with a history of seizures excluded seizures/convulsions occurred in 0.1% (3/2467) of undiagnosed adult patients treated with oral ABILIFY, in 0.1% (1/732) of pediatric patients (6 to 18 years), and in 0.2% (1/501) of adult ABILIFY injection-treated patients.

 As with other antipsychotic drugs, ABILIFY should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that lower the seizure threshold. Conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in a population of 65 years or older.

    5.12 Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment

  ABILIFY, like other antipsychotics, may have the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills. For example, in short-term, placebo-controlled trials, somnolence (including sedation) was reported as follows (ABILIFY incidence, placebo incidence): in adult patients (n=2467) treated with oral ABILIFY (11%, 6%), in pediatric patients ages 6 to 17 (n=611) (24%, 6%), and in adult patients (n=501) on ABILIFY Injection (9%, 6%). Somnolence (including sedation) led to discontinuation in 0.3% (8/2467) of adult patients and 3% (20/732) of pediatric patients (6 to 18 years) on oral ABILIFY in short-term, placebo-controlled trials, but did not lead to discontinuation of any adult patients on ABILIFY Injection.

 Despite the relatively modest increased incidence of these events compared to placebo, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that therapy with ABILIFY does not affect them adversely.

    5.13 Body Temperature Regulation

  Disruption of the body's ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Appropriate care is advised when prescribing ABILIFY for patients who will be experiencing conditions which may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature, (e.g., exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medication with anticholinergic activity, or being subject to dehydration) [see  ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.2)  ]  .

    5.14 Suicide

  The possibility of a suicide attempt is inherent in psychotic illnesses, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder, and close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany drug therapy. Prescriptions for ABILIFY should be written for the smallest quantity consistent with good patient management in order to reduce the risk of overdose [see  ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1  ,  6.2)  ]  .

    5.15 Dysphagia

  Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use, including ABILIFY. Aspiration pneumonia is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly patients, in particular those with advanced Alzheimer's dementia. ABILIFY and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia [see  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)    and   ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.2)  ].
