  EXCERPT:   The most common reported adverse reactions (&gt;=2%) are eye irritation, posterior capsule opacification, increased intraocular pressure, and anterior chamber inflammation. (  6.1  )



   To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Omeros Corporation at 1-844-OMEROS1 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or    www.fda.gov/medwatch    .  



 

  6.1 Clinical Studies Experience

  Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



   Table 1  shows frequently reported ocular adverse reactions with an incidence of &gt;= 2% of adult patients as seen in the combined clinical trial results from three randomized, placebo-controlled studies  [see Clinical Studies (  14  )]  .

         In a safety study that enrolled 72 pediatric patients up to 3 years old, no overall difference in safety was observed between pediatric and adult patients.

  EXCERPT:   Systemic exposure to phenylephrine may cause elevations in blood pressure. (  5.1  )



 



   5.1 Elevated Blood Pressure



  Systemic exposure to phenylephrine can cause elevations in blood pressure.



    5.2 Cross-Sensitivity or Hypersensitivity



  There is the potential for cross-sensitivity to acetylsalicylic acid, phenylacetic acid derivatives, and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). There have been reports of bronchospasm or exacerbation of asthma associated with the use of ketorolac in patients who either have a known hypersensitivity to aspirin/NSAIDs or a past medical history of asthma. Therefore, use Omidria with caution in individuals who have previously exhibited sensitivities to these drugs.
