  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 CAVERJECT IMPULSE was evaluated in 87 patients in an open-label crossover study of 6 weeks treatment duration that compared the formulation of alprostadil for injection contained in CAVERJECT IMPULSE with the formulation contained in CAVERJECT Sterile Powder. Doses used in this study ranged from 2.5 mcg to 20 mcg. Adverse reactions reported for the CAVERJECT IMPULSE formulation included: penis disorder (4.6%), prolonged erection (1.1%), injection site erythema (1.1%), rash (1.1%), dizziness (1.1%), and hematospermia (1.1%). Penis disorder included penile pain, post-injection pain, and pain with erection.



 CAVERJECT IMPULSE was also evaluated in 63 patients in a single-dose, double-blind, crossover study that compared CAVERJECT IMPULSE with CAVERJECT Sterile Powder. Doses used in this study ranged from 2.5 mcg to 20 mcg. Adverse reactions reported for the CAVERJECT IMPULSE formulation included: penile pain (1.6%) and pruritus (1.6%).



 In addition to the adverse reactions observed for CAVERJECT IMPULSE in these two studies, the following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical studies of CAVERJECT Sterile Powder:



     Local Adverse Reactions:  Local adverse reactions derived from 1861 patients in clinical studies of CAVERJECT Sterile Powder, including an 18-month, open-label study, are shown in Table 1.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *   Prolonged erection and priapism have occurred in patients receiving CAVERJECT. To minimize the chances of this occurring, titrate CAVERJECT IMPULSE slowly to the lowest effective dose (  2.1  ). Advise patients to seek immediate medical assistance for an erection that persists longer than 4 hours (  5.1  ) 
 *   Penile fibrosis has occurred in patients receiving CAVERJECT. Follow patients regularly to detect signs of penile fibrosis. Discontinue in patients who develop penile angulation or cavernosal fibrosis (  5.2  ) 
 *   Hypotension - injections of CAVERJECT IMPULSE can lead to increased peripheral blood levels of alprostadil, especially in patients with significant corpora cavernosa venous leakage. Avoid use in patients with known cavernosal venous leakage (  5.3  ) 
 *   Injection site bleeding may occur in patients taking anticoagulants, such as warfarin or heparin. Compress the site of injection with an alcohol swab or sterile gauze for 5 minutes (  5.4  ) 
 *   Cardiovascular risk related to underlying medical conditions - Underlying treatable medical causes of erectile dysfunction should be diagnosed and treated prior to initiation of therapy (  5.5  ) 
 *   Risks of use in combination with other vasoactive medications injected intracavernosally - Safety and efficacy of combinations of CAVERJECT and other vasoactive agents have not been systematically studied. Use of such combinations is not recommended (  5.6  ) 
 *   Risk of needle breakage - CAVERJECT IMPULSE uses a superfine needle and cases of needle breakage have been reported. Careful instruction in proper patient handling and injection techniques may minimize this risk (  5.7  ) 
 *   Benzyl alcohol - CAVERJECT IMPULSE contains benzyl alcohol as a preservative (  5.8  ) 
 *  C ounseling patients about sexually transmitted diseases . Counseling of patients about the protective measures necessary to guard against sexually transmitted disease including the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is advised. (  5.9  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Prolonged Erection and Priapism



  Prolonged erection defined as erection lasting between 4 to 6 hours in duration occurred in 4% of 1,861 patients treated up to 18 months in studies of CAVERJECT Sterile Powder. The incidence of priapism (erections lasting more than 6 hours in duration) was 0.4%. In the event of an erection that persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency may result.



 To minimize the chances of prolonged erection or priapism, CAVERJECT IMPULSE should be titrated slowly to the lowest effective dose [  see   Dosage and Administration (2.1  ].  In addition, do not use CAVERJECT IMPULSE in patients who have conditions that predispose them to priapism, such as sickle cell anemia or sickle cell trait, multiple myeloma, or leukemia [see  Contraindications (4)  ]  .



    5.2 Penile Fibrosis



  The overall incidence of penile fibrosis, reported in clinical studies with CAVERJECT Sterile Powder was 3%. In one self-injection clinical study where duration of use was up to 18 months, the incidence of penile fibrosis was 7.8%.



 Physical examination of the penis, should be performed periodically to detect signs of penile fibrosis. Treatment with CAVERJECT IMPULSE should be discontinued in patients who develop penile angulation or cavernosal fibrosis.



    5.3 Hypotension



  Intracavernous injections of CAVERJECT IMPULSE can increase peripheral blood levels of alprostadil which can result in hypotension. Avoid use of CAVERJECT IMPULSE in patients with known cavernosal venous leakage.



    5.4 Injection Site Bleeding When Used With Anticoagulants



  Patients on anticoagulants, such as warfarin or heparin, may have increased propensity for injection site bleeding after intracavernosal injection with CAVERJECT IMPULSE. Compress the site of injection with an alcohol swab or sterile gauze for 5 minutes.



    5.5 Cardiovascular Risk Related to Underlying Medical Conditions



  There is a potential for cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including CAVERJECT IMPULSE, generally should not be used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable because of their underlying cardiovascular status. In addition, the evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a determination of potential underlying causes and the identification of appropriate treatment following a complete medical assessment.



    5.6 Risks Of Use in Combination With Other Vasoactive Medications Injected Intracavernosally



  The safety and efficacy of combinations of CAVERJECT IMPULSE and other vasoactive agents injected intracavernosally have not been established in clinical studies. The risks of prolonged erection, priapism, and hypotension may be increased.



    5.7 Needle Breakage



   CAVERJECT IMPULSE uses a superfine (29 gauge) needle for administration. As with all superfine needles, the possibility of needle breakage exists and cases of needle breakage have been reported. Needle breakage, with a portion of the needle remaining in the penis, has been reported and, in some cases, required hospitalization and surgical removal. Careful instruction in proper patient handling and injection techniques may minimize the potential for needle breakage.  



    5.8 Benzyl Alcohol



   The preservative benzyl alcohol contained in CAVERJECT IMPULSE has been associated with serious adverse events, including the "gasping syndrome", and death in pediatric patients. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known. The risk of benzyl alcohol toxicity depends on the quantity administered and the liver and kidneys' capacity to detoxify the chemical. Premature and low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop toxicity. CAVERJECT IMPULSE is not indicated for pediatric patients.  



    5.9 Counseling Patients About Sexually Transmitted Diseases



  The use of CAVERJECT IMPULSE offers no protection against sexually transmitted diseases. Counseling of patients about the protective measures necessary to guard against sexually transmitted diseases, including the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is advised.
