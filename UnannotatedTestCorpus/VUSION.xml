  EXCERPT:   



   To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact    Mylan at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX)    or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or  www.fda.gov/medwatch.    



 

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rate observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 A total of 835 infants and young children were evaluated in the clinical development program. Of 418 subjects in the VUSION group, 58 (14%) reported one or more adverse events. Of 417 subjects in the zinc oxide/white petrolatum control group, 85 (20%) reported one or more adverse events. Adverse events that occurred at a rate of &gt;= 1% for subjects who were treated with VUSION were approximately the same in type and frequency as for subjects who were treated with zinc oxide/white petrolatum ointment.



   6.2 Post-marketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of VUSION. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Gastrointestinal Disorders:   vomiting



   General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions:   burning sensation, condition aggravated, inflammation, pain



   Injury, Poisoning and Procedural Complications:   accidental exposure



   Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders:   blister, dermatitis contact, diaper dermatitis, dry skin, erythema, pruritus, rash, skin exfoliation
