  6.1       Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 In Study 1   [see Clinical Studies (  14  )],   the adverse reactions that were associated with deflazacort treatment discontinuation, in decreasing order of frequency, were weight increased, obesity, cataract, and sleep disorder.  



   Most Common Adverse Reactions in Clinical Studies  Table 1 lists the adverse reactions that occurred in &gt;= 5% of patients in the 0.9 mg/kg/day deflazacort-treated group and that occurred more frequently than in placebo patients in Study 1, which included patients with DMD between the ages of 5 and 15 years.

        *            1  At 12 weeks placebo patients were re-randomized to receive either deflazacort or an active comparator. 
    Common adverse reactions (&gt;= 5% of deflazacort-treated patients) that occurred over 52 weeks of exposure to deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg/day in Study 1 and at a higher rate than deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg/day in the 12-week placebo-controlled phase of the trial include Cushingoid appearance (60%), hirsutism (35%), weight increased (28%), erythema (28%), central obesity (25%), abdominal pain/abdominal pain upper (18% combined), pollakiuria (15%), constipation (10%), irritability (10%), abnormal behavior (9%), pyrexia (9%), back pain (7%), rash (7%), contusion (6%), nausea (6%), psychomotor hyperactivity (6%), epistaxis (6%), and skin striae (6%).
 

 Study 1 also evaluated a higher dosage of deflazacort (1.2 mg/kg/day). Compared with the 0.9 mg/kg/day dosage, deflazacort 1.2 mg/kg/day over 52 weeks was associated with a higher incidence of certain adverse reactions, including Cushingoid appearance (69%), erythema (49%), hirsutism (37%), headache (34%), weight increased (32%), constipation (15%), abdominal pain upper (14%), skin striae (11%), acne (11%), and abdominal discomfort (8%). As there was no additional benefit with the 1.2 mg/kg/day dose of deflazacort, use of EMFLAZA 1.2 mg/kg/day is not recommended for the treatment of DMD  [see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  )].  



 In an additional clinical study of two years duration with extended follow-up (Study 2), many of the same adverse reactions were observed.  In addition, musculoskeletal events associated with long-term steroid use were also observed, including muscle weakness, tendon disorder, and osteopenia.

   5.1       Alterations in Endocrine Function



  Corticosteroids, such as EMFLAZA, can cause serious and life-threatening alterations in endocrine function, especially with chronic use.  Monitor patients receiving EMFLAZA for Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and adrenal insufficiency after EMFLAZA withdrawal.  In addition, patients with hypopituitarism, primary adrenal insufficiency or congenital adrenal hyperplasia, altered thyroid function, or pheochromocytoma may be at increased risk for adverse endocrine events.



   Risk of Adrenal Insufficiency Following Corticosteroid Withdrawal    Corticosteroids produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, with the potential for the development of secondary adrenal insufficiency after withdrawal of corticosteroid treatment. Acute adrenal insufficiency can occur if corticosteroids are withdrawn abruptly, and can be fatal.  The degree and duration of adrenocortical insufficiency produced is variable among patients and depends on the dose, frequency, and duration of corticosteroid therapy.  The risk is reduced by gradually tapering the corticosteroid dose when withdrawing treatment.  This insufficiency may persist, however, for months after discontinuation of prolonged therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period of discontinuation, corticosteroid therapy should be reinstituted.  For patients already taking corticosteroids during times of stress, the dosage may need to be increased.
 

 A steroid "withdrawal syndrome", seemingly unrelated to adrenocortical insufficiency, may also occur following abrupt discontinuance of corticosteroids.  This syndrome includes symptoms such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, headache, fever, joint pain, desquamation, myalgia, and/or weight loss.  These effects are thought to be due to the sudden change in corticosteroid concentration rather than to low corticosteroid levels.



   Cushing's Syndrome    Cushing's syndrome (hypercortisolism) occurs with prolonged exposure to exogenous corticosteroids, including EMFLAZA.  Symptoms include hypertension, truncal obesity and thinning of the limbs, purple striae, facial rounding, facial plethora, muscle weakness, easy and frequent bruising with thin fragile skin, posterior neck fat deposition, osteopenia, acne, amenorrhea, hirsutism and psychiatric abnormalities.
 

   Hyperglycemia    Corticosteroids can increase blood glucose, worsen pre-existing diabetes, predispose those on long-term therapy to diabetes mellitus, and may reduce the effect of anti-diabetic drugs. Monitor blood glucose at regular intervals. For patients with hyperglycemia, anti-diabetic treatment should be initiated or adjusted accordingly.
 

   Considerations for Use in Patients with Altered Thyroid Function    Metabolic clearance of corticosteroids is decreased in hypothyroid patients and increased in hyperthyroid patients.  Changes in thyroid status of the patient may necessitate a dose adjustment of the corticosteroid.  When concomitant administration of corticosteroids and levothyroxine is required, administration of corticosteroid should precede the initiation of levothyroxine therapy to reduce the risk of adrenal crisis.
 

   Pheochromocytoma Crisis    There have been reports of pheochromocytoma crisis, which can be fatal, after administration of systemic corticosteroids.  In patients with suspected or identified pheochromocytoma, consider the risk of pheochromocytoma crisis prior to administering corticosteroids.
 

    5.2       Immunosuppression and Increased Risk of Infection



  Corticosteroids, including EMFLAZA, suppress the immune system and increase the risk of infection with any pathogen, including viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or helminthic.  Corticosteroids reduce resistance to new infections, exacerbate existing infections, increase the risk of disseminated infections, increase the risk of reactivation or exacerbation of latent infections, and mask some signs of infection.  These infections can be severe, and at times fatal. The degree to which the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration correlates with the specific risks of infection is not well characterized; however, the rate of occurrence of infectious complications increases with increasing doses of corticosteroids.  



 Monitor for the development of infection and consider withdrawal of corticosteroids or reduction of the dose of corticosteroids as needed.



   Varicella Zoster and Measles Viral Infections    Chickenpox caused by Varicella Zoster virus and measles can have a serious or even fatal course in non-immune children or adults on corticosteroids, including EMFLAZA. In children or adults who have not had these diseases, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure.  If a patient is exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated.  If a patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated.  If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.
 

   Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation    Hepatitis B virus reactivation can occur in patients who are hepatitis B carriers undergoing treatment with immunosuppressive drugs including corticosteroids.  Reactivation can also occur in patients who appear to have resolved hepatitis B infection. 
 

   Fungal Infections    Corticosteroids may exacerbate systemic fungal infections and therefore should not be used in the presence of such infections.  For patients on corticosteroids who develop systemic fungal infections, withdrawal of corticosteroids or reduction of the dose of corticosteroids is recommended.
 

   Amebiasis    Corticosteroids may activate latent amebiasis.  Therefore, it is recommended that latent amebiasis or active amebiasis be ruled out before initiating corticosteroid therapy in any patient who has spent time in the tropics, or any patient with unexplained diarrhea.
 

   Strongyloides Infestation    In patients with known or suspected Strongyloides (threadworm) infestation, corticosteroid-induced immunosuppression may lead to Strongyloides hyperinfection and dissemination with widespread larval migration, often accompanied by severe enterocolitis and potentially fatal gram-negative septicemia.  For patients on corticosteroids who develop known or suspected Strongyloides (threadworm) infestation, withdrawal of corticosteroids or reduction of the dose of corticosteroids is recommended.
 

    5.3       Alterations in Cardiovascular/Renal Function



  Corticosteroids, including EMFLAZA, can cause elevation of blood pressure, salt, and water retention, and increased excretion of potassium and calcium.  Monitor blood pressure and assess for signs and symptoms of volume overload. Monitor serum potassium levels. Dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary.  EMFLAZA should be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure, hypertension, or renal insufficiency.



 Literature reports suggest an association between use of corticosteroids and left ventricular free wall rupture after a recent myocardial infarction; therefore, therapy with EMFLAZA should be used with great caution in these patients.



    5.4       Gastrointestinal Perforation



  There is an increased risk of gastrointestinal perforation during corticosteroid use in patients with certain gastrointestinal disorders such as active or latent peptic ulcers, diverticulitis, fresh intestinal anastomoses, and non-specific ulcerative colitis. Signs of gastrointestinal perforation, such as peritoneal irritation, may be masked in patients receiving corticosteroids.



 Avoid corticosteroids if there is a probability of impending perforation, abscess, or other pyogenic infections; diverticulitis; fresh intestinal anastomoses; or active or latent peptic ulcer.



    5.5       Behavioral and Mood Disturbances



  Potentially severe psychiatric adverse reactions may occur with systemic corticosteroids, including EMFLAZA .    Symptoms typically emerge within a few days or weeks of starting treatment and may be dose-related.  These reactions may improve after either dose reduction or withdrawal, although pharmacologic treatment may be necessary.  Psychiatric adverse reactions usually involve hypomanic or manic symptoms (e.g., euphoria, insomnia, mood swings) during treatment and depressive episodes after discontinuation of treatment. Inform patients or caregivers of the potential for behavioral and mood changes and encourage them to seek medical attention if psychiatric symptoms develop, especially if depressed mood or suicidal ideation is suspected. 



    5.6       Effects on Bones



    Decreased Bone Mineral Density    Corticosteroids, including EMFLAZA, decrease bone formation and increase bone resorption both through their effect on calcium regulation (i.e., decreasing absorption and increasing excretion) and inhibition of osteoblast function.  This, together with a decrease in the protein matrix of the bone secondary to an increase in protein catabolism and reduced sex hormone production, may lead to inhibition of bone growth in pediatric patients and the development of bone loss at any age.  Bone loss can predispose patients to vertebral and long bone fractures. Consider a patient's risk of osteoporosis before initiating corticosteroid therapy.  Monitor bone mineral density in patients on long-term treatment with EMFLAZA.
 

   Avascular Necrosis    Corticosteroids, including EMFLAZA, may cause avascular necrosis.
 

    5.7       Ophthalmic Effects



  Use of corticosteroids, including EMFLAZA, may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts. Corticosteroids may also cause glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves, and may increase the risk of secondary ocular infections caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses. Corticosteroids are not recommended for patients with active ocular herpes simplex.



 Intraocular pressure may become elevated in some patients taking corticosteroids.  If treatment with EMFLAZA is continued for more than 6 weeks, monitor intraocular pressure.



    5.8       Vaccination



  Administration of live or live attenuated vaccines is not recommended in patients receiving immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids, including EMFLAZA. Corticosteroids may also potentiate the replication of some organisms contained in live attenuated vaccines.  



 Killed or inactivated vaccines may be administered during corticosteroid therapy; however, the response to such vaccines cannot be predicted.



 Patients on corticosteroid therapy, including EMFLAZA, may exhibit a diminished response to toxoids and live or inactivated vaccines because of inhibition of antibody response.



    5.9        Serious Skin Rashes



  Toxic epidermal necrolysis has been reported with the use of deflazacort with symptoms beginning within 8 weeks of starting treatment. Discontinue at the first sign of rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug related.



    5.10       Effects on Growth and Development



  Long-term use of corticosteroids, including EMFLAZA, can have negative effects on growth and development in children.



    5.11       Myopathy



  Patients receiving corticosteroids, including EMFLAZA, and concomitant therapy with neuromuscular blocking agents (e.g., pancuronium) or patients with disorders of neuromuscular transmission (e.g., myasthenia gravis) may be at increased risk of developing acute myopathy.  This acute myopathy is generalized, may involve ocular and respiratory muscles, and may result in quadriparesis.  Elevation of creatine kinase may occur.  Clinical improvement or recovery after stopping corticosteroids may require weeks to years.



    5.12       Kaposi's Sarcoma



  Kaposi's sarcoma has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, most often for chronic conditions.  Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical improvement.



    5.13       Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants because of Benzyl Alcohol Preservative



  EMFLAZA Oral Suspension contains benzyl alcohol and is not approved for use in pediatric patients less than 5 years of age.  Serious and fatal adverse reactions including "gasping syndrome" can occur in neonates and low birth weight infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs.  The "gasping syndrome" is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations.  The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which serious adverse reactions may occur is not known (EMFLAZA Oral Suspension contains 10.45 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL; EMFLAZA Tablets do not contain benzyl alcohol) [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.4  )]  .



    5.14       Thromboembolic Events



  Observational studies have shown an increased risk of thromboembolism (including venous thromboembolism) particularly with higher cumulative doses of corticosteroids.  It is unclear if risk differs by daily dose or duration of use.  Use EMFLAZA with caution in patients who have or may be predisposed to thromboembolic disorders. 



    5.15       Anaphylaxis



  Rare instances of anaphylaxis have occurred in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, including EMFLAZA.
