  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 Serious adverse reactions that may be associated with OXAYDO include: respiratory depression, respiratory arrest, circulatory depression, cardiac arrest, hypotension, and/or shock  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5  ) and Overdosage (  10  )]  .



 The common adverse reactions seen on initiation of therapy with OXAYDO are dose-dependent, and their frequency depends on the clinical setting, the patient's level of opioid tolerance, and host factors specific to the individual. They should be expected and managed as a part of opioid therapy. The most frequent of the adverse reactions include nausea, constipation, vomiting, headache, and pruritus.



 The frequency of adverse reactions during initiation of opioid therapy may be minimized by careful individualization of starting dosage, slow titration and the avoidance of large rapid swings in plasma concentration of the opioid. Many of these adverse reactions will abate as therapy is continued and some degree of tolerance is developed, but others may be expected to remain throughout therapy.



 In all patients for whom dosing information was available (n=191) from open-label and double-blind studies involving oxycodone, the following adverse reactions were recorded in oxycodone-treated patients with an incidence of &gt;=3%. In descending order of frequency they were: nausea, constipation, vomiting, headache, pruritus, insomnia, dizziness, asthenia, and somnolence.



 The following adverse reactions occurred in less than 3% of patients involved in clinical trials with oxycodone:



   Body as a Whole:  abdominal pain, accidental injury, allergic reaction, back pain, chills and fever, fever, flu syndrome, infection, neck pain, pain, photosensitivity reaction, and sepsis.



   Cardiovascular:  deep vein thrombophlebitis, heart failure, hemorrhage, hypotension, migraine, palpitation, and tachycardia.



   Digestive:  anorexia, diarrhea, dyspepsia, dysphagia, gingivitis, glossitis, and nausea and vomiting.



   Hematopoietic and Lymphatic:  anemia and leukopenia.



   Metabolism and Nutrition:  edema, gout, hyperglycemia, iron deficiency anemia, and peripheral edema.



   Musculoskeletal:  arthralgia, arthritis, bone pain, myalgia, and pathological fracture.



   Nervous System:  agitation, anxiety, confusion, dry mouth, hypertonia, hypesthesia, nervousness, neuralgia, personality disorder, tremor, and vasodilation.



   Respiratory:  bronchitis, cough increased, dyspnea, epistaxis, laryngismus, lung disorder, pharyngitis, rhinitis, and sinusitis.



   Skin and Appendages:  herpes simplex, rash, sweating, and urticaria.



   Special Senses:  amblyopia.



   Urogenital:  urinary tract infection.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of oxycodone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These events include:



   Serotonin syndrome  : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs.



   Adrenal insufficiency  : Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use.



   Anaphylaxis  : Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in OXAYDO.



   Androgen deficiency  : Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with chronic use of opioids  [see Clinical Pharmacology (  12.2  )]  .

    Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse  



   OXAYDO exposes patients and other users to the risks of opioid addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess each patient's risk prior to prescribing OXAYDO, and monitor all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors and conditions   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )]  .  



   Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS):  



   To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a REMS for these products   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )]  . Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers.  Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to  



 *  complete a REMS-compliant education program, 
 *  counsel patients and/or their caregivers, with every prescription, on safe use, serious risks, storage, and disposal of these products, 
 *  emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide every time it is provided by their pharmacist, and 
 *  consider other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety. 
      Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression  
 

   Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of OXAYDO. Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of OXAYDO or following a dose increase   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  )]  .   



   Accidental Ingestion  



   Accidental ingestion of even one dose of OXAYDO, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of oxycodone   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  )]  .   



   Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome   



   Prolonged use of OXAYDO during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.4  )]  .   



   Cytochrome P450 3A4 Interaction   



   The concomitant use of OXAYDO with all cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may result in an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse reactions and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. In addition, discontinuation of a concomitantly used cytochrome P450 3A4 inducer may result in an increase in oxycodone plasma concentration. Monitor patients receiving OXAYDO and any CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.5  ), Drug Interactions (  7  ), Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )]  .  



   Risks From Concomitant Use With Benzodiazepines Or Other CNS Depressants  



   Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.6  ), Drug Interactions (  7  )]  .  



 *  Reserve concomitant prescribing of OXAYDO and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. 
 *  Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. 
 *  Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *   Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients : Monitor closely, particularly during initiation and titration. (  5.7  ) 
 *   Adrenal Insufficiency : If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient off of the opioid. (  5.8  ) 
 *   Severe Hypotension : Monitor during dosage initiation and titration. Avoid use of OXAYDO in patients with circulatory shock. (  5.9  ) 
 *   Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness : Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of OXAYDO in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. (  5.10  ) 
    
 

    5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse  



   OXAYDO contains oxycodone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, OXAYDO exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (  9  )].    



  Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed OXAYDO. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused.  



  Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing OXAYDO, and monitor all patients receiving OXAYDO for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as OXAYDO, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of OXAYDO along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse.  



  Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing OXAYDO. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see Patient Counseling Information (  17  )]  . Contact the local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.  



     5.2 Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)  



   To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to do all of the following:  



 *   Complete a REMS-compliant education program offered by an accredited provider of continuing education (CE) or another education program that includes all the elements of the FDA Education Blueprint for Health Care Providers Involved in the Management or Support of Patients with Pain.  
 *   Discuss the safe use, serious risks, and proper storage and disposal of opioid analgesics with patients and/or their caregivers every time these medicines are prescribed. The Patient Counseling Guide (PCG) can be obtained at this link:   www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSPCG  . 
 *   Emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide that they will receive from their pharmacist every time an opioid analgesic is dispensed to them.  
 *   Consider using other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety, such as patient- prescriber agreements that reinforce patient-prescriber responsibilities.  
    To obtain further information on the opioid analgesic REMS and for a list of accredited REMS CME/CE, call 1-800-503-0784, or log on to  www.opioidanalgesicrems.com  . The FDA Blueprint can be found at  www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSBlueprint  .
 

     5.3 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression  



   Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see Overdosage (  10  )]  . Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.  



  While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of OXAYDO, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24-72 hours of initiating therapy with and following dosage increases of OXAYDO.  



  To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of OXAYDO are essential [see Dosage and Administration (  2  )]  . Overestimating the OXAYDO dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose.  



  Accidental ingestion of even one dose of OXAYDO, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of oxycodone.  



     5.4 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome  



   Prolonged use of OXAYDO during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  ), Patient Counseling Information (  17  )]  .  



     5.5 Risks of Concomitant Use or Discontinuation of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers  



   Concomitant use of OXAYDO with a CYP3A4 inhibitor, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may increase plasma concentrations of oxycodone and prolong opioid adverse reactions, which may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  )]  , particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of OXAYDO is achieved. Similarly, discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inducer, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, in OXAYDO-treated patients may increase oxycodone plasma concentrations and prolong opioid adverse reactions. When using OXAYDO with CYP3A4 inhibitors or discontinuing CYP3A4 inducers in OXAYDO-treated patients, monitor patients closely at frequent intervals and consider dosage reduction of OXAYDO until stable drug effects are achieved [see Drug Interactions (  7  )].    



  Concomitant use of OXAYDO with CYP3A4 inducers or discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inhibitor could decrease oxycodone plasma concentrations, decrease opioid efficacy or, possibly, lead to a withdrawal syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. When using OXAYDO with CYP3A4 inducers or discontinuing CYP3A4 inhibitors, monitor patients closely at frequent intervals and consider increasing the opioid dosage if needed to maintain adequate analgesia or if symptoms of opioid withdrawal occur [see Drug Interactions (  7  )]  .  



     5.6 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants  



   Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of OXAYDO with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.  



  Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions (  7  )]  .  



  If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.  



  Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when OXAYDO is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [see Drug Interactions (  7  ) and Patient Counseling Information (  17  )]  .  



     5.7 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients  



   The use of OXAYDO in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated.  



   Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease:  OXAYDO-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of OXAYDO [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  )]  .  



   Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients:  Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  )]  .  



  Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating OXAYDO and when OXAYDO is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  )]  . Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients.  



     5.8 Adrenal Insufficiency  



   Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.  



     5.9 Severe Hypotension  



   OXAYDO may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (  7  )]  . Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of OXAYDO. In patients with circulatory shock, OXAYDO may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of OXAYDO in patients with circulatory shock.  



     5.10 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness  



   In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), OXAYDO may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with OXAYDO.  



  Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of OXAYDO in patients with impaired consciousness or coma.  



     5.11 Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions  



   OXAYDO is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus.  



  The oxycodone in OXAYDO may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms.  



     5.12 Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders  



   The oxycodone in OXAYDO may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during OXAYDO therapy.  



     5.13 Withdrawal  



   Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g, pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including OXAYDO. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms [see Drug Interactions (  7  )]  .  



  When discontinuing OXAYDO in a physically-dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (  2.4  )]  . Do not abruptly discontinue OXAYDO in these patients [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (  9.3  )]  .  



     5.14 Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery  



   OXAYDO may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of OXAYDO and know how they will react to the medication [see Patient Counseling Information (  17  )]  .
