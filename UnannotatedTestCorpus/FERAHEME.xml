  6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 In clinical studies, 3,968 subjects were exposed to Feraheme. Of these subjects 31% were male and the median age was 54 years (range of 18 to 96 years).



 The data described below reflect exposure to Feraheme in 997 patients exposed to a 1.02 g course of ferumoxytol administered as two 510 mg intravenous (IV) doses: 992 subjects (99.5%) received at least 1 complete dose of ferumoxytol and 946 subjects (94.9%) received 2 complete doses. The mean cumulative IV Iron exposure was 993.80 +/-119.085 mg.



 The safety of Feraheme was studied in a randomized, multicenter, double-blind clinical trial in patients with IDA (IDA Trial 3), [  see Clinical Studies (  14.1  )  ]. In this trial, patients were randomized to two intravenous infusions of 510 mg (1.02 g) of Feraheme (n=997), or two intravenous infusions of 750 mg (1.500 g) of ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) (n=1000). Both intravenous irons were infused over a period of at least 15 minutes. Most patients received their second infusion of Feraheme and FCM 7(+1) days after Dose 1.



 The mean (SD) age of the study population (N=1997) was 55.2 (17.16) years. The majority of patients were female (76.1%), white (71.4%) and non-Hispanic (81.8%). The mean (SD) hemoglobin at baseline for all patients was 10.4 (1.5) g/dl.



 Serious adverse events were reported in 3.6% (71/1997) of ferumoxytol- and FCM- treated patients. The most common (&gt;=2 subjects) serious AEs reported in Feraheme-treated patients were syncope, gastroenteritis, seizure, pneumonia, hemorrhagic anemia, and acute kidney injury. In FCM-treated patients the most common (&gt;=2 subjects) serious AEs were syncope, cardiac failure congestive, angina pectoris, and atrial fibrillation.



 Adverse reactions related to Feraheme and reported by &gt;=1% of Feraheme-treated patients in IDA Trial 3 are listed in  Table 1  .

         In IDA Trial 3, adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation and occurring in &gt;= 2 Feraheme-treated patients included arthralgia (0.3%), dyspnea (0.3%), flushing (0.2%), chest discomfort (0.2%), chest pain (0.2%), nausea (0.2%), back pain (0.2%), dizziness (0.2%) and headache (0.2%).
 

 Across two clinical trials in patients with IDA (IDA Trial 1 and 2), [  see Clinical Studies (  14.1  )  ], patients were randomized to: two injections (rapid intravenous injection - prior method of administration no longer approved) of 510 mg of Feraheme (n=1,014), placebo (n=200), or five injections/infusions of 200 mg of iron sucrose (n=199). Most patients received their second Feraheme injection 3 to 8 days after the first injection. Adverse reactions related to Feraheme and reported by &gt;= 1% of Feraheme-treated patients in these trials were similar to those seen in Trial 3.



 In Trials 1 and 2, adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation and occurring in &gt;= 2 Feraheme-treated patients included hypersensitivity (0.6%), hypotension (0.3%), and rash (0.2%).



 In addition, a total of 634 subjects enrolled in and completed participation in a Phase 3 open label extension study. Of these, 337 subjects met IDA treatment criteria and received Feraheme. Adverse reactions following this repeat Feraheme dosing were generally similar in type and frequency to those observed after the first two intravenous injections.



 Across three randomized clinical trials in patients with IDA and CKD (CKD Trials 1, 2, and 3), [  see Clinical Studies (  14.2  )  ], a total of 605 patients were exposed to two injections of 510 mg of Feraheme and a total of 280 patients were exposed to 200 mg/day of oral iron for 21 days. Most patients received their second Feraheme injection 3 to 8 days after the first injection.



 Adverse reactions related to Feraheme and reported by &gt;= 1% of Feraheme-treated patients in the CKD randomized clinical trials are listed in  Table 2  . Diarrhea (4%), constipation (2.1%) and hypertension (1%) have also been reported in Feraheme-treated patients.

         In these clinical trials in patients with IDA and CKD, adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation and occurring in &gt;= 2 Feraheme-treated patients included hypotension (0.4%), chest pain (0.3%), and dizziness (0.3%).
 

 Following completion of the controlled phase of the trials, 69 patients received two additional 510 mg intravenous injections of Feraheme (for a total cumulative dose of 2.04 g). Adverse reactions following this repeat Feraheme dosing were similar in character and frequency to those observed following the first two intravenous injections.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  Because adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 The following serious adverse reactions have been reported from the post-marketing experience with Feraheme: fatal, life-threatening, and serious anaphylactic-type reactions, cardiac/cardiorespiratory arrest, clinically significant hypotension, syncope, unresponsiveness, loss of consciousness, tachycardia/rhythm abnormalities, angioedema, ischemic myocardial events, congestive heart failure, pulse absent, and cyanosis. These adverse reactions have usually occurred within 30 minutes after the administration of Feraheme. Reactions have occurred following the first dose or subsequent doses of Feraheme.

   5.1 Serious Hypersensitivity Reactions



  Fatal and serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, presenting with cardiac/ cardiorespiratory arrest, clinically significant hypotension, syncope, or unresponsiveness have occurred in patients receiving Feraheme. Other adverse reactions potentially associated with hypersensitivity have occurred (pruritus, rash, urticaria, and wheezing). These reactions have occurred following the first dose or subsequent doses in patients in whom a previous Feraheme dose was tolerated.



 Patients with a history of multiple drug allergies may have a greater risk of anaphylaxis with parenteral iron products. Carefully consider the potential risks and benefits before administering Feraheme to these patients.



 Only administer Feraheme as an intravenous infusion over at least 15 minutes and only when personnel and therapies are immediately available for the treatment of anaphylaxis and other hypersensitivity reactions. Closely observe patients for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity including monitoring of blood pressure and pulse during and after Feraheme administration for at least 30 minutes and until clinically stable following completion of each infusion [   see Adverse Reactions (6.2)    ].



  In a clinical study in patients with IDA, regardless of etiology, hypersensitivity reactions were reported in 0.4% (4/997) of subjects receiving Feraheme administered as intravenous infusion over at least 15 minutes. These included one patient with severe hypersensitivity reaction and three patients with moderate hypersensitivity reactions.  



 In clinical studies predominantly in patients with IDA and CKD, serious hypersensitivity reactions were reported in 0.2% (4/1,806) of subjects receiving Feraheme (administered as a rapid intravenous injection - prior method of administration no longer approved). Other adverse reactions potentially associated with hypersensitivity (e.g., pruritus, rash, urticaria or wheezing) were reported in 3.5% (63/1,806) of these subjects.



 In the post-marketing experience, fatal and serious anaphylactic type reactions presenting with cardiac/ cardiorespiratory arrest, clinically significant hypotension, syncope, and unresponsiveness have been reported. Elderly patients with multiple or serious co-morbidities who experience hypersensitivity reactions and/or hypotension following administration of Feraheme may have more severe outcomes [   see Boxed Warning  ,  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  and  Use in Specific Populations (8.5)    ].



    5.2 Hypotension



  Feraheme may cause clinically significant hypotension.



 In a clinical study with Feraheme in patients with IDA, regardless of etiology, moderate hypotension was reported in 0.2% (2/997) of subjects receiving Feraheme administered as intravenous infusion over at least 15 minutes.



 In clinical studies in patients with IDA and CKD, hypotension was reported in 1.9% (35/1,806) of subjects, including three patients with serious hypotensive reactions, who had received Feraheme as a rapid intravenous injection (prior method of administration no longer approved).



 Hypotension has also been reported in the post-marketing experience [ see Adverse Reactions (  6.2  )  ]. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypotension following each Feraheme administration [ see Dosage and Administration (  2  ) and Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )  ].



    5.3 Iron Overload



  Excessive therapy with parenteral iron can lead to excess storage of iron with the possibility of iatrogenic hemosiderosis. Regularly monitor the hematologic response during parenteral iron therapy [   see Dosage and Administration (2)    ]. Do not administer Feraheme to patients with iron overload.



 In the 24 hours following administration of Feraheme, laboratory assays may overestimate serum iron and transferrin bound iron by also measuring the iron in the Feraheme complex.



    5.4 Magnetic Resonance (MR) Imaging Test Interference



  Administration of Feraheme may transiently affect the diagnostic ability of MR imaging. Conduct anticipated MR imaging studies prior to the administration of Feraheme. Alteration of MR imaging studies may persist for up to 3 months following the last Feraheme dose. If MR imaging is required within 3 months after Feraheme administration, use T1- or proton density-weighted MR pulse sequences to minimize the Feraheme effects; MR imaging using T2-weighted pulse sequences should not be performed earlier than 4 weeks after the administration of Feraheme. Maximum alteration of vascular MR imaging is anticipated to be evident for 1 - 2 days following Feraheme administration [ see Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )  ].



 Feraheme will not interfere with X-ray, computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), ultrasound or nuclear medicine imaging.
