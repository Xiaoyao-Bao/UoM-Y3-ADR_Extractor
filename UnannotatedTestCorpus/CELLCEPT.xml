  The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label:



 *  Embryofetal Toxicity [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  
 *  Lymphomas and Other Malignancies [see  Warnings and Precautions 5.2)  ]  
 *  Serious Infections [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  
 *  Blood Dyscrasias: Neutropenia, Pure Red Cell Aplasia [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.4)  ]  
 *  Gastrointestinal Complications [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.5)  ]  
      EXCERPT:   The most common adverse reactions in clinical trials (20 % or greater) include diarrhea, leukopenia, infection, vomiting, and there is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of infections e.g., opportunistic infection. (  6.1  )

  6.1 Clinical Studies Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The data described below primarily derive from five randomized, active-controlled double-blind 12-month trials of CELLCEPT in  de novo  kidney (3) heart (1) and liver (1) transplant patients  [see  Clinical Studies (14.1  ,  14.2  and  14.3)  ]  .



     CELLCEPT Oral  



 The incidence of adverse reactions for CELLCEPT was determined in five randomized, comparative, double-blind trials in the prevention of rejection in kidney, heart and liver transplant patients (two active- and one placebo-controlled trials, one active-controlled trial, and one active-controlled trial, respectively)  [see  Clinical Studies (14.1  ,  14.2  and  14.3)  ]  .



 The three  de novo  kidney studies with 12-month duration compared two dose levels of oral CELLCEPT (1 g twice daily and 1.5 g twice daily) with azathioprine (2 studies) or placebo (1 study) when administered in combination with cyclosporine (Sandimmune  (r)  ) and corticosteroids to prevent acute rejection episodes. One study also included anti-thymocyte globulin (ATGAM  (r))  induction therapy.



 In the  de novo  heart transplantation study with 12-month duration, patients received CELLCEPT 1.5 g twice daily (n=289) or azathioprine 1.5 to 3 mg/kg/day (n=289), in combination with cyclosporine (Sandimmune  (r)  or Neoral  (r)  ) and corticosteroids as maintenance immunosuppressive therapy.



 In the  de novo  liver transplantation study with 12-month duration, patients received CELLCEPT 1 g twice daily intravenously for up to 14 days followed by CELLCEPT 1.5 g twice daily orally or azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day intravenously followed by azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day orally, in combination with cyclosporine (Neoral  (r)  ) and corticosteroids as maintenance immunosuppressive therapy. The total number of patients enrolled was 565.



 Approximately 53% of the kidney transplant patients, 65% of the heart transplant patients, and 48% of the liver transplant patients were treated for more than 1 year. Adverse reactions reported in &gt;= 20% of patients in the CELLCEPT treatment groups are presented below. The safety data of three kidney transplantation studies are pooled together.

              In the three  de novo  kidney studies, patients receiving 2 g/day of CELLCEPT had an overall better safety profile than did patients receiving 3 g/day of CELLCEPT.
 

 Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) developed in 0.4% to 1% of patients receiving CELLCEPT (2 g or 3 g daily) with other immunosuppressive agents in controlled clinical trials of kidney, heart and liver transplant patients followed for at least 1 year  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ].  Non-melanoma skin carcinomas occurred in 1.6% to 4.2% of patients, other types of malignancy in 0.7% to 2.1% of patients. Three-year safety data in kidney and heart transplant patients did not reveal any unexpected changes in incidence of malignancy compared to the 1-year data. In pediatric patients, PTLD was observed in 1.35% (2/148) by 12 months post-transplant.



 Severe neutropenia (ANC &lt;0.5 * 10  3  /uL) developed in up to 2.0% of kidney transplant patients, up to 2.8% of heart transplant patients and up to 3.6% of liver transplant patients receiving CELLCEPT 3 g daily  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.4)  and  Dosage and Administration (2.5)  ].  



     Table 4    shows the incidence of opportunistic infections that occurred in the kidney, heart, and liver transplant populations in the azathioprine-controlled prevention trials:

              The following other opportunistic infections occurred with an incidence of less than 4% in CELLCEPT patients in the above azathioprine-controlled studies: Herpes zoster visceral disease; Candida urinary tract infection, fungemia/disseminated disease and tissue invasive disease; Cryptococcosis; Aspergillus/Mucor;  Pneumocystis jirovecii  .
 

 In patients receiving CELLCEPT (2 g or 3 g) in controlled studies for prevention of kidney, heart or liver rejection, fatal infection/sepsis occurred in approximately 2% of kidney and heart patients and in 5% of liver patients  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ].  



 The following adverse reactions were reported with 3% to &lt;20% incidence in kidney, heart, and liver transplant patients treated with CELLCEPT, in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids.

            Pediatric Study  
 

 The type and frequency of adverse events in a clinical study for prevention of kidney allograft rejection in 100 pediatric patients 3 months to 18 years of age dosed with CELLCEPT oral suspension 600 mg/m  2  twice daily (up to 1 g twice daily) were generally similar to those observed in adult patients dosed with CELLCEPT capsules at a dose of 1 g twice daily with the exception of abdominal pain, fever, infection, pain, sepsis, diarrhea, vomiting, pharyngitis, respiratory tract infection, hypertension, leukopenia, and anemia, which were observed in a higher proportion in pediatric patients.



     Geriatrics  



 Elderly patients (&gt;=65 years), particularly those who are receiving CELLCEPT as part of a combination immunosuppressive regimen, may be at increased risk of certain infections (including cytomegalovirus [CMV] tissue invasive disease) and possibly gastrointestinal hemorrhage and pulmonary edema, compared to younger individuals  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  



     CELLCEPT Intravenous  



 The safety profile of CELLCEPT Intravenous was determined from a single, double-blind, controlled comparative study of the safety of 2 g/day of intravenous and oral CELLCEPT in kidney transplant patients in the immediate post-transplant period (administered for the first 5 days). The potential venous irritation of CELLCEPT Intravenous was evaluated by comparing the adverse reactions attributable to peripheral venous infusion of CELLCEPT Intravenous with those observed in the intravenous placebo group; patients in the placebo group received active medication by the oral route.



 Adverse reactions attributable to peripheral venous infusion were phlebitis and thrombosis, both observed at 4% in patients treated with CELLCEPT Intravenous.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of CELLCEPT. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure:



 *  *  -  Facial malformations: cleft lip, cleft palate, micrognathia, hypertelorism of the orbits 
 *  -  Abnormalities of the ear and eye: abnormally formed or absent external/middle ear, coloboma, microphthalmos 
 *  -  Malformations of the fingers: polydactyly, syndactyly, brachydactyly 
 *  -  Cardiac abnormalities: atrial and ventricular septal defects 
 *  -  Esophageal malformations: esophageal atresia 
 *  -  Nervous system malformations: such as spina bifida .  
    Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Congenital malformations, and spontaneous abortions, mainly in the first trimester, have been reported following exposure to mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in combination with other immunosuppressants during pregnancy [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  , and  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ,  (8.3)  ]. Congenital malformations include: 
 *   Digestive : colitis, pancreatitis, isolated cases of intestinal villous atrophy. 
 *   Hematologic and Lymphatic : Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) and hypogammaglobulinemia have been reported in patients treated with CELLCEPT in combination with other immunosuppressive agents [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.4)  ] . 
 *   Infections : Meningitis , infectious endocarditis, tuberculosis, atypical mycobacterial infection, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, BK virus infection, viral reactivation of hepatitis B and hepatitis C [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ] . 
 *   Respiratory : Interstitial lung disorders, fatal pulmonary fibrosis, have been reported rarely and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary symptoms ranging from dyspnea to respiratory failure in post-transplant patients receiving CELLCEPT.

   5.1 Embryofetal Toxicity



   Use of MMF during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of first trimester pregnancy loss and an increased risk of congenital malformations, especially external ear and other facial abnormalities including cleft lip and palate, and anomalies of the distal limbs, heart, esophagus, kidney and nervous system. Females of reproductive potential must be made aware of these risks and must be counseled regarding pregnancy prevention and planning. Avoid use of MMF during pregnancy if safer treatment options are available [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1  ,  8.3)  ].    



    5.2 Lymphoma and Other Malignancies



  Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including CELLCEPT, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent. For patients with increased risk for skin cancer, exposure to sunlight and UV light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor.



 Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) developed in 0.4% to 1% of patients receiving CELLCEPT (2 g or 3 g) with other immunosuppressive agents in controlled clinical trials of kidney, heart, and liver transplant patients [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . In pediatric patients, no other malignancies besides PTLD were observed in clinical trials [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  



    5.3 Serious Infections



  Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including CELLCEPT, are at increased risk of developing bacterial, fungal, protozoal and new or reactivated viral infections, including opportunistic infections. The risk increases with the total immunosuppressive load. These infections may lead to serious outcomes, including hospitalizations and death [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ,  (6.2)  ].  



 Serious viral infections reported include:



 *  Polyomavirus-associated nephropathy (PVAN), especially due to BK virus infection 
 *  JC virus-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), and 
 *  Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections: CMV seronegative transplant patients who receive an organ from a CMV seropositive donor are at highest risk of CMV viremia and CMV disease. 
 *  Viral reactivation in patients infected with Hepatitis B and C 
    Consider reducing immunosuppression in patients who develop new infections or reactivate viral infections, weighing the risk that reduced immunosuppression represents to the functioning allograft.
 

 PVAN, especially due to BK virus infection, is associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ].  Patient monitoring may help detect patients at risk for PVAN.



 PML, which is sometimes fatal, commonly presents with hemiparesis, apathy, confusion, cognitive deficiencies, and ataxia [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ]  . In immunosuppressed patients, physicians should consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients reporting neurological symptoms.



 The risk of CMV viremia and CMV disease is highest among transplant recipients seronegative for CMV at time of transplant who receive a graft from a CMV seropositive donor. Therapeutic approaches to limiting CMV disease exist and should be routinely provided. Patient monitoring may help detect patients at risk for CMV disease.



 Viral reactivation has been reported in patients infected with HBV or HCV. Monitoring infected patients for clinical and laboratory signs of active HBV or HCV infection is recommended.



    5.4 Blood Dyscrasias: Neutropenia and Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA)



  Severe neutropenia [absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;0.5 * 10  3  /uL] developed in transplant patients receiving CELLCEPT 3 g daily [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Patients receiving CELLCEPT should be monitored for neutropenia. Neutropenia has been observed most frequently in the period from 31 to 180 days post-transplant in patients treated for prevention of kidney, heart and liver rejection. The development of neutropenia may be related to CELLCEPT itself, concomitant medications, viral infections, or a combination of these causes. If neutropenia develops (ANC &lt;1.3 * 10  3  /uL), dosing with CELLCEPT should be interrupted or the dose reduced, appropriate diagnostic tests performed, and the patient managed appropriately [see  Dosage and Administration (2.5)  ].  



 Patients receiving CELLCEPT should be instructed to report immediately any evidence of infection, unexpected bruising, bleeding or any other manifestation of bone marrow depression.



 Consider monitoring with complete blood counts weekly for the first month, twice monthly for the second and third months and, monthly for the remainder of the first year.



 Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with CELLCEPT in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. In some cases, PRCA was found to be reversible with dose reduction or cessation of CELLCEPT therapy. In transplant patients, however, reduced immunosuppression may place the graft at risk.



    5.5 Gastrointestinal Complications



  Gastrointestinal bleeding requiring hospitalization, ulceration and perforations were observed in clinical trials. Physicians should be aware of these serious adverse effects particularly when administering CELLCEPT to patients with a gastrointestinal disease.



    5.6 Patients with Hypoxanthine-Guanine Phosphoribosyl-Transferase Deficiency (HGPRT)



  CELLCEPT is an inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibitor; therefore it should be avoided in patients with hereditary deficiencies of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase (HGPRT) such as Lesch-Nyhan and Kelley-Seegmiller syndromes because it may cause an exacerbation of disease symptoms characterized by the overproduction and accumulation of uric acid leading to symptoms associated with gout such as acute arthritis, tophi, nephrolithiasis or urolithiasis and renal disease including renal failure.



    5.7 Immunizations



  During treatment with CELLCEPT, the use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided and patients should be advised that vaccinations may be less effective. Advise patients to discuss with the physician before seeking any immunizations.



    5.8 Local Reactions with Rapid Intravenous Administration



  CELLCEPT Intravenous solution must not be administered by rapid or bolus intravenous injection as rapid infusion increases the risk of local adverse reactions such as phlebitis and thrombosis [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



    5.9 Risks in Patients with Phenylketonuria



  Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). CELLCEPT Oral Suspension contains aspartame, a source of phenylalanine (0.56 mg phenylalanine/mL suspension). Before prescribing CELLCEPT Oral Suspension to a patient with PKU, consider the combined daily amount of phenylalanine from all sources, including CELLCEPT.



    5.10 Blood Donation



  Patients should not donate blood during therapy and for at least 6 weeks following discontinuation of CELLCEPT because their blood or blood products might be administered to a female of reproductive potential or a pregnant woman.



    5.11 Semen Donation



  Based on animal data, men should not donate semen during therapy and for 90 days following discontinuation of CELLCEPT [see  Use In Specific Populations (8.3)  ]  .
