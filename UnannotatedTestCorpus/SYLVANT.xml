  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 Study 1, in MCD, was an international, multicenter, randomized Phase 2 study of every 3 week infusions comparing SYLVANT and best supportive care (BSC) to placebo and BSC. There were 53 patients randomized to the SYLVANT arm at a dosage of 11 mg/kg and 26 patients randomized to the placebo arm. Of the 26 placebo-treated patients, 13 patients subsequently crossed-over to receive SYLVANT. The median age was 48 years (range 20 to 78), 66% male, 48% Asian, 39% White, 4% Black or African American, 7% other. The patients randomized to SYLVANT received a median of 19 infusions (range 1 to 50) compared to patients randomized to placebo who received a median of 8 infusions (range 2 to 32). To control for disparate exposure between arms, Table 3 reports the per patient incidence of adverse reactions that occurred during the first 8 infusions. Adverse reactions that occurred &gt;3% in the SYLVANT arm are presented.



 The most common adverse reactions (&gt; 10% compared to placebo) during treatment with SYLVANT in the MCD clinical trial were rash, pruritus, upper respiratory tract infection, increased weight, and hyperuricemia.

           Study CNTO328MCD2002 (referred to as Study 2) (NCT01400503) was an open label, long term extension study of patients with MCD treated on prior trials. The median duration of siltuximab treatment was 5.52 years (range: 0.8 to 10.8 years); more than 50% of patients received siltuximab treatment for &gt;=5 years. The rate of serious or Grade &gt;=3 adverse events did not increase over time as a function of cumulative exposure.
 

 Other important adverse reactions reported in MCD clinical studies, all of which were very common, were:



 Infections and infestations: nasopharyngitis, urinary tract infection



 Blood and lymphatic system disorders: neutropenia



 Nervous system disorders: dizziness



 Vascular disorders: hypertension



 Gastrointestinal disorders: nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, gastroesophageal reflux disease, mouth ulceration



     Immunogenicity  



 Immunogenicity data are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the test methods used. Additionally, the observed incidence of a positive result in a test method may be influenced by several factors, including sample handling, timing of sample collection, drug interference, concomitant medication and the underlying disease. Therefore, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to SYLVANT with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. The clinical significance of anti-siltuximab antibodies following treatment with SYLVANT is not known.



 The immunogenicity of siltuximab has been evaluated using antigen-bridging enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and electrochemiluminescence-based immunoassay (ECLIA) methods. A total of 432 patients across the clinical studies were evaluated at multiple time points for anti-therapeutic antibody (ATA) responses to siltuximab after treatment with SYLVANT. Following SYLVANT dosing, 0/243 (0%) patients tested positive for anti-siltuximab antibodies by EIA and 4/189 (2%) patients tested positive by ECLIA. Further immunogenicity analyses were conducted for all positive samples from the 4 patients with detectable anti-siltuximab antibodies. None of these patients had neutralizing antibodies.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Concurrent Active Severe Infections: Do not administer SYLVANT to patients with severe infections, monitor for infections, institute prompt treatment, and interrupt SYLVANT until resolution of infection. (  2  ,  5.1  ) 
 *  Vaccinations: Do not administer live vaccines because IL-6 inhibition may interfere with the normal immune response to new antigens. (  5.2  ) 
 *  Infusion Related Reactions: Administer SYLVANT in a setting that provides resuscitation equipment, medication, and personnel trained to provide resuscitation. (  5.3  ,  6.1  ) 
 *  Gastrointestinal (GI) perforation: Promptly evaluate patients presenting with symptoms that may be associated or suggestive of GI perforation. (  5.4  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Concurrent Active Severe Infections



  Do not administer SYLVANT to patients with severe infections until the infection resolves. SYLVANT may mask signs and symptoms of acute inflammation including suppression of fever and of acute Phase reactants such as C-reactive protein (CRP). Monitor patients receiving SYLVANT closely for infections. Institute prompt anti-infective therapy and do not administer further SYLVANT until the infection resolves.



    5.2 Vaccinations



  Do not administer live vaccines to patients receiving SYLVANT because IL-6 inhibition may interfere with the normal immune response to new antigens.



    5.3 Infusion Related Reactions and Hypersensitivity



   SYLVANT may cause infusion related reactions and anaphylaxis. Approximately 945 patients have been treated with SYLVANT in clinical trials. Of these, one patient experienced an anaphylactic reaction. Data from 254 patients treated with SYLVANT monotherapy forms the basis of the safety evaluation of infusion related reactions. Infusion related reactions were reported in 5.1% of these patients. Two (0.8%) were Grade 3 or higher, and 1 (0.4%) was serious; none were fatal. Symptoms of infusion reactions consisted of back pain, chest pain or discomfort, nausea and vomiting, flushing, erythema, and palpitations.  



  In long-term treatment of MCD patients with siltuximab at the recommended dosage of 11 mg/kg every 3 weeks, infusion related reactions or hypersensitivity reactions occurred at a frequency of 6.3% (1.3% for severe reactions).  



 Stop the infusion of SYLVANT if the patient develops signs of anaphylaxis. Discontinue further therapy with SYLVANT.



 Stop the infusion if the patient develops a mild to moderate infusion reaction. If the reaction resolves, the SYLVANT infusion may be restarted at a lower infusion rate. Consider medication with antihistamines, acetaminophen, and corticosteroids. Discontinue SYLVANT if the patient does not tolerate the infusion following these interventions [see  Adverse Reactions (6)  ].  



 Administer SYLVANT in a setting that provides resuscitation equipment, medication, and personnel trained to provide resuscitation.



    5.4 Gastrointestinal Perforation



  Gastrointestinal (GI) perforation has been reported in clinical trials although not in MCD trials. Use with caution in patients who may be at increased risk for GI perforation. Promptly evaluate patients presenting with symptoms that may be associated or suggestive of GI perforation.
