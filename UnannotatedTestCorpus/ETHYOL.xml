    Controlled Trials  

  In the randomized study of patients with ovarian cancer given ETHYOL at a dose of 910 mg/m  2  prior to chemotherapy, transient hypotension was observed in 62% of patients treated.  The mean time of onset was 14 minutes into the 15-minute period of ETHYOL infusion, and the mean duration was 6 minutes. In some cases, the infusion had to be prematurely terminated due to a more pronounced drop in systolic blood pressure. In general, the blood pressure returned to normal within 5-15 minutes. Fewer than 3% of patients discontinued ETHYOL due to blood pressure reductions. In the randomized study of patients with head and neck cancer given ETHYOL at a dose of 200 mg/m  2  prior to radiotherapy, hypotension was observed in 15% of patients treated. (see TABLE 6)

           In the randomized study of patients with head and neck cancer, 17% (26/150) discontinued ETHYOL due to adverse events. All but one of these patients continued to receive radiation treatment until completion.
 

 Hypotension that requires interruption of the ETHYOL infusion should be treated with fluid infusion and postural management of the patient (supine or Trendelenburg position). If the blood pressure returns to normal within 5 minutes and the patient is asymptomatic, the infusion may be restarted, so that the full dose of ETHYOL canbe administered. Short term, reversible loss of consciousness has been reported rarely.



 Nausea and/or vomiting occur frequently after ETHYOL infusion and may be severe.In the ovarian cancer randomized study, the incidence of severe nausea/vomiting onday 1 of cyclophosphamide-cisplatin chemotherapy was 10% in patients who did not receive ETHYOL, and 19% in patients who did receive ETHYOL. In the randomized study of patients with head and neck cancer, the incidence of severe nausea/vomiting was 8% in patients who received ETHYOL and 1% in patients who did not receive ETHYOL. 



 Decrease in serum calcium concentrations is a known pharmacological effect of ETHYOL. At the recommended doses, clinically significant hypocalcemia was reported in 1% of patients in the randomized head and neck cancer study (see  WARNINGS  ).



 Other effects, which have been described during, or following ETHYOL infusion are flushing/feeling of warmth, chills/feeling of coldness, malaise, fever, rash, dizziness, somnolence, hiccups and sneezing. These effects have not generally precluded the completion of therapy.



     Clinical Trials and Pharmacovigilance Reports  

  Allergic reactions characterized by one or more of the following manifestations have been observed during or after ETHYOL administration: hypotension, fever, chills/rigors, dyspnea, hypoxia, chest tightness, cutaneous eruptions, pruritus, urticaria and laryngeal edema. Cutaneous eruptions have been commonly reported during clinical trials and were generally non-serious. Serious, sometimes fatal skin reactions including erythema multiforme, and in rare cases, exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have also occurred. The reported incidence of serious skin reactions associated with ETHYOL is higher in patients receiving ETHYOL as a radioprotectant than in patients receiving ETHYOL as a chemoprotectant. Rare anaphylactoid reactions and cardiac arrest have also been reported.



 Hypotension, usually brief systolic and diastolic, has been associated with one or more of the following adverse events: apnea, dyspnea, hypoxia, tachycardia, bradycardia, extrasystoles, chest pain, myocardial ischemia and convulsion. Rare cases of renal failure, myocardial infarction, respiratory and cardiac arrest have been observed during or after hypotension. (See  WARNINGS  and  PRECAUTIONS  )



 Rare cases of arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation/flutter and supraventricular tachycardia have been reported. These are sometimes associated with hypotension or allergic reactions.



 Transient hypertension and exacerbations of preexisting hypertension have been observed rarely after ETHYOL administration.



 Seizures and syncope have been reported rarely. (See  WARNINGS  and  PRECAUTIONS  )

    <Section id="S2" name="precautions">     PRECAUTIONS  



    General  



  Patients should be adequately hydrated prior to the ETHYOL infusion and blood pressure should be monitored (see  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  ).



 The safety of ETHYOL administration has not been established in elderly patients, or in patients with preexisting cardiovascular or cerebrovascular conditions such as ischemic heart disease, arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, or history of stroke or transient ischemic attacks. ETHYOL should be used with particular care in these and other patients in whom the common ETHYOL adverse effects of nausea/vomiting and hypotension may be more likely to have serious consequences.



 Prior to chemotherapy, ETHYOL should be administered as a 15-minute infusion (see  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  ). Blood pressure should be monitored every 5 minutes during the infusion, and thereafter as clinically indicated.



 Prior to radiation therapy, ETHYOL should be administered as a 3-minute infusion (see  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  ). Blood pressure should be monitored at least before and immediately after the infusion, and thereafter as clinically indicated.



     Cutaneous Reactions  



  Cutaneous reactions may require permanent discontinuation of ETHYOL or urgent dermatologic consultation and biopsy (see below).



 Cutaneous evaluation of the patient prior to each ETHYOL administration should be performed with particular attention paid to the development of the following:



 -       Any rash involving the lips or involving mucosa not known to be due to another etiology (e.g., radiation mucositis, herpes simplex, etc.)



 -       Erythematous, edematous, or bullous lesions on the palms of the hands or soles of the feet and/or other cutaneous reactions on the trunk (front, back, abdomen)



 -       Cutaneous reactions with associated fever or other constitutional symptoms



 Cutaneous reactions must be clearly differentiated from radiation-induced dermatitis and from cutaneous reactions related to an alternate etiology. ETHYOL should be permanently discontinued for serious or severe cutaneous reactions (see  WARNINGS  and  ADVERSE REACTIONS  ) or for cutaneous reactions associated with fever or other constitutional symptoms not known to be due to another etiology. ETHYOL should be withheld and dermatologic consultation and biopsy considered for cutaneous reactions or mucosal lesions of unknown etiology appearing outside of the injection site or radiation port and for erythematous, edematous or bullous lesions on the palms of the hand or soles of the feet. Reinitiation of ETHYOL should be at the physician's discretion based on medical judgment and appropriate dermatologic evaluation.



     Allergic Reactions  



  In case of severe acute allergic reactions ETHYOL should be immediately and permanently discontinued. Epinephrine and other appropriate measures should be available for treatment of serious allergic events such as anaphylaxis.



     Drug Interactions  



  Special consideration should be given to the administration of ETHYOL in patients receiving antihypertensive medications or other drugs that could cause or potentiate hypotension.



     Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  



  No long term animal studies have been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of ETHYOL. ETHYOL was negative in the Ames test and in the mouse micronucleus test. The free thiol metabolite was positive in the Ames test with S9 microsomal fraction in the TA1535 Salmonella typhimurium  strain and at the TK locus in the mouse L5178Y cell assay. The metabolite was negative in the mouse micronucleus test and negative for clastogenicity in human lymphocytes.



     Pregnancy  



  Pregnancy Category C. ETHYOL has been shown to be embryotoxic in rabbits at doses of 50 mg/kg, approximately sixty percent of the recommended dose in humans on a body surface area basis. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. ETHYOL should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.



     Nursing Mothers  



  No information is available on the excretion of ETHYOL or its metabolites into human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, it is recommended that breast feeding be discontinued if the mother is treated with ETHYOL.



     Pediatric Use  



  The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.



     Geriatric Use  



  The clinical studies did not include sufficient number of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients.

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings">     WARNINGS  



   1.    Effectiveness of the Cytotoxic Regimen  Limited data are currently available regarding the preservation of antitumor efficacy when ETHYOL is administered prior to cisplatin therapy in settings other than advanced ovarian cancer. Although some animal data suggest interference is possible, in most tumor models the antitumor effects of chemotherapy are not altered by amifostine. ETHYOL should not be used in patients receiving chemotherapy for other malignancies in which chemotherapy can produce a significant survival benefit or cure (e.g., certain malignancies of germ cell origin), except in the context of a clinical study.
 

  2.    Effectiveness of Radiotherapy  ETHYOL should not be administered in patients receiving definitive radiotherapy, except in the context of a clinical trial, since there are at present insufficient data to exclude a tumor-protective effect in this setting. ETHYOL was studied only with standard fractionated radiotherapy and only when &gt;=75% of both parotid glands were exposed to radiation. The effects of ETHYOL on the incidence of xerostomia and on toxicity in the setting of combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy and in the setting of accelerated and hyperfractionated therapy have not been systematically studied. 
 

  3.    Hypotension  Patients who are hypotensive or in a state of dehydration should not receive ETHYOL. Patients receiving ETHYOL at doses recommended for chemotherapy should have antihypertensive therapy interrupted 24 hours preceding administration of ETHYOL.  Patients receiving ETHYOL at doses recommended for chemotherapy who are taking antihypertensive therapy that cannot be stopped for 24 hours preceding ETHYOL treatment, should not receive ETHYOL.
 

 Prior to ETHYOL infusion patients should be adequately hydrated. During ETHYOL infusion patients should be kept in a supine position. Blood pressure should be monitored every 5 minutes during the infusion, and thereafter as clinically indicated. It is important that the duration of the 910 mg/m  2  infusion not exceed 15 minutes, as administration of ETHYOL as a longer infusion is associated with a higher incidence of side effects. For infusion durations less than 5 minutes, blood pressure should be monitored at least before and immediately after the infusion, and thereafter as clinically indicated. If hypotension occurs, patients should be placed in the Trendelenburg position and be given an infusion of normal saline using a separate i.v. line. During and after ETHYOL infusion, care should be taken to monitor the blood pressure of patients whose antihypertensive medication has been interrupted since hypertension may be exacerbated by discontinuation of antihypertensive medication and other causes such as i.v. hydration.



 Guidelines for interrupting and restarting ETHYOL infusion if a decrease in systolic blood pressure should occur are provided in the  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  section. Hypotension may occur during or shortly after ETHYOL infusion, despite adequate hydration and positioning of the patient (see  ADVERSE REACTIONS  and  PRECAUTIONS  ). Hypotension has been reported to be associated with dyspnea, apnea, hypoxia, and in rare cases seizures, unconsciousness, respiratory arrest and renal failure.



  4.    Cutaneous Reactions  Serious cutaneous reactions have been associated with ETHYOL administration. Serious cutaneous reactions have included erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, toxoderma and exfoliative dermatitis. These reactions have been reported more frequently when ETHYOL is used as a radioprotectant (see  ADVERSE REACTIONS  ). Some of these reactions have been fatal or have required hospitalization and/or discontinuance of therapy .  Patients should be carefully monitored prior to, during and after ETHYOL administration. Serious cutaneous reactions may develop weeks after initiation of ETHYOL administration (see  PRECAUTIONS  ).
 

 5.    Hypersensitivity



  Allergic manifestations including anaphylaxis and severe cutaneous reactions have been associated with ETHYOL administration.  
 

  6.    Nausea and Vomiting  Antiemetic medication should be administered prior to and in conjunction with ETHYOL (see  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATlON  ). When ETHYOL is administered with highly emetogenic chemotherapy, the fluid balance of the patient should be carefully monitored.
 

  7.    Hypocalcemia  Serum calcium levels should be monitored in patients at risk of hypocalcemia, such as those with nephrotic syndrome or patients receiving multiple doses of ETHYOL (see  ADVERSE REACTIONS  ). If necessary, calcium supplements can be administered.
