  Clinical trials with ribavirin in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b have been conducted in over 7800 subjects from 3 to 76 years of age.



 The primary toxicity of ribavirin is hemolytic anemia. Reductions in hemoglobin levels occurred within the first 1 to 2 weeks of oral therapy. Cardiac and pulmonary reactions associated with anemia occurred in approximately 10% of patients [see  Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )  ].



 Greater than 96% of all subjects in clinical trials experienced one or more adverse reactions. The most commonly reported adverse reactions in adult subjects receiving peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin were injection site inflammation/reaction, fatigue/asthenia, headache, rigors, fevers, nausea, myalgia and anxiety/emotional lability/irritability. The most common adverse reactions in pediatric subjects, ages 3 and older, receiving ribavirin in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b were pyrexia, headache, neutropenia, fatigue, anorexia, injection site erythema, and vomiting.



 The Adverse Reactions section references the following clinical trials:



 *    *    Clinical Study 1 - evaluated peginterferon alfa-2b monotherapy (not further described in this label; see labeling for peginterferon alfa-2b for information about this trial). 
 *    Study 2 - evaluated ribavirin capsules 800 mg/day flat dose in combination with 1.5 mcg/kg/week peginterferon alfa-2b or with interferon alfa-2b. 
 *    Study 3 - evaluated peginterferon alfa-2b/weight-based ribavirin capsules in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b/flat dose ribavirin capsules regimen. 
 *    Study 4- compared two peginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 mcg/kg/week and 1 mcg/kg/week) doses in combination with ribavirin capsules and a third treatment group receiving peginterferon alfa-2a (180 mcg/week)/ribavirin tablets (1000-1200 mg/day). 
 *    Study 5 - evaluated peginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 mcg/kg/week) in combination with weight-based ribavirin capsules in prior treatment failure subjects. 
   Ribavirin/Peginterferon alfa-2b Combination therapy trials: 
 *    Peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin capsules Combination Therapy in Pediatric Patients 
 *    Ribavirin capsules/interferon alfa-2b Combination Therapy trials for adults and pediatrics 
    Serious adverse reactions have occurred in approximately 12% of subjects in clinical trials with peginterferon alfa-2b with or without ribavirin [see    BOXED WARNING  , Warnings and Precautions (  5  )  ]. The most common serious events occurring in subjects treated with peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin were depression and suicidal ideation [see  Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )  ], each occurring at a frequency of less than 1%. Suicidal ideation or attempts occurred more frequently among pediatric patients, primarily adolescents, compared to adult patients (2.4% versus 1%) during treatment and off-therapy follow-up [see  Warnings and Precautions (  5.10  )  ]. The most common fatal reaction occurring in subjects treated with peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin was cardiac arrest, suicide ideation, and suicide attempt [see  Warnings and Precautions (  5.10  )  ], all occurring in less than 1% of subjects.
 

 Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



   EXCERPT:   Hemolytic anemia. (    6.1    )



 Most common adverse reactions (approximately 40%) in adult patients receiving RIBASPHERE/peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b combination therapy are injection site reaction, fatigue/asthenia, headache, rigors, fevers, nausea, myalgia and anxiety/emotional lability/irritability. (    6.1    ,    6.2    )



 Most common adverse reactions (greater than 25%) in pediatric patients receiving RIBASPHERE/peginterferon alfa-2b therapy are: pyrexia, headache, neutropenia, fatigue, anorexia, injection site erythema, and vomiting. (    6.1    )

          The incidence of serious adverse reactions was comparable in all trials. In Study 3, there was a similar incidence of serious adverse reactions reported for the weight-based ribavirin group (12%) and for the flat-dose ribavirin regimen. In Study 2, the incidence of serious adverse reactions was 17% in the peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin groups compared to 14% in the interferon alfa-2b/ribavirin group.
 

 In many but not all cases, adverse reactions resolved after dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy. Some subjects experienced ongoing or new serious adverse reactions during the 6-month follow-up period. In Study 2, many subjects continued to experience adverse reactions several months after discontinuation of therapy. By the end of the 6-month follow-up period, the incidence of ongoing adverse reactions by body class in the peginterferon alfa-2b 1.5/ribavirin group was 33% (psychiatric), 20% (musculoskeletal), and 10% (for endocrine and for GI). In approximately 10 to 15% of subjects, weight loss, fatigue, and headache had not resolved.



 There have been 31 subject deaths that occurred during treatment or during follow-up in these clinical trials. In Study 1, there was 1 suicide in a subject receiving peginterferon alfa-2b monotherapy and 2 deaths among subjects receiving interferon alfa-2b monotherapy (1 murder/suicide and 1 sudden death). In Study 2, there was 1 suicide in a subject receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin combination therapy; and 1 subject death in the interferon alfa-2b/ribavirin group (motor vehicle accident). In Study 3, there were 14 deaths, 2 of which were probable suicides and 1 was an unexplained death in a person with a relevant medical history of depression. In Study 4, there were 12 deaths, 6 of which occurred in subjects who received peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin combination therapy, 5 in the peginterferon alfa-2b 1.5 mcg/ribavirin arm (N=1019) and 1 in the peginterferon alfa-2b 1 mcg/ribavirin arm (N=1016), and 6 of which occurred in subjects receiving peginterferon alfa-2a/ribavirin tablets (N=1035); there were 3 suicides that occurred during the off treatment follow-up period in subjects who received peginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 mcg/kg)/ribavirin combination therapy.



 In Studies 1 and 2, 10 to 14% of subjects receiving peginterferon alfa-2b, alone or in combination with ribavirin, discontinued therapy compared with 6% treated with interferon alfa-2b alone and 13% treated with interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin. Similarly in Study 3, 15% of subjects receiving peginterferon alfa-2b in combination with weight-based ribavirin and 14% of subjects receiving peginterferon alfa-2b and flat dose ribavirin discontinued therapy due to an adverse reaction. The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy were related to known interferon effects of psychiatric, systemic (e.g., fatigue, headache), or gastrointestinal adverse reactions. In Study 4, 13% of subjects in the peginterferon alfa-2b 1.5 mcg/ribavirin arm, 10% in the peginterferon alfa-2b 1 mcg/ribavirin arm and 13% in the peginterferon alfa-2a 180 mcg/ribavirin tablets arm discontinued due to adverse events.



 In Study 2, dose reductions due to adverse reactions occurred in 42% of subjects receiving peginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 mcg/kg)/ribavirin and in 34% of those receiving interferon alfa-2b/ribavirin. The majority of subjects (57%) weighing 60 kg or less receiving peginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 mcg/kg)/ribavirin required dose reduction. Reduction of interferon was dose-related (peginterferon alfa-2b 1.5 mcg/kg greater than peginterferon alfa-2b 0.5 mcg/kg or interferon alfa-2b), 40%, 27%, 28%, respectively. Dose reduction for ribavirin was similar across all three groups, 33 to 35%. The most common reasons for dose modifications were neutropenia (18%), or anemia (9%) (see    Laboratory Values    ). Other common reasons included depression, fatigue, nausea, and thrombocytopenia. In Study 3, dose modifications due to adverse reactions occurred more frequently with weight-based dosing (WBD) compared to flat dosing (29% and 23%, respectively). In Study 4, 16% of subjects had a dose reduction of peginterferon alfa-2b to 1 mcg/kg in combination with ribavirin, with an additional 4% requiring the second dose reduction of peginterferon alfa-2b to 0.5 mcg/kg due to adverse events compared to 15% of subjects in the peginterferon alfa-2a/ribavirin tablets arm, who required a dose reduction to 135 mcg/week with peginterferon alfa-2a, with an additional 7% in the peginterferon alfa-2a/ribavirin tablets arm requiring second dose reduction to 90 mcg/week with peginterferon alfa-2a.



 In the peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin combination trials the most common adverse reactions were psychiatric, which occurred among 77% of subjects in Study 2 and 68% to 69% of subjects in Study 3. These psychiatric adverse reactions included most commonly depression, irritability, and insomnia, each reported by approximately 30% to 40% of subjects in all treatment groups. Suicidal behavior (ideation, attempts, and suicides) occurred in 2% of all subjects during treatment or during follow-up after treatment cessation [see  Warnings and Precautions (  5  )  ]. In Study 4, psychiatric adverse reactions occurred in 58% of subjects in the peginterferon alfa-2b 1.5 mcg/ribavirin arm, 55% of subjects in the peginterferon alfa-2b 1 mcg/ribavirin arm, and 57% of subjects in the peginterferon alfa-2a 180 mcg/ribavirin tablets arm.



 Peginterferon alfa-2b induced fatigue or headache in approximately two-thirds of subjects, with fever or rigors in approximately half of the subjects. The severity of some of these systemic symptoms (e.g., fever and headache) tended to decrease as treatment continued. In Studies 1 and 2, application site inflammation and reaction (e.g., bruise, itchiness, and irritation) occurred at approximately twice the incidence with peginterferon alfa-2b therapies (in up to 75% of subjects) compared with interferon alfa-2b. However, injection site pain was infrequent (2 to 3%) in all groups. In Study 3, there was a 23% to 24% incidence overall for injection site reactions or inflammation.



 Subjects receiving ribavirin/peginterferon alfa-2b as re-treatment after failing a previous interferon combination regimen reported adverse reactions similar to those previously associated with this regimen during clinical trials of treatment-naive subjects.



     Pediatric Subjects    



 In general, the adverse-reaction profile in the pediatric population was similar to that observed in adults. In the pediatric trial, the most prevalent adverse reactions in all subjects were pyrexia (80%), headache (62%), neutropenia (33%), fatigue (30%), anorexia (29%), injection-site erythema (29%) and vomiting (27%). The majority of adverse reactions reported in the trial were mild or moderate in severity. Severe adverse reactions were reported in 7% (8/107) of all subjects and included injection site pain (1%), pain in extremity (1%), headache (1%), neutropenia (1%), and pyrexia (4%). Important adverse reactions that occurred in this subject population were nervousness (7%; 7/107), aggression (3%; 3/107), anger (2%; 2/107), and depression (1%; 1/107). Five subjects received levothyroxine treatment, three with clinical hypothyroidism and two with asymptomatic TSH elevations. Weight and height gain of pediatric subjects treated with peginterferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin lagged behind that predicted by normative population data for the entire length of treatment. Severely inhibited growth velocity (less than 3rd percentile) was observed in 70% of the subjects while on treatment.



 Dose modifications of peginterferon alfa-2b and/or ribavirin were required in 25% of subjects due to treatment-related adverse reactions, most commonly for anemia, neutropenia and weight loss. Two subjects (2%; 2/107) discontinued therapy as the result of an adverse reaction.



 Adverse reactions that occurred with a greater than or equal to 10% incidence in the pediatric trial subjects are provided in  Table 7  .

        Ninety-four of 107 subjects enrolled in a 5 year long-term follow-up trial. The long-term effects on growth were less in those subjects treated for 24 weeks than those treated for 48 weeks. Twenty-four percent of subjects (11/46) treated for 24 weeks and 40% of subjects (19/48) treated for 48 weeks had a &gt;15 percentile height-for-age decrease from pre-treatment to the end of 5 year long-term follow-up compared to pre-treatment baseline percentiles. Eleven percent of subjects (5/46) treated for 24 weeks and 13% of subjects (6/48) treated for 48 weeks were observed to have a decrease from pre-treatment baseline of &gt;30 height-for-age percentiles to the end of the 5 year long-term follow-up. While observed across all age groups, the highest risk for reduced height at the end of long-term follow-up appeared to correlate with initiation of combination therapy during the years of expected peak growth velocity.

     Laboratory Values    



   Adult and Pediatric Subjects  



 The adverse reaction profile in Study 3, which compared peginterferon alfa-2b/weight-based ribavirin combination to a peginterferon alfa-2b/flat dose ribavirin regimen, revealed an increased rate of anemia with weight-based dosing (29% vs. 19% for weight-based vs. flat dose regimens, respectively). However, the majority of cases of anemia were mild and responded to dose reductions.



 Changes in selected laboratory values during treatment in combination with ribavirin treatment are described below.  Decreases in hemoglobin, leukocytes, neutrophils, and platelets may require dose reduction or permanent discontinuation from therapy  [see  Dosage and Administration (  2.4  )  ]. Changes in selected laboratory values during therapy are described in  Table 8  . Most of the changes in laboratory values in the peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin trial with pediatrics were mild or moderate.

            Hemoglobin  . Hemoglobin levels decreased to less than 11 g/dL in about 30% of subjects in Study 2. In Study 3, 47% of subjects receiving WBD ribavirin and 33% on flat-dose ribavirin had decreases in hemoglobin levels less than 11 g/dL. Reductions in hemoglobin to less than 9 g/dL occurred more frequently in subjects receiving WBD compared to flat dosing (4% and 2%, respectively). In Study 2, dose modification was required in 9% and 13% of subjects in the peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b/ribavirin groups. In Study 4, subjects receiving peginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 mcg/kg)/ribavirin had decreases in hemoglobin levels to between 8.5 to less than 10 g/dL (28%) and to less than 8.5 g/dL (3%), whereas in patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2a 180 mcg/ribavirin tablets these decreases occurred in 26% and 4% of subjects respectively. Hemoglobin levels became stable by treatment Weeks 4-6 on average. The typical pattern observed was a decrease in hemoglobin levels by treatment Week 4 followed by stabilization and a plateau, which was maintained to the end of treatment. In the peginterferon alfa-2b monotherapy trial, hemoglobin decreases were generally mild and dose modifications were rarely necessary [see  Dosage and Administration (  2.4  )  ].
 

   Neutrophils  . Decreases in neutrophil counts were observed in a majority of adult subjects treated with combination therapy with ribavirin in Study 2 (85%) and interferon alfa-2b/ribavirin (60%). Severe potentially life-threatening neutropenia (less than 0.5 x 10  9  /L) occurred in 2% of subjects treated with interferon alfa-2b/ribavirin and in approximately 4% of subjects treated with peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin in Study 2. Eighteen percent of subjects receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin in Study 2 required modification of interferon dosage. Few subjects (less than 1%) required permanent discontinuation of treatment. Neutrophil counts generally returned to pre-treatment levels 4 weeks after cessation of therapy [see  Dosage and Administration (  2.4  )  ].



   Platelets.  Platelet counts decreased to less than 100,000/mm  3  in approximately 20% of subjects treated with peginterferon alfa-2b alone or with ribavirin and in 6% of adult subjects treated with interferon alfa-2b/ribavirin. Severe decreases in platelet counts (less than 50,000/mm  3  ) occur in less than 4% of adult subjects. Patients may require discontinuation or dose modification as a result of platelet decreases [see  Dosage and Administration (  2.4  )  ]. In Study 2, 1% or 3% of subjects required dose modification of interferon alfa-2b or peginterferon alfa-2b, respectively. Platelet counts generally returned to pretreatment levels 4 weeks after the cessation of therapy.



   Thyroid Function.  Development of TSH abnormalities, with or without clinical manifestations, is associated with interferon therapies. In Study 2, clinically apparent thyroid disorders occurred among subjects treated with either interferon alfa-2b or peginterferon alfa-2b (with or without ribavirin) at a similar incidence (5% for hypothyroidism and 3% for hyperthyroidism). Subjects developed new onset TSH abnormalities while on treatment and during the follow-up period. At the end of the follow-up period 7% of subjects still had abnormal TSH values.



   Bilirubin and uric acid.  In Study 2, 10 to 14% of subjects developed hyperbilirubinemia and 33 to 38% developed hyperuricemia in association with hemolysis. Six subjects developed mild to moderate gout.



   6.2 Clinical Trials Experience - Ribavirin/Interferon alfa-2b Combination Therapy

    Adult Subjects  



 In clinical trials, 19% and 6% of previously untreated and relapse subjects, respectively, discontinued therapy due to adverse reactions in the combination arms compared to 13% and 3% in the interferon arms. Selected treatment-related adverse reactions that occurred in the US trials with greater than or equal to 5% incidence are provided by treatment group (see  Table 9  ). In general, the selected treatment-related adverse reactions were reported with lower incidence in the international trials as compared to the US trials, with the exception of asthenia, influenza-like symptoms, nervousness, and pruritus.



   Pediatric Subjects  



 In clinical trials of 118 pediatric subjects 3 to 16 years of age, 6% discontinued therapy due to adverse reactions. Dose modifications were required in 30% of subjects, most commonly for anemia and neutropenia. In general, the adverse-reaction profile in the pediatric population was similar to that observed in adults. Injection site disorders, fever, anorexia, vomiting, and emotional lability occurred more frequently in pediatric subjects compared to adult subjects. Conversely, pediatric subjects experienced less fatigue, dyspepsia, arthralgia, insomnia, irritability, impaired concentration, dyspnea, and pruritus compared to adult subjects. Selected treatment-related adverse reactions that occurred with greater than or equal to 5% incidence among all pediatric subjects who received the recommended dose of ribavirin/interferon alfa-2b combination therapy are provided in  Table 9  .

              During a 48-week course of therapy there was a decrease in the rate of linear growth (mean percentile assignment decrease of 7%) and a decrease in the rate of weight gain (mean percentile assignment decrease of 9%). A general reversal of these trends was noted during the 24-week post-treatment period. Long-term data in a limited number of patients, however, suggests that combination therapy may induce a growth inhibition that results in reduced final adult height in some patients [  see Warnings and Precautions (  5.9  )  ].
 

   Laboratory Values  



 Changes in selected hematologic values (hemoglobin, white blood cells, neutrophils, and platelets) during therapy are described below (see  Table 10  ).



   Hemoglobin.  Hemoglobin decreases among subjects receiving ribavirin therapy began at Week 1, with stabilization by Week 4. In previously untreated subjects treated for 48 weeks, the mean maximum decrease from baseline was 3.1 g/dL in the US trial and 2.9 g/dL in the international trial. In relapse subjects, the mean maximum decrease from baseline was 2.8 g/dL in the US trial and 2.6 g/dL in the international trial. Hemoglobin values returned to pretreatment levels within 4 to 8 weeks of cessation of therapy in most subjects.



   Bilirubin and Uric Acid.  Increases in both bilirubin and uric acid, associated with hemolysis, were noted in clinical trials. Most were moderate biochemical changes and were reversed within 4 weeks after treatment discontinuation. This observation occurred most frequently in subjects with a previous diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome. This has not been associated with hepatic dysfunction or clinical morbidity.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: RISK OF SERIOUS DISORDERS AND RIBAVIRIN-ASSOCIATED EFFECTS

  WARNING: RISK OF SERIOUS DISORDERS AND RIBAVIRIN-ASSOCIATED EFFECTS

    *  RIBASPHERE(r) (ribavirin capsules USP) monotherapy is not effective for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection and should not be used alone for this indication [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. 
 *  The primary toxicity of ribavirin is hemolytic anemia. The anemia associated with RIBASPHERE therapy may result in worsening of cardiac disease that has led to fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarctions. Patients with a history of significant or unstable cardiac disease should not be treated with RIBASPHERE [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2), and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 
 *  Significant teratogenic and embryocidal effects have been demonstrated in all animal species exposed to ribavirin. In addition, ribavirin has a multiple-dose half-life of 12 days, and so it may persist in nonplasma compartments for as long as 6 months. Therefore, RIBASPHERE therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant and in the male partners of women who are pregnant. Extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy during therapy and for 6 months after completion of treatment in both female patients and in female partners of male patients who are taking RIBASPHERE therapy. At least two reliable forms of effective contraception must be utilized during treatment and during the 6-month post-treatment follow-up period [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1), and Patient Counseling Information (17.2)].

   5.1 Pregnancy



   RIBASPHERE (ribavirin capsules) may cause birth defects and death of the unborn child. RIBASPHERE therapy should not be started until a report of a negative pregnancy test has been obtained immediately prior to planned initiation of therapy. Patients should use at least two forms of contraception and have monthly pregnancy tests during treatment and during the 6-month period after treatment has been stopped.  Extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients and in female partners of male patients. Ribavirin has demonstrated significant teratogenic and embryocidal effects in all animal species in which adequate studies have been conducted. These effects occurred at doses as low as one twentieth of the recommended human dose of ribavirin. RIBASPHERE therapy should not be started until a report of a negative pregnancy test has been obtained immediately prior to planned initiation of therapy [see   Boxed Warning  , Contraindications (  4  ), Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  ),  and Patient Counseling Information (  17.2  )  ].



    5.2 Anemia



  The primary toxicity of ribavirin is hemolytic anemia, which was observed in approximately 10% of RIBASPHERE/interferon alfa-2b treated subjects in clinical trials. The anemia associated with RIBASPHERE capsules occurs within 1 to 2 weeks of initiation of therapy. Because the initial drop in hemoglobin may be significant, it is advised that hemoglobin or hematocrit be obtained before the start of treatment and at Week 2 and Week 4 of therapy, or more frequently if clinically indicated. Patients should then be followed as clinically appropriate [see Dosage and Administration (  2.4  ,  2.5  )  ].



 Fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarctions have been reported in patients with anemia caused by ribavirin. Patients should be assessed for underlying cardiac disease before initiation of ribavirin therapy. Patients with pre-existing cardiac disease should have electrocardiograms administered before treatment, and should be appropriately monitored during therapy. If there is any deterioration of cardiovascular status, therapy should be suspended or discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (  2.4  ,  2.5  )  ]. Because cardiac disease may be worsened by drug-induced anemia, patients with a history of significant or unstable cardiac disease should not use RIBASPHERE.



    5.3 Pancreatitis



  RIBASPHERE and interferon alfa-2b or peginterferon alfa-2b therapy should be suspended in patients with signs and symptoms of pancreatitis and discontinued in patients with confirmed pancreatitis.



    5.4 Pulmonary Disorders



  Pulmonary symptoms, including dyspnea, pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, pulmonary hypertension, and pneumonia, have been reported during therapy with ribavirin with alpha interferon combination therapy; occasional cases of fatal pneumonia have occurred. In addition, sarcoidosis or the exacerbation of sarcoidosis has been reported. If there is evidence of pulmonary infiltrates or pulmonary function impairment, the patient should be closely monitored, and if appropriate, combination therapy should be discontinued.



    5.5 Ophthalmologic Disorders



  Ribavirin is used in combination therapy with alpha interferons. Decrease or loss of vision, retinopathy including macular edema, retinal artery or vein, thrombosis, retinal hemorrhages and cotton wool spots, optic neuritis, papilledema, and serous retinal detachment are induced or aggravated by treatment with alpha interferons. All patients should receive an eye examination at baseline. Patients with pre-existing ophthalmologic disorders (e.g., diabetic or hypertensive retinopathy) should receive periodic ophthalmologic exams during combination therapy with alpha interferon treatment. Any patient who develops ocular symptoms should receive a prompt and complete eye examination. Combination therapy with alpha interferons should be discontinued in patients who develop new or worsening ophthalmologic disorders.



    5.6 Laboratory Tests



  Peginterferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin may cause severe decreases in neutrophil and platelet counts, and hematologic, endocrine (e.g., TSH), and hepatic abnormalities.



 Patients on peginterferon alfa-2b/ RIBASPHERE combination therapy should have hematology and blood chemistry testing before the start of treatment and then periodically thereafter. In the adult clinical trial, complete blood counts (including hemoglobin, neutrophil, and platelet counts) and chemistries (including AST, ALT, bilirubin, and uric acid) were measured during the treatment period at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and then at 6-week intervals, or more frequently if abnormalities developed. In pediatric subjects, the same laboratory parameters were evaluated with additional assessment of hemoglobin at treatment Week 6. TSH levels were measured every 12 weeks during the treatment period. HCV-RNA should be measured periodically during treatment [see Dosage and Administration (  2  )  ].



    5.7 Dental and Periodontal Disorders



  Dental and periodontal disorders have been reported in patients receiving ribavirin and interferon or peginterferon combination therapy. In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of ribavirin and pegylated or nonpegylated interferon alfa-2b. Patients should brush their teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations. If vomiting occurs, they should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.



    5.8 Concomitant Administration of Azathioprine



  Pancytopenia (marked decreases in red blood cells, neutrophils, and platelets) and bone marrow suppression have been reported in the literature to occur within 3 to 7 weeks after the concomitant administration of pegylated interferon/ribavirin and azathioprine. In this limited number of patients (n=8), myelotoxicity was reversible within 4 to 6 weeks upon withdrawal of both HCV antiviral therapy and concomitant azathioprine and did not recur upon reintroduction of either treatment alone. Peginterferon alfa-2b, RIBASPHERE and azathioprine should be discontinued for pancytopenia, and pegylated interferon/ribavirin should not be reintroduced with concomitant azathioprine [see Drug Interactions (  7.4  )  ].



    5.9 Impact on Growth - Pediatric Use



  Data on the effects of peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin on growth come from an open-label study in subjects 3 through 17 years of age, in which weight and height changes are compared to US normative population data. In general, the weight and height gain of pediatric subjects treated with peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin lags behind that predicted by normative population data for the entire length of treatment. Severely inhibited growth velocity (less than 3rd percentile) was observed in 70% of the subjects while on treatment. Following treatment, rebound growth and weight gain occurred in most subjects. Long-term follow-up data in pediatric subjects, however, indicates that peginterferon alfa-2b in combination therapy with ribavirin may induce a growth inhibition that results in reduced adult height in some patients [ see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )  ].



 Similarly, an impact on growth was seen in subjects after treatment with ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b combination therapy for one year. In a long-term follow-up trial of a limited number of these subjects, combination therapy resulted in reduced final adult height in some subjects [ see Adverse Reactions (  6.2  )  ].



    5.10 Usage Safeguards



  Based on results of clinical trials, ribavirin monotherapy is not effective for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection; therefore, RIBASPHERE capsules must not be used alone. The safety and efficacy of ribavirin capsules have only been established when used together with interferon alfa-2b or peginterferon alfa-2b (not other interferons) as combination therapy.



 The safety and efficacy of ribavirin/interferon alfa-2b and peginterferon alfa-2b therapy for the treatment of HIV infection, adenovirus, RSV, parainfluenza, or influenza infections have not been established. RIBASPHERE capsules should not be used for these indications. Ribavirin for inhalation has separate labeling, which should be consulted if ribavirin inhalation therapy is being considered.



 There are significant adverse reactions caused by ribavirin/interferon alfa-2b or peginterferon alfa-2b therapy, including severe depression and suicidal ideation, hemolytic anemia, suppression of bone marrow function, autoimmune and infectious disorders, pulmonary dysfunction, pancreatitis, and diabetes. Suicidal ideation or attempts occurred more frequently among pediatric patients, primarily adolescents, compared to adult patients (2.4% versus 1%) during treatment and off-therapy follow-up. Labeling for interferon alfa-2b and peginterferon alfa-2b should be reviewed in their entirety for additional safety information prior to initiation of combination treatment.
