   EXCERPT:    *    The most common adverse reactions in clinical trials (greater than or equal to 2%) were: headache, vaginal candidiasis, nausea, menstrual cramps, breast tenderness, bacterial vaginitis, abnormal cervical smear, acne, mood swings, and weight gain. (  6.1  ) 
      To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-800-399-2561 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or      www.fda.gov/medwatch.    
 

 

  The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in the labeling:



 *  Serious cardiovascular events and stroke [see BOXED WARNING and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (  5.1  )]  
 *  Vascular events [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (  5.1  )]  
 *  Liver disease [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (  5.2  )]  
    Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are:
 

 *  Irregular uterine bleeding 
 *  Nausea 
 *  Breast tenderness 
 *  Headache 
      6.1 Clinical Trial Experience
   Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The data presented in Section 6.1 are from a clinical trial conducted with a 24-day regimen of norethindrone acetate 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 0.020 mg tablets. Mibelas 24 Fe is bioequivalent to these norethindrone acetate/ethinyl estradiol tablets.



     Common Adverse Reactions (Greater Than or Equal to 2% of all Treated Subjects)    



 The most common adverse reactions reported by at least 2% of the 743 women using norethindrone acetate/ethinyl estradiol tablets were the following, in order of decreasing incidence: headache (6.3%), vaginal candidiasis (6.1%), nausea (4.6%), menstrual cramps (4.4%), breast tenderness (3.4%), bacterial vaginitis (3.1%), abnormal cervical smear (3.1%), acne (2.7%), mood swings (2.2%), and weight gain (2.0%).



     Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation    



 Among the 743 women using norethindrone acetate/ethinyl estradiol tablets, 46 women (6.2%) withdrew because of an adverse event. Adverse events occurring in 3 or more subjects leading to discontinuation of treatment were, in decreasing order: abnormal or irregular bleeding (1.3%), nausea (0.8%), menstrual cramps (0.5%), and increased blood pressure (0.4%).



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of a 24-day regimen of norethindrone acetate 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 0.020 mg tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or evaluate a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 Adverse reactions are grouped into System Organ Classes.



     Vascular Disorders    



 Thrombosis/embolism (coronary artery, pulmonary, cerebral, deep vein).



     Hepatobiliary Disorders    



 Cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, hepatic adenoma, hemangioma of liver.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: CIGARETTE SMOKING AND SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS

  WARNING: CIGARETTE SMOKING AND SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS

  EXCERPT:     WARNING: CIGARETTE SMOKING AND SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS  



     See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.    



 *  Women over 35 years old who smoke should not use Mibelas 24 Fe (4) 
 *  Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from combination oral contraceptive (COC) use (4) 
    
 

    WARNING: CIGARETTE SMOKING AND SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS  



   Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from combination oral contraceptive (COC) use. This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked. For this reason, COCs should not be used by women who are over 35 years of age and smoke   [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (  4  )].    



 





    BOXED WARNING: 

    FDA-Approved Patient Labeling  



   Guide for Using     MibelasTM     24 Fe     (my-BELL-as twen-TI-for EFF EE)  



     WARNING TO WOMEN WHO SMOKE  



   Do not use     Mibelas 24 Fe if you smoke cigarettes and are over 35 years old. Smoking increases your risk of serious cardiovascular side effects (heart and blood vessel problems) from birth control pills, including death from heart attack, blood clots or stroke. This risk increases with age and the number of cigarettes you smoke.  



   Birth control pills help to lower the chances of becoming pregnant when taken as directed. They do not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted infections. 



   What is     Mibelas 24 Fe    ?   



 Mibelas 24 Fe is a birth control pill. It contains two female hormones, an estrogen called ethinyl estradiol, and a progestin called norethindrone acetate.



   How well does     Mibelas 24 Fe     work?   



 Your chance of getting pregnant depends on how well you follow the directions for taking your birth control pills. The better you follow the directions, the less chance you have of getting pregnant. 



 Based on the results of one clinical study of a 24-day regimen of norethindrone acetate   1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 0.020 mg tablets lasting six months, about 1 to 4 out of 100 women may get pregnant during the first year they use Mibelas 24 Fe.



 Women with a BMI above 35 kg/m  2   were not studied in the clinical trial, so it is not known how well Mibelas 24 Fe protects against pregnancy in such women. If you are overweight, discuss with your healthcare provider whether Mibelas 24 Fe is the best choice for you. 



 The following chart shows the chance of getting pregnant for women who use different methods of birth control. Each box on the chart contains a list of birth control methods that are similar in effectiveness. The most effective methods are at the top of the chart. The box on the bottom of the chart shows the chance of getting pregnant for women who do not use birth control and are trying to get pregnant.



   How do I take Mibelas 24 Fe?   



 1.        Be sure to read these directions   before you start taking your tablets or anytime you are not sure what to do.



 2.   The tablets may be chewed and swallowed or swallowed whole. You should drink a full glass (8 ounces) of water immediately after chewing or swallowing.



 3.   The right way to take the tablet is to take one tablet every day at the same time in the order directed on the package. Mibelas 24 Fe can be taken without regard to meals. 



 If you miss tablets you could get pregnant. This includes starting the pack late. The more tablets you miss, the more likely you are to get pregnant. See "What to Do if You Miss Tablets" below. 



 4.      Many women have spotting or light bleeding at unexpected times, or may feel sick to their stomach during the first 1 to 3 packs of tablets. 



 If you do have spotting or light bleeding or feel sick to your stomach, do not stop taking the tablets. The problem will usually go away. If it does not go away, check with your healthcare provider.



 5.      Missing tablets can also cause spotting or light bleeding, even when you make up these missed tablets.



 On the days you take two tablets, to make up for missed tablets, you could also feel a little sick to your stomach. 



 6.      If you have vomiting (within 3 to 4 hours after you take your tablet), you should follow the instructions for "What to Do if You Miss Tablets". If you have diarrhea or if you take certain medicines, including some antibiotics and some herbal products such as St. John's Wort, your tablets may not work as well.



 Use a back-up method (such as condoms and spermicides) until you check with your healthcare provider.



 7.   If you have trouble remembering to take Mibelas 24 Fe, talk to your healthcare provider about how to make tablet-taking easier or about using another method of birth control. 



   8.   If you have any questions or are unsure about the information in this leaflet, call your healthcare provider.   



     Before You Start Taking Your Mibelas 24 Fe Tablets  



 1.   Decide What Time of Day You Want to Take Your Tablet. It is important to take Mibelas 24 Fe tablets in the order directed on the package at the same time every day. Mibelas 24 Fe can be taken without regard to meals. 



 2.   Look at Your Wallet Pack - It has 28 Tablets 



 The Mibelas 24 Fe pack has   24 "active" white tablets   (with hormones) to be taken for 24 days, followed by   4 "reminder" brown tablets   (without hormones) to be taken for the next four days. 



 3.      Also look for:



 a) Where on the pack to start taking tablets,



 b) In what order to take the tablets (follow the arrows shown in the picture above)



 c) The week numbers as shown in the picture above.



 4.      Be sure you have ready at all times



 a)   another kind of birth control (such as a condoms and spermicide) to use as a back-up in case you miss tablets, and 



 b)   an extra, full tablet pack.



   When to Start the First Pack of Tablets   



 You have a choice for which day to start taking your first pack of tablets. Decide with your healthcare provider which is the best day for you. Pick a time of day which will be easy to remember.



 Day 1 Start: 



 *  Pick the day label strip that starts with the first day of your period (this is the day you start bleeding or spotting, even if it is almost midnight when the bleeding begins). 
 *  Place this day label strip on the wallet over the area that has the days of the week (starting with Sunday) printed on the plastic. 
 *  Take the first white tablet of the pack during the first 24 hours of your period. 
 *  You will not need to use a back-up method of birth control, since you are starting the tablet at the beginning of your period. However, if you start Mibelas 24 Fe later than the first day of your period, you should use another method of birth control (such as a condom and spermicide) as a back-up method until you have taken 7 white tablets. 
    Sunday Start: 
 

 *  Take the first white tablet of the pack on the Sunday after your period starts, even if you are still bleeding. If your period begins on Sunday, start the pack that same day. 
 *  Use another method of birth control (such as a condom and spermicide) as a back-up method if you have sex anytime from the Sunday you start your first pack until the next Sunday (7 days). This also applies if you start Mibelas 24 Fe after having been pregnant, and you have not had a period since your pregnancy. 
      When You Switch From a Different Birth Control Tablet or Capsule  
 

 When switching from another birth control pill, finish all the tablets or capsules, then Mibelas 24 Fe should be started on the same day that a new pack of the previous birth control tablet or capsule would have been started. 



   When You Switch From Another Type of Birth Control Method  



 When switching from a transdermal patch or vaginal ring, finish the 21 days of use, wait 7 days, then Mibelas 24 Fe should be started when the next application would have been due. When switching from an injection, Mibelas 24 Fe should be started when the next injection would have been due. When switching from an intrauterine device or an implant, Mibelas 24 Fe should be started on the day of removal.



   What to Do During the Month  



 1.      Take one tablet at the same time every day until the pack is empty. 



 Do not skip tablets even if you are spotting or bleeding between monthly periods or feel sick to your stomach (nausea). 



 2.   Do not skip tablets even if you do not have sex very often. 



 When you finish a pack of tablets, start the next pack on the day after your last brown tablet. Do not wait any days between packs.



   What to Do if You Miss Tablets  



 Mibelas 24 Fe may not be as effective if you miss any white tablets, especially if you miss the first few or the last few white tablets in a pack.



   If you miss 1 white tablet:   



 *  Take the tablet as soon as you remember. Take the next tablet at your regular time. This means you may take two tablets in one day. 
 *  You do not need to use a back-up birth control method if you have sex. 
      If you miss 2 white tablets in a row in week 1 OR week 2 of your pack:   
 

 *  Take two tablets on the day you remember and two tablets the next day. 
 *  Then take one tablet a day until you finish the pack. 
 *  You could become pregnant if you have sex in the 7 days after you restart your tablets. You must use another birth control method (such as a condom and spermicide) as a back-up for those 7 days. 
      If you miss 2 white tablets in a row in week 3 or week 4 of your pack:   
 

 1.        If you are a Day 1 Starter:   



 Throw out the rest of the tablet pack and start a new pack that same day.



   If you are a Sunday Starter:   



 Keep taking one tablet every day until Sunday. On Sunday, throw out the rest of the pack and start a new pack of tablets that same day. 



 2.        You could become pregnant   if you have sex in the 7 days after you restart your tablets. You must use another birth control method (such as a condom and spermicide) as a back-up for those 7 days. 



 3.      You may not have your period this month but this is expected.   However, if you miss your period two months in a row, call your healthcare provider because you might be pregnant.   



   If you miss 3 or more white tablets in a row during any week:   



 1.        If you are a Day 1 Starter:   



 Throw out the rest of the tablet pack and start a new pack that same day. 



   If you are a Sunday Starter:   



 Keep taking 1 tablet every day until Sunday. On Sunday, throw out the rest of the pack and start a new pack of tablets that same day. 



 2.     You could become pregnant   if you have sex on the days when you missed tablets or during the first 7 days after you restart your tablets. You must use another birth control method (such as a condom and spermicide) as a back-up the next time you have sex and for the first 7 days after you restart your tablets. 



 3.   You may not have your period this month but this is expected.   However, if you miss your period two months in a row, call your healthcare provider because you might be pregnant.   



   If you miss any of the 4 brown tablets in Week 4:   



 *  Throw away the tablets you missed. 
 *  Keep taking one tablet each day until the pack is empty. 
 *  You do not need a back-up method. 
 *  Start the next pack of Mibelas 24 Fe as scheduled. 
      Finally, if you are still not sure what to do about the tablets you have missed:   
 

 *  Use a back-up method (such as a condom and spermicide) anytime you have sex. 
 *  Contact your healthcare provider and continue taking one active white tablet each day until otherwise directed. 
      Who should not take Mibelas 24 Fe?   
 

 Your healthcare provider will not give you Mibelas 24 Fe if you have: 



 *  Ever had blood clots in your arms, legs (deep vein thrombosis), lungs (pulmonary embolism), or eyes (retinal thrombosis) 
 *  Ever had a stroke 
 *  Ever had a heart attack 
 *  Certain heart valve problems or heart rhythm abnormalities that can cause blood clots to form in the heart 
 *  An inherited problem with your blood that makes it clot more than normal 
 *  High blood pressure that medicine cannot control 
 *  Diabetes with kidney, eye, nerve, or blood vessel damage 
 *  Ever had certain kinds of severe migraine headaches with aura, numbness, weakness or changes in vision, or have any migraine headache if you are over age 35. 
 *  Ever had breast cancer or any cancer that is sensitive to female hormones 
 *  Liver disease, including liver tumors 
 *  Take any Hepatitis C drug combination containing ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir. This may increase levels of the liver enzyme "alanine aminotransferase" (ALT) in the blood 
    Also, do not take birth control pills if you: 
 

 *  Smoke and are over 35 years old 
 *  Are or suspect you are pregnant 
 *  Have any unexplained bleeding from the vagina 
    Birth control pills may not be a good choice for you if you have ever had jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes) caused by pregnancy, also called cholestasis of pregnancy. 
 

 Tell your healthcare provider if you have ever had any of the above conditions (your healthcare provider may recommend another method of birth control).



   What else should I know about taking Mibelas 24 Fe?   



 Birth control pills do       not       protect you against any sexually transmitted infection, including HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. 



 Do not skip any tablets, even if you do not have sex often.



   If you miss a period, you could be pregnant.   However, some women miss periods or have light periods on birth control pills, even when they are not pregnant. Contact your healthcare provider for advice if you: 



 *  Think you are pregnant 
 *  Miss one period and have not taken your birth control pills every day 
 *  Miss two periods in a row 
    Birth control pills should not be taken during pregnancy. However, birth control pills taken by accident during pregnancy are not known to cause birth defects. 
 

 You should stop Mibelas 24 Fe at least four weeks before you have surgery and not restart it until at least two weeks after the surgery, due to an increased risk of blood clots.



 If you are breastfeeding, consider another birth control method until you are ready to stop breastfeeding. Birth control pills that contain estrogen, like Mibelas 24 Fe, may decrease the amount of milk you make. A small amount of the pill's hormones passes into breast milk. 



 Tell your healthcare provider about all medicines and herbal products that you take. Some medicines and herbal products may make birth control pills less effective, including:



 *  barbiturates 
 *  bosentan 
 *  carbamazepine 
 *  felbamate 
 *  griseofulvin 
 *  oxcarbazepine 
 *  phenytoin 
 *  rifampin 
 *  St. John's wort 
 *  topiramate 
    Use a back-up or alternative birth control method when you take medicines that may make birth control pills less effective. 
 

 Birth control pills may interact with lamotrigine, an anticonvulsant used for epilepsy. This may increase the risk of seizures, so your healthcare provider may need to adjust the dose of lamotrigine. 



 If you have vomiting or diarrhea, your birth control pills may not work as well. Use another birth control method, like a condom and spermicide, until you check with your healthcare provider. 



 Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone.



 If you are scheduled for any laboratory tests, tell your healthcare provider that you are taking birth control pills. Certain blood tests may be affected by birth control pills.



   What are the most serious risks of taking Mibelas 24 Fe?   



 Like pregnancy, birth control pills increase the risk of serious blood clots, especially in women who have other risk factors, such as smoking, obesity, or age greater than 35. This increased risk is highest when you first start taking birth control pills and when you restart the same or different birth control pills after not using them for a month or more.



 It is possible to die from a problem caused by a blood clot, such as a heart attack or a stroke. 



 Some examples of serious blood clots are blood clots in the: 



 *  Legs (deep vein thrombosis) 
 *  Lungs (pulmonary embolus) 
 *  Eyes (loss of eyesight) 
 *  Heart (heart attack) 
 *  Brain (stroke) 
    Women who take birth control pills may get: 
 

 *  High blood pressure 
 *  Gallbladder problems 
 *  Rare cancerous or noncancerous liver tumors 
    All of these events are uncommon in healthy women. 
 

   Call your healthcare provider right away if you have:   



 *  Persistent leg pain 
 *  Sudden shortness of breath 
 *  Sudden blindness, partial or complete 
 *  Severe pain or pressure in your chest 
 *  Sudden, severe headache unlike your usual headaches 
 *  Weakness or numbness in an arm or leg, or trouble speaking 
 *  Yellowing of the skin or eyeballs 
      What are the common side effects of birth control pills?   
 

 The most common side effects of birth control pills are: 



 *  Spotting or bleeding between menstrual periods 
 *  Nausea 
 *  Breast tenderness 
 *  Headache 
    These side effects are usually mild and usually disappear with time. 
 

 Less common side effects are: 



 *  Acne 
 *  Less sexual desire 
 *  Bloating or fluid retention 
 *  Blotchy darkening of the skin, especially on the face 
 *  High blood sugar, especially in women who already have diabetes 
 *  High fat (cholesterol, triglyceride) levels in the blood 
 *  Depression, especially if you have had depression in the past. Call your healthcare provider immediately if you have any thoughts of harming yourself 
 *  Problems tolerating contact lenses 
 *  Weight gain 
    This is not a complete list of possible side effects. Talk to your healthcare provider if you develop any side effects that concern you. You may report side effects to the FDA at   1-800-FDA-1088. 
 

 No serious problems have been reported from a birth control pill overdose, even when accidentally taken by children.



   Do birth control pills cause cancer?   



 Birth control pills do not seem to cause breast cancer. However, if you have breast cancer now, or have had it in the past, do not use birth control pills because some breast cancers are sensitive to hormones. 



 Women who use birth control pills may have a slightly higher chance of getting cervical cancer. However, this may be due to other reasons such as having more sexual partners.



   What should I know about my period when taking Mibelas 24 Fe?   



 Irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting may occur while you are taking Mibelas 24 Fe. Irregular bleeding may vary from slight staining between menstrual periods to breakthrough bleeding, which is a flow much like a regular period. Irregular bleeding occurs most often during the first few months of oral contraceptive use, but may also occur after you have been taking the pill for some time. Such bleeding may be temporary and usually does not indicate any serious problems. It is important to continue taking your tablets on schedule. If the bleeding occurs in more than one cycle, is unusually heavy, or lasts for more than a few days, call your healthcare provider.



 Some women may not have a menstrual period but this should not be cause for alarm as long as you have taken the tablets according to direction.



   What if I miss my scheduled period when taking Mibelas 24 Fe?   



 It is not uncommon to miss your period. However, if you go two or more months in a row without a period, or you miss your period after a month where you did not take all your tablets correctly, call your healthcare provider because you may be pregnant. Also notify your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of pregnancy such as morning sickness or unusual breast tenderness. Stop taking Mibelas 24 Fe if you are pregnant.



   What if I want to become pregnant?  



 You may stop taking the tablets whenever you wish. Consider a visit with your healthcare provider for a pre-pregnancy checkup before you stop taking the tablets.



   General Advice about Mibelas 24 Fe  



 Your healthcare provider prescribed Mibelas 24 Fe for you. Please do not share Mibelas 24 Fe with anyone else. Keep Mibelas 24 Fe out of the reach of children.

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Vascular risks: Stop Mibelas 24 Fe if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding (  5.1  ) 
 *  Liver disease: Discontinue if jaundice occurs (  5.2  ) 
 *  High blood pressure: Do not prescribe for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease (  5.3  ) 
 *  Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking Mibelas 24 Fe. Consider an alternative contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia (  5.5  ) 
 *  Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue if indicated (  5.6  ) 
 *  Uterine bleeding: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea (  5.7  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems



  Stop Mibelas 24 Fe if an arterial or deep venous thrombotic event (VTE) occurs. Stop Mibelas 24 Fe if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately.



 If feasible, stop Mibelas 24 Fe at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of VTE.



 Start Mibelas 24 Fe no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum VTE decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week.



 The use of COCs increases the risk of VTE. However, pregnancy increases the risk of VTE as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of VTE in women using COCs is 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of a COC. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued.



 Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest in older (greater than 35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with underlying risk factors.



 Use COCs with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors.



    5.2 Liver Disease



    Impaired Liver Function    



 Do not use Mibelas 24 Fe in women with acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of the liver [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (  4)  ].  Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Discontinue Mibelas 24 Fe if jaundice develops.



   Liver Tumors    



 Mibelas 24 Fe is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (  4  )].  Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases per 100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage.



 Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (greater than 8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users.



     5.3 Risk of Liver Enzyme Elevations with Concomitant Hepatitis C Treatment  



   During clinical trials with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen that contains ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, ALT elevations greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN),including some cases greater than 20 times the ULN, were significantly more frequent in women using ethinyl estradiol-containing medications, such as COCs. Discontinue Minastrin 24 Fe prior to starting therapy with the combination drug regimen ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir [see Contraindications (  4  )]. Minastrin 24 Fe can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen.  



    5.4 High Blood Pressure



  Mibelas 24 Fe is contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (  4  )]   .  For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Mibelas 24 Fe if blood pressure rises significantly.



 An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestin.



    5.5 Gallbladder Disease



  Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. Use of COCs may also worsen existing gallbladder disease.



 A past history of COC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use. Women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC-related cholestasis.  



    5.6 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects



  Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking Mibelas 24 Fe. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion.



 Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs.



 Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs.



    5.7 Headache



  If a woman taking Mibelas 24 Fe develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Mibelas 24 Fe if indicated.



 Consider discontinuation of Mibelas 24 Fe in the case of increased frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (  4  )].  



    5.8 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea



    Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting    



 Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC.



 Based on patient diaries from a clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of a 24-day regimen of norethindrone acetate 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 0.020 mg tablets, 24 to 35% of women experienced unscheduled bleeding per cycle. A total of 10 subjects out of 743 (1.3%) discontinued due to bleeding or spotting.



   Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea    



 Women who are not pregnant and use norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ferrous fumarate tablets may experience amenorrhea. In the clinical trial with a 24-day regimen of norethindrone acetate 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 0.020 mg tablets and ferrous fumarate tablets, 22 to 36% of the women using norethindrone acetate 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 0.020 mg tablets and ferrous fumarate tablets experienced amenorrhea in at least one of 6 cycles of use. Some women may experience post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was preexistent.



 If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.   



    5.9 COC Use before or during Early Pregnancy



  Extensive epidemiologic studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned, when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Discontinue Mibelas 24 Fe if pregnancy is confirmed.



 Administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (  8.1  )].    



    5.10 Depression



  Carefully observe women with a history of depression and discontinue Mibelas 24 Fe if depression recurs to a serious degree.  



    5.11 Carcinoma of the Breast and Cervix



  Mibelas 24 Fe is contraindicated in women who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally-sensitive [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (  4  )].  



 There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings.



 Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors.   



    5.12 Effect on Binding Globulins



  The estrogen component of COCs may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, sex hormone-binding globulin, and cortisol-binding globulin. The dose of replacement thyroid hormones or cortisol therapy may need to be increased.   



    5.13 Monitoring



  A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare.  



    5.14 Hereditary Angioedema



  In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema.  



    5.15 Chloasma



  Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking Mibelas 24 Fe.
