  6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The safety of ALUNBRIG was evaluated in 219 patients with locally advanced or metastatic ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who received at least one dose of ALUNBRIG in ALTA after experiencing disease progression on crizotinib. Patients received ALUNBRIG 90 mg once daily continuously (90 mg group) or 90 mg once daily for 7 days followed by 180 mg once daily (90-&gt;180 mg group). The median duration of treatment was 7.5 months in the 90 mg group and 7.8 months in the 90-&gt;180 mg group. A total of 150 (68%) patients were exposed to ALUNBRIG for greater than or equal to 6 months and 42 (19%) patients were exposed for greater than or equal to one year.



 The study population characteristics were: median age 54 years (range: 18 to 82), age less than 65 years (77%), female (57%), White (67%), Asian (31%), Stage IV disease (98%), NSCLC adenocarcinoma histology (97%), never or former smoker (95%), ECOG Performance Status (PS) 0 or 1 (93%), and brain metastases at baseline (69%)  [see  Clinical Studies (14)  ]  .



 Serious adverse reactions occurred in 38% of patients in the 90 mg group and 40% of patients in the 90-&gt;180 mg group. The most common serious adverse reactions were pneumonia (5.5% overall, 3.7% in the 90 mg group, and 7.3% in the 90-&gt;180 mg group) and ILD/pneumonitis (4.6% overall, 1.8% in the 90 mg group and 7.3% in the 90-&gt;180 mg group). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 3.7% of patients and consisted of pneumonia (2 patients), sudden death, dyspnea, respiratory failure, pulmonary embolism, bacterial meningitis and urosepsis (1 patient each).



 In ALTA, 2.8% of patients in the 90 mg group and 8.2% of patients in the 90-&gt;180 mg group permanently discontinued ALUNBRIG for adverse reactions. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to discontinuation were ILD/pneumonitis (0.9% in the 90 mg group and 1.8% in the 90-&gt;180 mg group) and pneumonia (1.8% in the 90-&gt;180 mg group only).



 In ALTA, 14% of patients required a dose reduction due to adverse reactions (7.3% in the 90 mg group and 20% in the 90-&gt;180 mg group). The most common adverse reaction that led to dose reduction was increased creatine phosphokinase for both regimens (1.8% in the 90 mg group and 4.5% in the 90-&gt;180 mg group).



 Table 3 and Table 4 summarize the common adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities observed in ALTA.

 *   Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use a non-hormonal method of effective contraception. (  5.8  ,  8.1  ,  8.3  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis



  Severe, life-threatening, and fatal pulmonary adverse reactions consistent with interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis have occurred with ALUNBRIG.



 In Trial ALTA (ALTA), ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 3.7% of patients in the 90 mg group (90 mg once daily) and 9.1% of patients in the 90-&gt;180 mg group (180 mg once daily with 7-day lead-in at 90 mg once daily).



 Adverse reactions consistent with possible ILD/pneumonitis occurred early (within 9 days of initiation of ALUNBRIG; median onset was 2 days) in 6.4% of patients, with Grade 3 to 4 reactions occurring in 2.7%.



 Monitor for new or worsening respiratory symptoms (e.g., dyspnea, cough, etc.), particularly during the first week of initiating ALUNBRIG. Withhold ALUNBRIG in any patient with new or worsening respiratory symptoms, and promptly evaluate for ILD/pneumonitis or other causes of respiratory symptoms (e.g., pulmonary embolism, tumor progression, and infectious pneumonia). For Grade 1 or 2 ILD/pneumonitis, either resume ALUNBRIG with dose reduction according to Table 1 after recovery to baseline or permanently discontinue ALUNBRIG. Permanently discontinue ALUNBRIG for Grade 3 or 4 ILD/pneumonitis or recurrence of Grade 1 or 2 ILD/pneumonitis [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



    5.2 Hypertension



  In ALTA, hypertension was reported in 11% of patients in the 90 mg group who received ALUNBRIG and 21% of patients in the 90-&gt;180 mg group. Grade 3 hypertension occurred in 5.9% of patients overall.



 Control blood pressure prior to treatment with ALUNBRIG. Monitor blood pressure after 2 weeks and at least monthly thereafter during treatment with ALUNBRIG. Withhold ALUNBRIG for Grade 3 hypertension despite optimal antihypertensive therapy. Upon resolution or improvement to Grade 1 severity, resume ALUNBRIG at a reduced dose. Consider permanent discontinuation of treatment with ALUNBRIG for Grade 4 hypertension or recurrence of Grade 3 hypertension [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  



 Use caution when administering ALUNBRIG in combination with antihypertensive agents that cause bradycardia [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  .



    5.3 Bradycardia



  Bradycardia can occur with ALUNBRIG. In ALTA, heart rates less than 50 beats per minute (bpm) occurred in 5.7% of patients in the 90 mg group and 7.6% of patients in the 90-&gt;180 mg group. Grade 2 bradycardia occurred in 1 (0.9%) patient in the 90 mg group.



 Monitor heart rate and blood pressure during treatment with ALUNBRIG. Monitor patients more frequently if concomitant use of drug known to cause bradycardia cannot be avoided [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]  .



 For symptomatic bradycardia, withhold ALUNBRIG and review concomitant medications for those known to cause bradycardia. If a concomitant medication known to cause bradycardia is identified and discontinued or dose adjusted, resume ALUNBRIG at the same dose following resolution of symptomatic bradycardia; otherwise, reduce the dose of ALUNBRIG following resolution of symptomatic bradycardia. Discontinue ALUNBRIG for life-threatening bradycardia if no contributing concomitant medication is identified [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ].  



    5.4 Visual Disturbance



  In ALTA, adverse reactions leading to visual disturbance including blurred vision, diplopia, and reduced visual acuity, were reported in 7.3% of patients receiving ALUNBRIG in the 90 mg group and 10% of patients in the 90-&gt;180 mg group. Grade 3 macular edema and cataract occurred in one patient each in the 90-&gt;180 mg group.



 Advise patients to report any visual symptoms. Withhold ALUNBRIG and obtain an ophthalmologic evaluation in patients with new or worsening visual symptoms of Grade 2 or greater severity. Upon recovery of Grade 2 or Grade 3 visual disturbances to Grade 1 severity or baseline, resume ALUNBRIG at a reduced dose. Permanently discontinue treatment with ALUNBRIG for Grade 4 visual disturbances [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  



    5.5 Creatine Phosphokinase (CPK) Elevation



  In ALTA, creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevation occurred in 27% of patients receiving ALUNBRIG in the 90 mg group and 48% of patients in the 90 mg-&gt;180 mg group. The incidence of Grade 3-4 CPK elevation was 2.8% in the 90 mg group and 12% in the 90-&gt;180 mg group.



 Dose reduction for CPK elevation occurred in 1.8% of patients in the 90 mg group and 4.5% in the 90-&gt;180 mg group.



 Advise patients to report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness. Monitor CPK levels during ALUNBRIG treatment. Withhold ALUNBRIG for Grade 3 or 4 CPK elevation. Upon resolution or recovery to Grade 1 or baseline, resume ALUNBRIG at the same dose or at a reduced dose as described in Table 2 [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



    5.6 Pancreatic Enzyme Elevation



  In ALTA, amylase elevation occurred in 27% of patients in the 90 mg group and 39% of patients in the 90-&gt;180 mg group. Lipase elevations occurred in 21% of patients in the 90 mg group and 45% of patients in the 90-&gt;180 mg group. Grade 3 or 4 amylase elevation occurred in 3.7% of patients in the 90 mg group and 2.7% of patients in the 90-&gt;180 mg group. Grade 3 or 4 lipase elevation occurred in 4.6% of patients in the 90 mg group and 5.5% of patients in the 90-&gt;180 mg group.



 Monitor lipase and amylase during treatment with ALUNBRIG. Withhold ALUNBRIG for Grade 3 or 4 pancreatic enzyme elevation. Upon resolution or recovery to Grade 1 or baseline, resume ALUNBRIG at the same dose or at a reduced dose as described in Table 2 [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  



    5.7 Hyperglycemia



  In ALTA, 43% of patients who received ALUNBRIG experienced new or worsening hyperglycemia. Grade 3 hyperglycemia, based on laboratory assessment of serum fasting glucose levels, occurred in 3.7% of patients. Two of 20 (10%) patients with diabetes or glucose intolerance at baseline required initiation of insulin while receiving ALUNBRIG.



 Assess fasting serum glucose prior to initiation of ALUNBRIG and monitor periodically thereafter. Initiate or optimize anti-hyperglycemic medications as needed. If adequate hyperglycemic control cannot be achieved with optimal medical management, withhold ALUNBRIG until adequate hyperglycemic control is achieved and consider reducing the dose of ALUNBRIG as described in Table 1 or permanently discontinuing ALUNBRIG [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



    5.8 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, ALUNBRIG can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. There are no clinical data on the use of ALUNBRIG in pregnant women. Administration of brigatinib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in dose-related skeletal anomalies at doses as low as 12.5 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.7 times the human exposure by AUC at 180 mg once daily) as well as increased post implantation loss, malformations, and decreased fetal body weight at doses of 25 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.26 times the human exposure at 180 mg once daily) or higher.



 Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective non-hormonal contraception during treatment with ALUNBRIG and for at least 4 months following the final dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 3 months after the last dose of ALUNBRIG [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1  and  8.3)  and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)  ].
