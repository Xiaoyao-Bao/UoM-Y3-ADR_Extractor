   General



    *  The contents of this kit are not radioactive. However, after sodium pertechnetate Tc 99m is added, adequate shielding of the final preparation must be maintained. 
 *  Contents of the reaction vial are intended only for use in the preparation of technetium Tc 99m mertiatide and are NOT to be administered directly to the patient. 
 *  To help reduce the radiation dose to the bladder, as well as other target organs, the patient should increase his or her fluid intake (unless medically contraindicated) and void as often as possible after the injection of technetium Tc 99m mertiatide for six hours after the imaging procedure. 
 *  Technetium Tc 99m mertiatide should not be used more than six hours after preparation. 
 *  The components of the kit are sterile and nonpyrogenic. It is essential that the user follow the directions carefully and use aseptic procedures normally employed in making additions and withdrawals from sterile, nonpyrogenic containers during the addition of pertechnetate solution and the withdrawal of doses for patient administration. 
 *  The technetium Tc 99m labeling reactions involved in preparing Technescan MAG3 depend on maintaining the stannous ion in the reduced state. Any oxidant present in the sodium pertechnetate Tc 99m may adversely affect the quality of the radiopharmaceutical. Therefore, sodium pertechnetate Tc 99m containing oxidants should not be employed. 
 *  As in the use of any other radioactive material, care should be taken to ensure minimum radiation exposure to the patient and to occupational workers. 
 *  Radiopharmaceuticals should be used only by physicians who are qualified by specific training in the safe use and handling of radionuclides. 
       Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility
 

  No long term animal studies have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic or mutagenic potential, or whether this drug affects fertility in males or females.



    Pregnancy



  Pregnancy Category C.



 Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with technetium Tc 99m mertiatide. It is also not known whether this drug can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Technetium Tc 99m mertiatide should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.



    Nursing Mothers



  Technetium Tc 99m is excreted in human milk during lactation, therefore, formula feedings should be substituted for breast feeding.



    Pediatric Use



  Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients under the age of 30 days have not been established.
