  6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     Trial 1  



 The data described below reflect exposure to POTELIGEO in a randomized, open-label, actively controlled clinical trial for adult patients with MF or SS who received at least one prior systemic therapy [  see  Clinical Studies (14)    ]. Of 370 patients treated, 184 (57% with MF, 43% with SS) received POTELIGEO as randomized treatment and 186 (53% with MF, 47% with SS) received vorinostat. In the vorinostat arm, 135 patients (73%) subsequently crossed over to POTELIGEO for a total of 319 patients treated with POTELIGEO.



 POTELIGEO was administered at 1 mg/kg intravenously over at least 60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of the first 28-day cycle and on days 1 and 15 of subsequent 28-day cycles. Premedication (diphenhydramine, acetaminophen) was optional and administered to 65% of randomized patients for the first infusion. The comparator group received vorinostat 400 mg orally once daily, given continuously in 28-day cycles. Treatment continued until unacceptable toxicity or progressive disease.



 The median age was 64 years (range, 25 to 101 years), 58% of patients were male, 70% were white, and 99% had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. Patients had a median of 3 prior systemic therapies. The trial required an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;=1500/uL (&gt;=1000/uL if bone marrow was involved), platelet count &gt;=100,000/uL (&gt;=75,000/uL if bone marrow was involved), creatinine clearance &gt;50 mL/min or serum creatinine &lt;=1.5 mg/dL, and hepatic transaminases &lt;=2.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (&lt;=5 times ULN if lymphomatous liver infiltration). Patients with active autoimmune disease, active infection, autologous HSCT within 90 days, or prior allogeneic HSCT were excluded.



 During randomized treatment, the median duration of exposure to POTELIGEO was 5.6 months, with 48% (89/184) of patients with at least 6 months of exposure and 23% (43/184) with at least 12 months of exposure. The median duration of exposure to vorinostat was 2.8 months, with 22% (41/186) of patients with at least 6 months of exposure.



 Fatal adverse reactions within 90 days of the last dose occurred in 2.2% (7/319) of patients who received POTELIGEO as randomized or crossover treatment.



 Serious adverse reactions were reported in 36% (66/184) of patients randomized to POTELIGEO and most often involved infection (16% of patients; 30/184). Serious adverse reactions reported in &gt;2% of patients randomized to POTELIGEO were pneumonia (5%), sepsis (4%), pyrexia (4%), and skin infection (3%); other serious adverse reactions, each reported in 2% of patients, included hepatitis, pneumonitis, rash, infusion related reaction, lower respiratory tract infection, and renal insufficiency. POTELIGEO was discontinued for adverse reactions in 18% of randomized patients, most often due to rash or drug eruption (7.1%).



     Common Adverse Reactions  



 The most common adverse reactions (reported in &gt;=20% of patients randomized to POTELIGEO) were rash (including drug eruption), infusion related reactions, fatigue, diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection and musculoskeletal pain. Other common adverse reactions (reported in &gt;=10% of patients randomized to POTELIGEO) included skin infection, pyrexia, nausea, edema, thrombocytopenia, headache, constipation, mucositis, anemia, cough and hypertension. Table 1 summarizes common adverse reactions having a &gt;=2% higher incidence with POTELIGEO than with vorinostat in Trial 1.

   6.2 Immunogenicity

  As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of incidence of antibodies to POTELIGEO with the incidences of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading.



 Among 258 patients treated with POTELIGEO in Trial 1, 10 (3.9%) tested positive for treatment-emergent (treatment-induced or treatment-boosted) anti-mogamulizumab-kpkc antibodies by an electrochemiluminescent assay. There were no positive neutralizing antibody responses.



   6.3 Postmarketing Safety Information

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of POTELIGEO. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 *  Infections: Hepatitis B virus reactivation 
 *  Cardiac disorders: Stress cardiomyopathy

   5.1 Dermatologic Toxicity



  Fatal and life-threatening skin adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), have occurred in recipients of POTELIGEO. Rash (drug eruption) is one of the most common adverse reactions associated with POTELIGEO. In Trial 1, 25% (80/319) of patients treated with POTELIGEO had an adverse reaction of drug eruption, with 18% of these cases being severe (Grade 3) and 82% of these cases being Grade 1 or 2. Of 528 patients treated with POTELIGEO in clinical trials, Grade 3 skin adverse reactions were reported in 3.6%, Grade 4 skin adverse reactions in &lt;1%, and SJS in &lt;1%.



 The onset of drug eruption is variable, and the affected areas and appearance vary. In Trial 1, the median time to onset was 15 weeks, with 25% of cases occurring after 31 weeks. The more common presentations reported included papular or maculopapular rash, lichenoid, spongiotic or granulomatous dermatitis, and morbilliform rash. Other presentations included scaly plaques, pustular eruption, folliculitis, non-specific dermatitis, and psoriasiform dermatitis.



 Monitor patients for rash throughout the treatment course. Management of dermatologic toxicity includes topical corticosteroids and interruption or permanent cessation of POTELIGEO [ see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)    ]. Consider skin biopsy to help distinguish drug eruption from disease progression.



 Discontinue POTELIGEO permanently for SJS or TEN or for any life-threatening (Grade 4) reaction. For possible SJS or TEN, interrupt POTELIGEO and do not restart unless SJS or TEN is ruled out and the cutaneous reaction has resolved to Grade 1 or less.



    5.2 Infusion Reactions



  Fatal and life-threatening infusion reactions have been reported in patients treated with POTELIGEO. In Trial 1, infusion reactions occurred in 35% (112/319) of patients treated with POTELIGEO, with 8% of these reactions being severe (Grade 3). Most reactions (approximately 90%) occur during or shortly after the first infusion. Infusion reactions can also occur with subsequent infusions. The most commonly reported signs include chills, nausea, fever, tachycardia, rigors, headache, and vomiting.



 Consider premedication (such as diphenhydramine and acetaminophen) for the first infusion of POTELIGEO in all patients. Whether premedication reduces the risk or severity of these reactions is not established. In Trial 1, infusion reactions occurred in 42% of patients without premedication and 32% of patients with premedication. Monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of infusion reactions and interrupt the infusion for any grade reaction and treat promptly [ see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)    ].



    5.3 Infections



  Fatal and life-threatening infections have occurred in patients treated with POTELIGEO, including sepsis, pneumonia, and skin infection. In Trial 1, 18% (34/184) of patients randomized to POTELIGEO had Grade 3 or higher infection or an infection-related serious adverse reaction. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection and treat promptly.



    5.4 Autoimmune Complications



  Fatal and life-threatening immune-mediated complications have been reported in recipients of POTELIGEO. Grade 3 or higher immune-mediated or possibly immune-mediated reactions have included myositis, myocarditis, polymyositis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and a variant of Guillain-Barre syndrome. Use of systemic immunosuppressants for immune-mediated reactions was reported in 1.9% (6/319) of recipients of POTELIGEO in Trial 1, including for a case of Grade 2 polymyalgia rheumatica. New-onset hypothyroidism (Grade 1 or 2) was reported in 1.3% of patients and managed with observation or levothyroxine. Interrupt or permanently discontinue POTELIGEO as appropriate for suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions. Consider the benefit/risk of POTELIGEO in patients with a history of autoimmune disease.



    5.5 Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) after POTELIGEO



  Increased risks of transplant complications have been reported in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT after POTELIGEO including severe (Grade 3 or 4) acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), steroid-refractory GVHD, and transplant-related death. Among recipients of pre-transplantation POTELIGEO, a higher risk of transplant complications has been reported if POTELIGEO is given within a shorter time frame (approximately 50 days) before HSCT. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications.
