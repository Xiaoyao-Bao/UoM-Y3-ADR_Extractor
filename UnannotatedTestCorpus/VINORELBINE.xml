  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under varying designs and in different patient populations, the adverse reaction rates reported in one clinical trial may not be easily compared to those rates reported in another clinical trial, and may not reflect the rates actually observed in clinical practice.



   Single Agent  



 The data below reflect exposure to Vinorelbine as a single agent administered at a dose of 30 mg/m  2  on a weekly basis to 365 patients enrolled in 3 controlled studies for metastatic NSCLC and advanced breast cancer. The population included 143 previously untreated metastatic NSCLC patients (Study 3) who received a median of 8 doses of Vinorelbine. The patients were aged 32 to 79 (median 61 years), 71% were male, 91% Caucasian, 48% had adenocarcinoma histology. The data also reflect exposure to Vinorelbine in 222 patients with previously treated advanced breast cancer who received a median of 10 doses of Vinorelbine. Vinorelbine is not indicated for the treatment of breast cancer.



 Selected adverse reactions reported in these studies are provided in Tables  1  and  2  . The most common adverse reactions (&gt;= 20%) of single agent Vinorelbine were leukopenia, neutropenia, anemia, Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation, nausea, vomiting, constipation, asthenia, injection site reaction, and peripheral neuropathy. The most common (&gt;= 5%) Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, increased total bilirubin, AST elevation, injection site reaction and asthenia. Approximately 49% of NSCLC patients treated with Vinorelbine experienced at least one dose reduction due to an adverse reaction. Thirteen percent of patients discontinued Vinorelbine due to adverse reactions. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to Vinorelbine discontinuation were asthenia, dyspnea, nausea, constipation, anorexia, myasthenia and fever.

             Myelosuppression:  In clinical trials, Grade 3-4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia occurred in 69%, 9% and 1%, respectively of patients receiving single-agent Vinorelbine. Neutropenia is the major dose-limiting toxicity.
 

   Neurotoxicity:  neurotoxicity was most commonly manifested as constipation, paresthesia, hypersthesia, and hyporeflexia. Grade 3 and 4 neuropathy was observed in 1% of the patients receiving single-agent Vinorelbine.



   Injection site reactions:  Injection site reactions, including erythema, pain at injection site, and vein discoloration, occurred in approximately one third of patients; 5% were severe. Phlebitis (chemical phlebitis) along the vein proximal to the site of injection was reported in 10% of patients.



   Cardiovascular toxicity:  Chest pain occurred in 5% of patients; myocardial infarction occurred in less than 0.1% of patients.



   Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure:  Dyspnea (shortness of breath) was reported in 3% of patients; it was severe in 2%. Interstitial pulmonary changes were documented.



   Other:  Hemorrhagic cystitis and the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion were each reported in &lt;1% of patients.



   In Combination with Cisplatin  



   Table 3  presents the incidence of selected adverse reactions, occurring in &gt;= 10% of Vinorelbine treated patients reported in a randomized trial comparing the combination of Vinorelbine 25 mg/m  2  administered every week of each 28-day cycle and cisplatin 100 mg/m  2  administered on Day 1 of each 28-day cycle versus cisplatin alone at the same dose and schedule in patients with previously untreated NSCLC (Study 1).



 Patients randomized to Vinorelbine plus cisplatin received a median of 3 cycles of treatment and those randomized to cisplatin alone received a median of 2 cycles of treatment. Thirty-Five percent of the eligible patients in the combination arm required treatment discontinuation due to an adverse reaction compared to 19% in the cisplatin alone arm. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia was significantly higher in the Vinorelbine plus cisplatin arm (82%) compared to the cisplatin alone arm (5%). Four patients in the Vinorelbine plus cisplatin arm died of neutropenic sepsis. Seven additional deaths were reported in the combination arm: 2 from cardiac ischemia, 1 cerebrovascular accident, 1 multisystem failure due to an overdose of Vinorelbine, and 3 from febrile neutropenia.

             Table 4  presents the incidence of selected adverse reactions, occurring in &gt;= 10% of Vinorelbine treated patients reported in a randomized trial of Vinorelbine plus cisplatin, vindesine plus cisplatin and Vinorelbine alone in patients with stage III or IV NSCLC who had not received prior chemotherapy. A total of 604 patients received either Vinorelbine 30 mg/m  2  every week plus cisplatin 120 mg/m  2  on Day 1 and Day 29, then every 6 weeks thereafter (N=207), vindesine 3 mg/m  2  for 6 weeks, then every other week thereafter plus cisplatin 120 mg/m  2  on Days 1 and Day 29, then every 6 weeks thereafter (N=193) or Vinorelbine 30 mg/m  2  every week (N=204).
 

 Patients randomized to Vinorelbine plus cisplatin received a median of 15 weeks of treatment, vindesine plus cisplatin 12 weeks and Vinorelbine received 13 weeks. Study discontinuation due to an adverse reaction was required in 27, 22 and 10% of the patients randomized to Vinorelbine plus cisplatin, vindesine plus cisplatin and cisplatin alone arms, respectively. Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia was significantly greater in the Vinorelbine plus cisplatin arm (78%) compared to vindesine plus cisplatin (48%) and Vinorelbine alone (53%).

   5.1 Myelosuppression



  Myelosuppression manifested by neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia occur with Vinorelbine as a single agent and in combination with cisplatin [ see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  and  6.2  )  ]. Neutropenia is the major dose-limiting toxicity with Vinorelbine. Grade 3-4 neutropenia occurred in 53% of patients treated with Vinorelbine at 30 mg/m  2  per week. Dose adjustment due to myelosuppression occurred in 51% of patients (Study 2). In clinical trials with Vinorelbine administered at 30 mg/m  2  per week, neutropenia resulted in hospitalizations for pyrexia and/or sepsis in 8% of patients. Death due to sepsis occurred in 1% of patients. Neutropenia nadirs occur between 7 and 10 days after dosing with neutropenia count recovery usually occurring within the following 7 to 14 days.



 Monitor complete blood counts prior to each dose of Vinorelbine. Do not administer Vinorelbine to patients with neutrophil counts &lt;1,000 cells/mm  3  . Adjustments in the dosage of Vinorelbine should be based on neutrophil counts obtained on the day of treatment [ see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)    ].



    5.2 Hepatic Toxicity



  Drug-induced liver injury manifest by elevations of aspartate aminotransferase and bilirubin can occur in patients receiving Vinorelbine alone or in combination with cytotoxic agents. Assess hepatic function prior to initiation of Vinorelbine and periodically during treatment. Reduce the dose of Vinorelbine for patients who develop elevations in total bilirubin &gt; 2 times upper limit of normal [ see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  and  Use in Specific Populations (8.6)    ].



    5.3 Severe Constipation and Bowel Obstruction



  Severe and fatal paralytic ileus, constipation, intestinal obstruction, necrosis, and perforation occur with Vinorelbine administration. Institute a prophylactic bowel regimen to mitigate potential constipation, bowel obstruction and/or paralytic ileus, considering adequate dietary fiber intake, hydration, and routine use of stool softeners.



    5.4 Extravasation and Tissue Injury



  Extravasation of Vinorelbine can result in severe irritation, local tissue necrosis and/or thrombophlebitis. If signs or symptoms of extravasation occur, immediately stop administration of Vinorelbine and institute recommended management procedures [ see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  and  Adverse Reaction (6.1)    ].



    5.5 Neurologic Toxicity



  Sensory and motor neuropathies, including severe neuropathies, occur in patients receiving Vinorelbine. Monitor patients for new or worsening signs and symptoms of neuropathy such as paresthesia, hyperesthesia, hyporeflexia and muscle weakness while receiving Vinorelbine. Discontinue Vinorelbine for NCI CTCAE Grade 2 or greater neuropathy [ see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  and  Adverse Reaction (6.1)    ].



    5.6 Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure



  Pulmonary toxicity, including severe acute bronchospasm, interstitial pneumonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurs with use of Vinorelbine. Interstitial pneumonitis and ARDS included fatalities. The mean time to onset of interstitial pneumonitis and ARDS after vinorelbine administration was one week (range 3 to 8 days) [ see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ].



 Interrupt Vinorelbine in patients who develop unexplained dyspnea, or have any evidence of pulmonary toxicity. Permanently discontinue Vinorelbine for confirmed interstitial pneumonitis or ARDS.



    5.7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  Vinorelbine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies in mice and rabbits, embryo and fetal toxicity were observed with administration of vinorelbine at doses approximately 0.33 and 0.18 times the human therapeutic dose, respectively. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during therapy with Vinorelbine [ see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  ,  8.7  )  ].
