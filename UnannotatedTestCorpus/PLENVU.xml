  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The safety of PLENVU as a Two-Day Split-Dosing and One-Day Morning Dosing Regimen was evaluated in two randomized, parallel group, multicenter, investigator-blinded clinical trials (Two-Day Split-Dosing in the NOCT and MORA trials and One-Day Morning Dosing in the MORA trial) in 1351 adult patients undergoing colonoscopy. The mean age of the study population was 56 years (range 18 to 86 years), 92% of patients were Caucasian and 51% were female. In the NOCT trial, 61% of patients had mild renal impairment. In the MORA trial, 67% had mild renal impairment and 5% had moderate renal impairment. Patients with severe renal impairment were not enrolled in the clinical trials of PLENVU  [see Clinical Studies (  14  )].  



 The most common adverse reactions (&gt;2%) in the PLENVU treatment groups in both trials were: nausea, vomiting, dehydration and abdominal pain/discomfort.



 Table 1 and Table 2 display adverse reactions reported in at least 1% of patients in one or more treatment group(s) in the NOCT and MORA trials, respectively. Since diarrhea was considered as a part of the efficacy assessment, it was not defined as an adverse reaction in these trials.

            Electrolyte Changes  
 

 Increases in serum sodium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, and urate were noted in more patients treated with PLENVU compared with control in one or both trials. The majority of these changes were transient and not clinically significant. Associated decreases in bicarbonate and increases in serum osmolality were also noted.



   Renal Function  



 Decreases in creatinine clearance and increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were also noted in more patients treated with PLENVU compared to control in both trials. Changes of a magnitude indicative of possible acute renal injury, or worsening of baseline chronic renal impairment, were noted infrequently and occurred at a similar incidence in both PLENVU and comparator arms.



 Adverse reactions in patients with mild renal impairment were similar to those in patients with normal renal function  .  



   Less Common Adverse Reactions  



 Less common adverse reactions (less than 1%) in the NOCT and MORA trials include: anorectal discomfort, hypersensitivity reaction (including rash), migraine, somnolence, asthenia, chills, pains, aches, palpitation, sinus tachycardia, hot flush, and transient increase in liver enzymes.



 An additional 235 patients were exposed to the One-Day Morning Dosing Regimen of PLENVU in a third clinical trial, utilizing a comparator not approved in the United States. The adverse reaction profile for patients receiving PLENVU in that trial was similar to what is described above.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of another oral formulation of polyethylene glycol 3350, sodium ascorbate, sodium sulfate, ascorbic acid, sodium chloride and potassium chloride or other polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based bowel preparations. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Hypersensitivity:  urticaria/rash, pruritus, dermatitis, rhinorrhea dyspnea, chest and throat tightness, fever, angioedema, anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock  [see Contraindications (  4  )]  



   Cardiovascular:  arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, peripheral edema, asystole, and acute pulmonary edema after aspiration



   Gastrointestinal:  upper gastrointestinal bleeding from a Mallory-Weiss tear, esophageal perforation [usually with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)]



   Nervous system:  tremor, seizure
</Section>
    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



  EXCERPT:    Risk of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities:  Encourage adequate hydration, assess concurrent medications, and consider laboratory assessments prior to and after use. (  5.1  ,  5.2  ,  7.1  )



  Cardiac arrhythmias:  Consider pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs in patients at increased risk. (  5.2  )



  Seizures:  Use caution in patients with a history of seizures and patients at increased risk of seizure, including medications that lower the seizure threshold. (  5.3  ,  7.1  )



  Patients with renal impairment or taking concomitant medications that affect renal function:  Use caution, ensure adequate hydration and consider testing. (  5.4  ,  7.1  ,  8.6  )



  Mucosal ulcerations  : Consider potential for mucosal ulcerations when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease. (  5.5  )



  Suspected GI obstruction or perforation  : Rule out diagnosis before administration. (  4  ,  5.6  )



  Patients at risk for aspiration  : Observe during administration. (  5.7  )



  Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD):  Use with caution. (  5.8  )



  Risks in patients with phenylketonuria  : Contains phenylalanine. (  5.9  )



  Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis:  Inform patients to seek immediate medical care if symptoms occur. (  5.10  )



 



   5.1 Serious Fluid and Electrolyte Abnormalities



  Advise patients to hydrate adequately before, during, and after the use of PLENVU. If a patient develops significant vomiting or signs of dehydration after taking PLENVU, consider performing post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN).



 Bowel Preparations can cause fluid and electrolyte disturbances, which can lead to serious adverse reactions including cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and renal impairment. Correct fluid and electrolyte abnormalities before treatment with PLENVU. PLENVU should be used with caution in patients using concomitant medications that increase the risk of electrolyte abnormalities [such as diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)] [see Drug Interactions (  7.1  )]  . Consider performing pre-dose and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (sodium, potassium, calcium, creatinine, and BUN) in patients receiving these concomitant medications.



    5.2 Cardiac Arrhythmias



  There have been rare reports of serious arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation) associated with the use of ionic osmotic laxative products for bowel preparation. These occur predominantly in patients with underlying cardiac risk factors and electrolyte disturbances. Use caution when prescribing PLENVU for patients at increased risk of arrhythmias (e.g., patients with a history of prolonged QT, uncontrolled arrhythmias, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy or electrolyte imbalance). Consider pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs in patients at increased risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias.



    5.3 Seizures



  There have been rare reports of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and/or loss of consciousness associated with use of bowel preparation products in patients with no prior history of seizures. The seizure cases were associated with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia) and low serum osmolality. The neurologic abnormalities resolved with correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities.



 Use caution when prescribing PLENVU for patients with a history of seizures and in patients at increased risk of seizure, such as patients taking medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants), patients withdrawing from alcohol or benzodiazepines, or patients with known or suspected hyponatremia. [see Drug Interactions (  7.1  )].  



    5.4 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment



  Use PLENVU with caution in patients with renal impairment or patients taking concomitant medications that affect renal function (such as diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) [see Drug Interactions (  7.1  )]  . These patients may be at risk for renal injury. Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration before, during and after the use of PLENVU, and consider performing pre-dose and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.6  )]  .



    5.5 Colonic Mucosal Ulceration, Ischemic Colitis and Ulcerative Colitis



  Osmotic laxatives may produce colonic mucosal aphthous ulcerations, and there have been reports of more serious cases of ischemic colitis requiring hospitalization. Concurrent use of stimulant laxatives and PLENVU may increase the risk and is not recommended. Consider the potential for mucosal ulcerations resulting from the bowel preparation when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease.



    5.6 Use in Patients with Significant Gastrointestinal Disease



  If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, perform appropriate diagnostic studies to rule out these conditions before administering PLENVU [see Contraindications (  4  )]  . Use with caution in patients with severe ulcerative colitis.



    5.7 Aspiration



  Patients with impaired gag reflex or other swallowing abnormalities are at risk for regurgitation or aspiration of PLENVU. Observe these patients during the administration of PLENVU. Use with caution in these patients.



    5.8 Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) Deficiency



  Since PLENVU contains sodium ascorbate and ascorbic acid, PLENVU should be used with caution in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, especially G6PD deficiency patients with an active infection, with a history of hemolysis, or taking concomitant medications known to precipitate hemolytic reactions.



    5.9 Risks in Patients with Phenylketonuria



  Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). PLENVU contains phenylalanine, a component of aspartame. Each PLENVU treatment contains 491 mg of phenylalanine. Before prescribing PLENVU to a patient with PKU, consider the combined daily amount of phenylalanine from all sources, including PLENVU.



    5.10 Hypersensitivity Reactions



  PLENVU contains PEG and may cause serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, urticaria, and pruritus [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  ,  6.2  )]  . Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis, and instruct them to seek immediate medical care should signs and symptoms occur.
