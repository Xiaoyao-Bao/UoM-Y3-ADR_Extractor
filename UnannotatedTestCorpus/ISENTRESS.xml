  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



    EXCERPT:    *  The most common adverse reactions of moderate to severe intensity (&gt;=2%) are insomnia, headache, dizziness, nausea and fatigue (  6.1  ). 
 *  Creatine kinase elevations were observed in subjects who received ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD. Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported. Use with caution in patients at increased risk of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis, such as patients receiving concomitant medications known to cause these conditions and patients with a history of rhabdomyolysis, myopathy or increased serum creatine kinase (  6.2  ).

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

    Treatment-Naive Adults  



 The safety of ISENTRESS was evaluated in HIV-infected treatment-naive subjects in 2 Phase III studies: STARTMRK evaluated ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily versus efavirenz, both in combination with emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), and ONCEMRK evaluated ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg (2 * 600 mg) once daily versus ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily, both in combination with emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Safety data from these two studies are presented side-by-side in Tables 5 and 6 to simplify presentation; direct comparisons across trials should not be made due to differing duration of follow-up and study design.



     STARTMRK (ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily)  



 In STARTMRK, subjects received ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily (N=281) or efavirenz (EFV) 600 mg at bedtime (N=282) both in combination with emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, (N=282). During double-blind treatment, the total follow-up for subjects receiving ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily + emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was 1104 patient-years and 1036 patient-years for subjects receiving efavirenz 600 mg at bedtime + emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.



 In STARTMRK, the rate of discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events through Week 240 was 5% in subjects receiving ISENTRESS + emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and 10% in subjects receiving efavirenz + emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.



     ONCEMRK (ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg [2 * 600 mg] once daily)  



 In ONCEMRK, subjects received ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg once daily (n=531) or ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily (n=266) both in combination with emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. During double-blind treatment, the total follow-up for subjects with ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg once daily was 913 patient-years and for ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily was 450 patient-years.



 In ONCEMRK, the rate of discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events through Week 96 was 1% in subjects receiving ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg (2 * 600 mg) once daily and 2% in subjects receiving ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily.



 Clinical adverse reactions of moderate to severe intensity occurring in &gt;=2% of treatment-naive subjects treated with ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily or efavirenz in STARTMRK through Week 240 or ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg once daily or ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily in ONCEMRK through Week 96 are presented in Table 6.



 In STARTMRK, clinical adverse reactions of all intensities (mild, moderate and severe) occurring in &gt;=2% of subjects on ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily through Week 240 also include diarrhea, flatulence, asthenia, decreased appetite, abnormal dreams, depression and nightmare. In ONCEMRK, clinical adverse reactions of all intensities (mild, moderate and severe) occurring in &gt;=2% of subjects on ISENTRESS HD or ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily through Week 96 also include abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and decreased appetite.

                 Treatment-Experienced Adults  
 

 The safety assessment of ISENTRESS in treatment-experienced subjects is based on the pooled safety data from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2 in antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected adult subjects. A total of 462 subjects received the recommended dose of ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily in combination with optimized background therapy (OBT) compared to 237 subjects taking placebo in combination with OBT. The median duration of therapy in these trials was 96 weeks for subjects receiving ISENTRESS and 38 weeks for subjects receiving placebo. The total exposure to ISENTRESS was 708 patient-years versus 244 patient-years on placebo. The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events were 4% in subjects receiving ISENTRESS and 5% in subjects receiving placebo.



 Clinical ADRs were considered by investigators to be causally related to ISENTRESS + OBT or placebo + OBT. Clinical ADRs of moderate to severe intensity occurring in &gt;=2% of subjects treated with ISENTRESS and occurring at a higher rate compared to placebo are presented in Table 9.



 Table 9: Adverse Drug ReactionsIncludes adverse reactions at least possibly, probably, or definitely related to the drug. of Moderate to Severe IntensityIntensities are defined as follows: Moderate (discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity); Severe (incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity).

              Less Common Adverse Reactions Observed in Treatment-Naive and Treatment-Experienced Studies  
 

 The following ADRs occurred in &lt;2% of treatment-naive or treatment-experienced subjects receiving ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD in a combination regimen. These events have been included because of their seriousness, increased frequency compared with efavirenz or placebo, or investigator's assessment of potential causal relationship.



   Gastrointestinal Disorders:  abdominal pain, gastritis, dyspepsia, vomiting



   General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions:  asthenia



   Hepatobiliary Disorders:  hepatitis



   Immune System Disorders:  hypersensitivity



   Infections and Infestations:  genital herpes, herpes zoster



   Psychiatric Disorders:  depression (particularly in subjects with a pre-existing history of psychiatric illness), including suicidal ideation and behaviors



   Renal and Urinary Disorders:  nephrolithiasis, renal failure



     Selected Adverse Events - Adults  



 In studies of ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily, cancers were reported in treatment-experienced subjects who initiated ISENTRESS or placebo, both with OBT, and in treatment-naive subjects who initiated ISENTRESS or efavirenz, both with emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate; several were recurrent. The types and rates of specific cancers were those expected in a highly immunodeficient population (many had CD4+ counts below 50 cells/mm  3  and most had prior AIDS diagnoses). The risk of developing cancer in these studies was similar in the group receiving ISENTRESS and the group receiving the comparator.



 Grade 2-4 creatine kinase laboratory abnormalities were observed in subjects treated with ISENTRESS and ISENTRESS HD (see  Tables 6  and  8  ). Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported with ISENTRESS. Use with caution in patients at increased risk of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis, such as patients receiving concomitant medications known to cause these conditions and patients with a history of rhabdomyolysis, myopathy or increased serum creatine kinase.



 Rash occurred more commonly in treatment-experienced subjects receiving regimens containing ISENTRESS + darunavir/ritonavir compared to subjects receiving ISENTRESS without darunavir/ritonavir or darunavir/ritonavir without ISENTRESS. However, rash that was considered drug related occurred at similar rates for all three groups. These rashes were mild to moderate in severity and did not limit therapy; there were no discontinuations due to rash.



     Patients with Co-existing Conditions - Adults  



     Patients Co-infected with Hepatitis B and/or Hepatitis C Virus  



 In Phase III studies of ISENTRESS, patients with chronic (but not acute) active hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection were permitted to enroll provided that baseline liver function tests did not exceed 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). In the treatment-experienced studies, BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2, 16% of all patients (114/699) were co-infected; in the treatment-naive studies, STARTMRK and ONCEMRK, 6% (34/563) and 3% (23/797), respectively, were co-infected. In general the safety profile of ISENTRESS in subjects with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection was similar to that in subjects without hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection, although the rates of AST and ALT abnormalities were higher in the subgroup with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection for all treatment groups.



 At 96 weeks, in treatment-experienced subjects receiving ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily, Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities that represent a worsening Grade from baseline of AST, ALT or total bilirubin occurred in 29%, 34% and 13%, respectively, of co-infected subjects treated with ISENTRESS as compared to 11%, 10% and 9% of all other subjects treated with ISENTRESS. At 240 weeks, in treatment-naive subjects receiving ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily, Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities that represent a worsening Grade from baseline of AST, ALT or total bilirubin occurred in 22%, 44% and 17%, respectively, of co-infected subjects treated with ISENTRESS as compared to 13%, 13% and 5% of all other subjects treated with ISENTRESS.



 At 96 weeks, in treatment-naive subjects receiving ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg (2 * 600 mg) once daily, Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities that represent a worsening Grade from baseline of AST, ALT or total bilirubin occurred in 27%, 40% and 13%, respectively, of co-infected subjects treated with ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg once daily as compared to 7%, 5% and 3% of all other subjects treated with ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg once daily.



     Pediatrics  



     2 to 18 Years of Age  



 ISENTRESS has been studied in 126 antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age, in combination with other antiretroviral agents in IMPAACT P1066  [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.4)  and  Clinical Studies (14.4)  ]  . Of the 126 patients, 96 received the recommended dose of ISENTRESS.



 In these 96 children and adolescents, frequency, type and severity of drug related adverse reactions through Week 24 were comparable to those observed in adults.



 One patient experienced drug related clinical adverse reactions of Grade 3 psychomotor hyperactivity, abnormal behavior and insomnia; one patient experienced a Grade 2 serious drug related allergic rash.



 One patient experienced drug related laboratory abnormalities, Grade 4 AST and Grade 3 ALT, which were considered serious.



     4 Weeks to Less than 2 Years of Age  



 ISENTRESS has also been studied in 26 HIV-1 infected infants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than 2 years of age, in combination with other antiretroviral agents in IMPAACT P1066  [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.4)  and  Clinical Studies (14.4)  ]  .



 In these 26 infants and toddlers, the frequency, type and severity of drug-related adverse reactions through Week 48 were comparable to those observed in adults.



 One patient experienced a Grade 3 serious drug-related allergic rash that resulted in treatment discontinuation.



     HIV-1 Exposed Neonates  



 Forty-two neonates were treated with ISENTRESS for up to 6 weeks from birth, and followed for a total of 24 weeks in IMPAACT P1110  [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.4)  ].  There were no drug related clinical adverse reactions and three drug-related laboratory adverse reactions (one case of transient Grade 4 neutropenia in a subject receiving zidovudine-containing regimen for prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT), and two bilirubin elevations (one each, Grade 1 and Grade 2) considered non-serious and not requiring specific therapy). The safety profile in neonates was generally similar to that observed in older patients treated with ISENTRESS. No clinically meaningful differences in the adverse event profile of neonates were observed when compared to adults.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ISENTRESS. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders:  thrombocytopenia



   Gastrointestinal Disorders:  diarrhea



   Hepatobiliary Disorders:  hepatic failure (with and without associated hypersensitivity) in patients with underlying liver disease and/or concomitant medications



   Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders:  rhabdomyolysis



   Nervous System Disorders:  cerebellar ataxia



   Psychiatric Disorders:  anxiety, paranoia

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Severe, potentially life-threatening and fatal skin reactions have been reported. This includes cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, hypersensitivity reaction and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Immediately discontinue treatment with ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD and other suspect agents if severe hypersensitivity, severe rash, or rash with systemic symptoms or liver aminotransferase elevations develops and monitor clinical status, including liver aminotransferases closely (  5.1  ). 
 *  Monitor for Immune Reconstitution Syndrome (  5.2  ). 
 *  Inform patients with phenylketonuria that the 100 mg and 25 mg chewable tablets contain phenylalanine (  5.3  ). 
    
 

   5.1 Severe Skin and Hypersensitivity Reactions



  Severe, potentially life-threatening, and fatal skin reactions have been reported. These include cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported and were characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and sometimes, organ dysfunction, including hepatic failure. Discontinue ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD and other suspect agents immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions develop (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, hepatitis, eosinophilia, angioedema). Clinical status including liver aminotransferases should be monitored and appropriate therapy initiated. Delay in stopping ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD treatment or other suspect agents after the onset of severe rash may result in a life-threatening reaction.



    5.2 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome



  Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including ISENTRESS. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium  infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci  pneumonia, tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.



 Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.



    5.3 Phenylketonurics



  ISENTRESS Chewable Tablets contain phenylalanine, a component of aspartame. Each 25 mg ISENTRESS Chewable Tablet contains approximately 0.05 mg phenylalanine. Each 100 mg ISENTRESS Chewable Tablet contains approximately 0.10 mg phenylalanine. Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria.
