  Precise frequency data are not available.



 Initial dosing may produce flatulence and intestinal cramps, which are usually transient. Excessive dosage can lead to diarrhea with potential complications such as loss of fluids, hypokalemia, and hypernatremia.



 Nausea and vomiting have been reported.

    General  



  Since lactulose solution contains galactose (less than 1 .  6 g/15 mL) and lactose (less than 1 .  2 g/15 mL) it should be used with caution in diabetics.



     Information for Patients  



  In the event that an unusual diarrheal condition occurs, contact your physician.



     Laboratory Tests  



  Elderly, debilitated patients who receive lactulose for more than six months should have serum electrolytes (potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide) measured periodically.



     Drug Interactions  



  Results of preliminary studies in humans and rats suggest that non-absorbable antacids given concurrently with lactulose may inhibit the desired lactulose-induced drop in colonic pH. Therefore, a possible lack of desired effect of treatment should be taken into consideration before such drugs are given concomitantly with lactulose solution.



     Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  



  There are no known human data on long-term potential for carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, or impairment of fertility.



 There are no known animal data on long-term potential for mutagenicity.



 Administration of lactulose solution in the diet of mice for 18 months in concentrations of 3 and 10 percent (v/w) did not produce any evidence of carcinogenicity.



 In studies of mice, rats, and rabbits, doses of lactulose solution up to 6 or 12 mL/kg/day produced no deleterious effects in breeding, conception, or parturition.



     Pregnancy  



   Teratogenic Effects



   Pregnancy category B  . Reproduction studies have been performed in mice, rats, and rabbits at doses up to 3 or 6 times the usual human oral dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to lactulose. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.



     Nursing Mothers  



  It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when lactulose solution is administered to a nursing woman.



     Pediatric Use  



  Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings">     WARNINGS  



  A theoretical hazard may exist for patients being treated with lactulose solution who may be required to undergo electrocautery procedures during proctoscopy or colonoscopy. Accumulation of H2gas in significant concentration in the presence of an electrical spark may result in an explosive reaction. Although this complication has not been reported with lactulose, patients on lactulose therapy undergoing such procedures should have a thorough bowel cleansing with a non-fermentable solution. Insufflation of CO2as an additional safeguard may be pursued but is considered to be a redundant measure.
