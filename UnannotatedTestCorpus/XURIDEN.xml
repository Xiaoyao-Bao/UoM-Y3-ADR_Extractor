  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions and using a wide range of doses, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The safety of XURIDEN was assessed in 4 patients with hereditary orotic aciduria ranging in age from 3 to 19 years (3 male, 1 female) who received 60 mg/kg of XURIDEN once daily for six weeks. The patients continued to receive XURIDEN for at least 9 months at dosages of up to 120 mg/kg once daily. No adverse reactions were reported with XURIDEN.
