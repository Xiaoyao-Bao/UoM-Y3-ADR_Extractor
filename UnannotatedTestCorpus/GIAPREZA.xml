  EXCERPT:   The most common adverse reactions reported in greater than 10% in GIAPREZA treated patients were thromboembolic events. (  6.1  )



   To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact La Jolla Pharmaceutical Company at 1-800-651-3861 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or  www.fda.gov/medwatch  .  



 

  6.1. Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     ATHOS-3  



 The safety of GIAPREZA was evaluated in ATHOS-3  [see  Warnings and Precautions(5.1)  ]  . Patients in ATHOS-3 were receiving other vasopressors in addition to GIAPREZA or placebo, which were titrated to effect on mean arterial pressure (MAP).



 Table 2 summarizes adverse reactions with an incidence of at least 4% among patients treated with GIAPREZA and with a rate of at least 1.5% higher with GIAPREZA than with placebo.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  There is a potential for venous and arterial thrombotic and thromboembolic events in patients who receive GIAPREZA. Use concurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis. (  5.1  ,  6.1  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Risk for Thrombosis



  The safety of GIAPREZA was evaluated in 321 adults with septic or other distributive shock in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, ATHOS-3. There was a higher incidence of arterial and venous thrombotic and thromboembolic events in patients who received GIAPREZA compared to placebo-treated patients in the ATHOS-3 study (13% vs. 5%). The major imbalance was in deep venous thromboses. Use concurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis.
