  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)  



 The incidence of adverse events has been ascertained from worldwide clinical trials in 965 BPH patients. The incidence rates presented below (Table 2) are based on combined data from seven placebo-controlled trials involving once-daily administration of CARDURA in doses of 1 to 16 mg in hypertensives and 0.5 to 8 mg in normotensives. Adverse reactions occurring more than 1% more frequently in BPH patients treated with CARDURA vs placebo are summarized in Table 1.

     Hypertension  



 CARDURA has been administered to approximately 4000 hypertensive patients in clinical trials, of whom 1679 were included in the hypertension clinical development program. In placebo-controlled studies, adverse events occurred in 49% and 40% of patients in the doxazosin and placebo groups, respectively, and led to discontinuation in 2% of patients in each group.



 Adverse reactions occurring more than 1% more frequently in hypertensive patients treated with CARDURA vs placebo are summarized in Table 1. . Postural effects and edema appeared to be dose-related. The prevalence rates presented below are based on combined data from placebo-controlled studies involving once-daily administration of doxazosin at doses ranging from 1 to 16 mg.

         Other adverse reactions occurring less than 1% more frequently in hypertensive patients treated with CARDURA vs placebo but plausibly related to CARDURA use include vertigo, hypotension, hot flushes, epistaxis and oedema.
 

 CARDURA has been associated with decreases in white blood cell counts



     Laboratory changes observed in clinical studies  



     Leukopenia/Neutropenia:  Decreases in mean white blood cell (WBC) and mean neutrophil count were observed in controlled clinical trials of hypertensive patients receiving CARDURA. In cases where follow-up was available, WBC and neutrophil counts returned to normal after discontinuation of CARDURA. No patients became symptomatic as a result of the low WBC or neutrophil counts.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of CARDURA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 In post-marketing experience, the following additional adverse reactions have been reported:  Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders:  leukopenia, thrombocytopenia;  Immune System Disorders:  allergic reaction;  Nervous System Disorders:  hypoesthesia;  Eye Disorders:  Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome  [see  Warnings and precautions (5.4)  ]  ;  Cardiac Disorders:  bradycardia;  Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders:  bronchospasm aggravated;  Gastrointestinal Disorders:  vomiting;  Hepatobiliary Disorders:  cholestasis, hepatitis cholestatic;  Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders:  urticaria;  Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders:  muscle cramps, muscle weakness;  Renal and Urinary Disorders:  hematuria, micturition disorder, micturition frequency, nocturia;  Reproductive System and Breast Disorders:  gynecomastia, priapism.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Postural hypotension with or without syncope may occur. (  5.1  ) 
 *  Risk of Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome during cataract surgery. (  5.2  ) 
 *  Screen for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment for BPH and at regular intervals afterwards. (  5.3  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Postural Hypotension



  Postural hypotension with or without symptoms (e.g., dizziness) may develop within a few hours following administration of CARDURA. However, infrequently, symptomatic postural hypotension has also been reported later than a few hours after dosing. As with other alpha-blockers, there is a potential for syncope, especially after the initial dose or after an increase in dosage strength. Advise patient how to avoid symptoms resulting from postural hypotension and what measures to take should they develop.



 Concomitant administration of CARDURA with a PDE-5 inhibitor can result in additive blood pressure lowering effects and symptomatic hypotension.



    5.2 Cataract Surgery



  Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha1blockers. This variant of small pupil syndrome is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs, and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's surgeon should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. There does not appear to be a benefit of stopping alpha1blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery.



    5.3 Prostate Cancer



  Carcinoma of the prostate causes many of the symptoms associated with BPH and the two disorders frequently co-exist. Carcinoma of the prostate should therefore be ruled out prior to commencing therapy with CARDURA for the treatment of BPH.



    5.4 Priapism



  Alpha1 antagonists, including doxazosin, have been associated with priapism (painful penile erection, sustained for hours and unrelieved by sexual intercourse or masturbation). This condition can lead to permanent impotence if not promptly treated.
