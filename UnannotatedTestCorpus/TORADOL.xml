  Adverse reaction rates increase with higher doses of TORADOL. Practitioners should be alert for the severe complications of treatment with TORADOL, such as GI ulceration, bleeding and perforation, postoperative bleeding, acute renal failure, anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions and liver failure (see    Boxed WARNING    ,    WARNINGS    ,    PRECAUTIONS    , and    DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION    ). These NSAID-related complications can be serious in certain patients for whom TORADOL is indicated, especially when the drug is used inappropriately.



 In patients taking TORADOL or other NSAIDs in clinical trials, the most frequently reported adverse experiences in approximately 1% to 10% of patients are:




 Gastrointestinal (GI) experiences including:   
 abdominal pain                            constipation/diarrhea           dyspepsia                        
 flatulence                                GI fullness                     GI ulcers (gastric/duodenal)     
 gross bleeding/perforation                heartburn                       nausea

   Postmarketing Surveillance Study

  A large postmarketing observational, nonrandomized study, involving approximately 10,000 patients receiving ketorolac tromethamine    IV/IM    , demonstrated that the risk of clinically serious gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding was dose-dependent (see    Tables 3A    and    3B    ). This was particularly true in elderly patients who received an average daily dose greater than 60 mg/day of ketorolac tromethamine    IV/IM    (see    Table 3A    ).

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING

  WARNING

    TORADOL    ORAL     (ketorolac tromethamine), a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is indicated for the short-term (up to 5 days in adults), management of moderately severe acute pain that requires analgesia at the opioid level and only as continuation treatment following IV or IM dosing of ketorolac tromethamine, if necessary. The total combined duration of use of TORADOL    ORAL     and ketorolac tromethamine should not exceed 5 days.   



   TORADOL    ORAL     is not indicated for use in pediatric patients and it is NOT indicated for minor or chronic painful conditions. Increasing the dose of TORADOL    ORAL     beyond a daily maximum of 40 mg in adults will not provide better efficacy but will increase the risk of developing serious adverse events.  



   GASTROINTESTINAL RISK

    *  Ketorolac tromethamine, including TORADOL can cause peptic ulcers, gastrointestinal bleeding and/or perforation of the stomach or intestines, which can be fatal. These events can occur at any time during use and without warning symptoms. Therefore, TORADOL is CONTRAINDICATED in patients with active peptic ulcer disease, in patients with recent gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation, and in patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Elderly patients are at greater risk for serious gastrointestinal events (see WARNINGS). 
      CARDIOVASCULAR RISK
     *  NSAIDs may cause an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which can be fatal. This risk may increase with duration of use. Patients with cardiovascular disease or risk factors for cardiovascular disease may be at greater risk (see WARNINGS and CLINICAL STUDIES). 
 *  TORADOL is CONTRAINDICATED for the treatment of peri-operative pain in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery (see WARNINGS). 
      RENAL RISK
     *  TORADOL is CONTRAINDICATED in patients with advanced renal impairment and in patients at risk for renal failure due to volume depletion (see WARNINGS). 
      RISK OF BLEEDING
     *  TORADOL inhibits platelet function and is, therefore, CONTRAINDICATED in patients with suspected or confirmed cerebrovascular bleeding, patients with hemorrhagic diathesis, incomplete hemostasis and those at high risk of bleeding (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS). 
      TORADOL is CONTRAINDICATED as prophylactic analgesic before any major surgery.  
 

   RISK DURING LABOR AND DELIVERY

  The use of TORADOL in labor and delivery is contraindicated because it may adversely affect fetal circulation and inhibit uterine contractions.



   CONCOMITANT USE WITH NSAIDS

    *  TORADOL is CONTRAINDICATED in patients currently receiving aspirin or NSAIDs because of the cumulative risk of inducing serious NSAID-related side effects. 
      SPECIAL POPULATIONS
     *  Dosage should be adjusted for patients 65 years or older, for patients under 50 kg (110 lbs) of body weight (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION) and for patients with moderately elevated serum creatinine (see WARNINGS). 
</Section>
    <Section id="S3" name="precautions">    PRECAUTIONS



   General



  TORADOL cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids may lead to disease exacerbation. Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is made to discontinue corticosteroids.



 The pharmacological activity of TORADOL in reducing inflammation may diminish the utility of this diagnostic sign in detecting complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions.



    Hepatic Effect



  TORADOL should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or a history of liver disease. Borderline elevations of one or more liver tests may occur in up to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs including TORADOL. These laboratory abnormalities may progress, may remain unchanged, or may be transient with continuing therapy. Notable elevations of ALT or AST (approximately three or more times the upper limit of normal) have been reported in approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials with NSAIDs. In addition, rare cases of severe hepatic reactions, including jaundice and fatal fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis and hepatic failure, some of them with fatal outcomes have been reported.



 A patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom an abnormal liver test has occurred, should be evaluated for evidence of the development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapy with TORADOL. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), TORADOL should be discontinued.



    Hematologic Effect



  Anemia is sometimes seen in patients receiving NSAIDs, including TORADOL. This may be due to fluid retention, occult or gross GI blood loss, or an incompletely described effect upon erythropoiesis. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs, including TORADOL, should have their hemoglobin or hematocrit checked if they exhibit any signs or symptoms of anemia. NSAIDs inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolong bleeding time in some patients. Unlike aspirin, their effect on platelet function is quantitatively less, of shorter duration, and reversible. Patients receiving TORADOL who may be adversely affected by alterations in platelet function, such as those with coagulation disorders or patients receiving anticoagulants, should be carefully monitored.



    Preexisting Asthma



  Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use of aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with severe bronchospasm which can be fatal. Since cross reactivity, including bronchospasm, between aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, TORADOL should not be administered to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and should be used with caution in patients with preexisting asthma.



    Information for Patients



  TORADOL is a potent NSAID and may cause serious side effects such as gastrointestinal bleeding or kidney failure, which may result in hospitalization and even fatal outcome.



 Physicians, when prescribing TORADOL, should inform their patients or their guardians of the potential risks of TORADOL treatment (see   Boxed WARNING    ,   WARNINGS    ,   PRECAUTIONS    , and   ADVERSE REACTIONS    sections), instruct patients to seek medical advice if they develop treatment-related adverse events, and advise patients not to give TORADOL   ORAL    to other family members and to discard any unused drug.  



 Remember that the total combined duration of use of TORADOL   ORAL    and IV or IM dosing of ketorolac tromethamine is not to exceed 5 days in adults. TORADOL   ORAL    is not indicated for use in pediatric patients.



 Patients should be informed of the following information before initiating therapy with an NSAID and periodically during the course of ongoing therapy. Patients should also be encouraged to read the NSAID Medication Guide that accompanies each prescription dispensed.



 *  TORADOL, like other NSAIDs, may cause serious CV side effects, such as MI or stroke, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious CV events can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, slurring of speech, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms. Patients should be apprised of the importance of this follow-up (see   WARNINGS: Cardiovascular Effects   ). 
 *  TORADOL, like other NSAIDs, can cause GI discomfort and rarely, serious GI side effects, such as ulcers and bleeding, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms including epigastric pain, dyspepsia, melena, and hematemesis. Patients should be apprised of the importance of this follow-up (see   WARNINGS: Gastrointestinal Effects - Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation   ). 
 *  TORADOL, like other NSAIDs, can cause serious skin side effects such as exfoliative dermatitis, SJS, and TEN, which may result in hospitalizations and even death. Although serious skin reactions may occur without warning, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of skin rash and blisters, fever, or other signs of hypersensitivity such as itching, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative signs or symptoms. Patients should be advised to stop the drug immediately if they develop any type of rash and contact their physicians as soon as possible. 
 *  Patients should promptly report signs or symptoms of unexplained weight gain or edema to their physicians. 
 *  Patients should be informed of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (eg, nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flu-like" symptoms). If these occur, patients should be instructed to stop therapy and seek immediate medical therapy. 
 *  Patients should be informed of the signs of an anaphylactoid reaction (eg, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat). If these occur, patients should be instructed to seek immediate emergency help (see   WARNINGS   ). 
 *  In late pregnancy, as with other NSAIDs, TORADOL should be avoided because it will cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus. 
       Laboratory Tests
 

  Because serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs or symptoms of GI bleeding. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs, should have their CBC and a chemistry profile checked periodically. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver or renal disease develop, systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.) or if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, TORADOL should be discontinued.



    Drug Interactions



  Ketorolac is highly bound to human plasma protein (mean 99.2%). There is no evidence in animal or human studies that TORADOL induces or inhibits hepatic enzymes capable of metabolizing itself or other drugs.



    Warfarin, Digoxin, Salicylate, and Heparin



  The in vitro binding of warfarin  to plasma proteins is only slightly reduced by ketorolac tromethamine (99.5% control vs 99.3%) when ketorolac plasma concentrations reach 5 to 10 ug/mL. Ketorolac does not alter digoxin  protein binding. In vitro studies indicate that, at therapeutic concentrations of salicylate  (300 ug/mL), the binding of ketorolac was reduced from approximately 99.2% to 97.5%, representing a potential twofold increase in unbound ketorolac plasma levels. Therapeutic concentrations of digoxin, warfarin, ibuprofen, naproxen, piroxicam, acetaminophen, phenytoin  and tolbutamide  did not alter ketorolac tromethamine protein binding.



 In a study involving 12 adult volunteers, TORADOL   ORAL    was coadministered with a single dose of 25 mg warfarin  , causing no significant changes in pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of warfarin. In another study, ketorolac tromethamine dosed IV or IM was given with two doses of 5000 U of heparin  to 11 healthy volunteers, resulting in a mean template bleeding time of 6.4 minutes (3.2 to 11.4 min) compared to a mean of 6.0 minutes (3.4 to 7.5 min) for heparin alone and 5.1 minutes (3.5 to 8.5 min) for placebo. Although these results do not indicate a significant interaction between TORADOL and warfarin or heparin, the administration of TORADOL to patients taking anticoagulants should be done extremely cautiously, and patients should be closely monitored (see   WARNINGS    and   PRECAUTIONS: Hematologic Effect    ).



 The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs, in general, on GI bleeding are synergistic, such that the users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI bleeding higher than the users of either drug alone.



    Aspirin



  When TORADOL is administered with aspirin, its protein binding is reduced, although the clearance of free TORADOL is not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known; however, as with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of ketorolac tromethamine and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects.



    Diuretics



  Clinical studies, as well as postmarketing observations, have shown that TORADOL can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely for signs of renal failure (see   WARNINGS: Renal Effects    ), as well as to assure diuretic efficacy.



    Probenecid



  Concomitant administration of TORADOL   ORAL    and probenecid  resulted in decreased clearance and volume of distribution of ketorolac and significant increases in ketorolac plasma levels (total AUC increased approximately threefold from 5.4 to 17.8 ug/h/mL) and terminal half-life increased approximately twofold from 6.6 to 15.1 hours. Therefore, concomitant use of TORADOL and probenecid is contraindicated.



    Lithium



  NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID. Thus, when NSAIDs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity.



    Methotrexate



  NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that they could enhance the toxicity of methotrexate. Caution should be used when NSAIDs are administered concomitantly with methotrexate.



    ACE Inhibitors/Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists



  Concomitant use of ACE inhibitors and/or angiotensin II receptor antagonists  may increase the risk of renal impairment, particularly in volume-depleted patients.



 Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors and/or angiotensin II receptor antagonists. This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE inhibitors and/or angiotensin II receptor antagonists.



    Antiepileptic Drugs



  Sporadic cases of seizures have been reported during concomitant use of TORADOL and antiepileptic drugs  (phenytoin, carbamazepine).



    Psychoactive Drugs



  Hallucinations have been reported when TORADOL was used in patients taking psychoactive drugs  (fluoxetine, thiothixene, alprazolam).



    Pentoxifylline



  When ketorolac tromethamine is administered concurrently with pentoxifylline, there is an increased tendency to bleeding.



    Nondepolarizing Muscle Relaxants



  In postmarketing experience there have been reports of a possible interaction between ketorolac tromethamine   IV/IM    and nondepolarizing muscle relaxants  that resulted in apnea. The concurrent use of ketorolac tromethamine with muscle relaxants has not been formally studied.



    Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)



  There is an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding when selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are combined with NSAIDs. Caution should be used when NSAIDs are administered concomitantly with SSRIs.



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility



  An 18-month study in mice with oral doses of ketorolac tromethamine at 2 mg/kg/day (0.9 times the human systemic exposure at the recommended IM or IV dose of 30 mg qid, based on area-under-the-plasma-concentration curve [AUC]), and a 24-month study in rats at 5 mg/kg/day (0.5 times the human AUC) showed no evidence of tumorigenicity.



 Ketorolac tromethamine was not mutagenic in the Ames test, unscheduled DNA synthesis and repair, and in forward mutation assays. Ketorolac tromethamine did not cause chromosome breakage in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. At 1590 ug/mL and at higher concentrations, ketorolac tromethamine increased the incidence of chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovarian cells.



 Impairment of fertility did not occur in male or female rats at oral doses of 9 mg/kg (0.9 times the human AUC) and 16 mg/kg (1.6 times the human AUC) of ketorolac tromethamine, respectively.



    Pregnancy



    Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C  



  Reproduction studies have been performed during organogenesis using daily oral doses of ketorolac tromethamine at 3.6 mg/kg (0.37 times the human AUC) in rabbits and at 10 mg/kg (1.0 times the human AUC) in rats. Results of these studies did not reveal evidence of teratogenicity to the fetus. However, animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response.



     Nonteratogenic Effects  



  Because of the known effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the fetal cardiovascular system (closure of ductus arteriosus), use during pregnancy (particularly late pregnancy) should be avoided. Oral doses of ketorolac tromethamine at 1.5 mg/kg (0.14 times the human AUC), administered after gestation Day 17, caused dystocia and higher pup mortality in rats.



 There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of TORADOL in pregnant women. TORADOL should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.



    Labor and Delivery



  The use of TORADOL is contraindicated in labor and delivery because, through its prostaglandin synthesis inhibitory effect, it may adversely affect fetal circulation and inhibit uterine contractions, thus increasing the risk of uterine hemorrhage (see   CONTRAINDICATIONS    ).



    Effects on Fertility



  The use of ketorolac tromethamine, as with any drug known to inhibit cyclooxygenase/prostaglandin synthesis, may impair fertility and is not recommended in women attempting to conceive. In women who have difficulty conceiving or are undergoing investigation of infertility, withdrawal of ketorolac tromethamine should be considered.



    Nursing Mothers



  Limited data from one published study involving 10 breastfeeding women 2-6 days postpartum showed low levels of ketorolac in breast milk. Levels were undetectable (less than 5 ng/mL) in 4 of the patients. After a single administration of 10 mg of TORADOL   ORAL    , the maximum milk concentration observed was 7.3 ng/mL, and the maximum milk-to-plasma ratio was 0.037. After 1 day of dosing (10 mg every 6 hours), the maximum milk concentration was 7.9 ng/mL, and the maximum milk-to-plasma ratio was 0.025. Assuming a daily intake of 400-1,000 mL of human milk per day and a maternal body weight of 60 kg, the calculated maximum daily infant exposure was 0.00263 mg/kg/day, which is 0.4% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose.



 Exercise caution when ketorolac is administered to a nursing woman. Available information has not shown any specific adverse events in nursing infants; however, instruct patients to contact their infant's health care provider if they note any adverse events.



    Pediatric Use



  TORADOL   ORAL    is not indicated for use in pediatric patients. The safety and effectiveness of TORADOL   ORAL    in pediatric patients below the age of 17 have not been established.



    Geriatric Use (&gt;=65 years of age)



  Because ketorolac tromethamine may be cleared more slowly by the elderly (see   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY    ) who are also more sensitive to the dose-related adverse effects of NSAIDs (see   WARNINGS: Gastrointestinal Effects - Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation    ), extreme caution, reduced dosages (see   DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION    ), and careful clinical monitoring must be used when treating the elderly with TORADOL.
</Section>
    <Section id="S4" name="warnings">    WARNINGS



   (see also  Boxed WARNING  )  



 The total combined duration of use of TORADOL   ORAL    and IV or IM dosing of ketorolac tromethamine is not to exceed 5 days in adults. TORADOL   ORAL    is not indicated for use in pediatric patients.



 The most serious risks associated with TORADOL are:



    Gastrointestinal Effects - Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation



  TORADOL is contraindicated in patients with previously documented peptic ulcers and/or GI bleeding. Toradol can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including bleeding, ulceration and perforation, of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with TORADOL.



 Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Minor upper gastrointestinal problems, such as dyspepsia, are common and may also occur at any time during NSAID therapy. The incidence and severity of gastrointestinal complications increases with increasing dose of, and duration of treatment with, TORADOL. Do not use TORADOL for more than five days. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk. In addition to past history of ulcer disease, other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.



  To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration.  Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of TORADOL until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.



 NSAIDs should be given with care to patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease) as their condition may be exacerbated.



    Hemorrhage



  Because prostaglandins play an important role in hemostasis and NSAIDs affect platelet aggregation as well, use of TORADOL in patients who have coagulation disorders should be undertaken very cautiously, and those patients should be carefully monitored. Patients on therapeutic doses of anticoagulants (e.g., heparin or dicumarol derivatives) have an increased risk of bleeding complications if given TORADOL concurrently; therefore, physicians should administer such concomitant therapy only extremely cautiously. The concurrent use of TORADOL and therapy that affects hemostasis, including prophylactic low-dose heparin (2500 to 5000 units q12h), warfarin and dextrans have not been studied extensively, but may also be associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Until data from such studies are available, physicians should carefully weigh the benefits against the risks and use such concomitant therapy in these patients only extremely cautiously. Patients receiving therapy that affects hemostasis should be monitored closely.



 In postmarketing experience, postoperative hematomas and other signs of wound bleeding have been reported in association with the peri-operative use of IV or IM dosing of ketorolac tromethamine. Therefore, peri-operative use of TORADOL should be avoided and postoperative use be undertaken with caution when hemostasis is critical (see   PRECAUTIONS    ).



    Renal Effects



  Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.



 TORADOL and its metabolites are eliminated primarily by the kidneys, which, in patients with reduced creatinine clearance, will result in diminished clearance of the drug (see   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY    ). Therefore, TORADOL should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function (see   DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION    ) and such patients should be followed closely. With the use of TORADOL, there have been reports of acute renal failure, interstitial nephritis and nephrotic syndrome.



    Impaired Renal Function



  TORADOL is  contraindicated in patients with serum creatinine concentrations indicating advanced renal impairment (see   CONTRAINDICATIONS    ). TORADOL should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function or a history of kidney disease because it is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis. Because patients with underlying renal insufficiency are at increased risk of developing acute renal decompensation or failure, the risks and benefits should be assessed prior to giving TORADOL to these patients.



    Anaphylactoid Reactions



  As with other NSAIDs, anaphylactoid reactions may occur in patients without a known previous exposure or hypersensitivity to TORADOL. TORADOL should not be given to patients with the aspirin triad. This symptom complex typically occurs in asthmatic patients who experience rhinitis with or without nasal polyps, or who exhibit severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs (see   CONTRAINDICATIONS    and   PRECAUTIONS: Preexisting Asthma    ). Anaphylactoid reactions, like anaphylaxis, may have a fatal outcome. Emergency help should be sought in cases where an anaphylactoid reaction occurs.



    Cardiovascular Effects



   Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events



  Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, myocardial infarction,and stroke, which can be fatal. All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may have a similar risk. Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may be at greater risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.



 There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID does increase the risk of serious GI events (see   Gastrointestinal Effects- Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation    ). Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10-14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke (see   CONTRAINDICATIONS    ).



    Hypertension



  NSAIDs, including TORADOL, can lead to onset of new hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking thiazides or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. NSAIDs, including TORADOL, should be used with caution in patients with hypertension. Blood pressure (BP) should be monitored closely during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.



    Congestive Heart Failure and Edema



  Fluid retention, edema, retention of NaCl, oliguria, elevations of serum urea nitrogen and creatinine have been reported in clinical trials with TORADOL. Therefore, TORADOL should be used only very cautiously in patients with cardiac decompensation, hypertension or similar conditions.



    Skin Reactions



  NSAIDs, including TORADOL, can cause serious skin adverse events such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Patients should be informed about the signs and symptoms of serious skin manifestations and use of the drug should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash, mucosal lesions, or any other sign of hypersensitivity.



    Pregnancy



  In late pregnancy, as with other NSAIDs, TORADOL should be avoided because it may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus.
