  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying and controlled conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     Plaque Psoriasis  



     Weeks 0 to 12  :



 Three placebo-controlled trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis were integrated to evaluate the safety of TALTZ compared to placebo for up to 12 weeks. A total of 1167 subjects (mean age 45 years; 66% men; 94% White) with plaque psoriasis received TALTZ (160 mg at Week 0, 80 mg every 2 weeks [Q2W] for 12 weeks) subcutaneously. In two of the trials, the safety of TALTZ (use up to 12 weeks) was also compared with an active comparator, U.S. approved etanercept  [see Clinical Studies (  14  )]  .



 In the 12-week, placebo-controlled period, adverse events occurred in 58% of the TALTZ Q2W group (2.5 per subject-year of follow-up) compared with 47% of the placebo group (2.1 per subject-year of follow-up). Serious adverse events occurred in 2% of the TALTZ group (0.07 per subject-year of follow-up), and in 2% of the placebo group (0.07 per subject-year of follow-up).



   Table 1  summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 1% and at a higher rate in the TALTZ group than in the placebo group during the 12-week placebo-controlled period of the pooled clinical trials.

          Adverse reactions that occurred at rates less than 1% in the TALTZ group and more frequently than in the placebo group during the 12-week induction period included rhinitis, oral candidiasis, urticaria, influenza, conjunctivitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and angioedema.
 

     Weeks 13 to 60  :



 A total of 332 subjects received the recommended maintenance regimen of TALTZ 80 mg dosed every 4 weeks.



 During the maintenance period (Weeks 13 to 60), adverse events occurred in 80% of subjects treated with TALTZ (1.0 per subject-year of follow-up) compared to 58% of subjects treated with placebo (1.1 per subject-year of follow-up). Serious adverse events were reported in 4% of subjects treated with TALTZ (0.05 per subject-year of follow-up) and none in the subjects treated with placebo.



     Weeks 0 to 60  :



 Over the entire treatment period (Weeks 0 to 60), adverse events were reported in 67% of subjects treated with TALTZ (1.4 per subject-year of follow-up) compared to 48% of subjects treated with placebo (2.0 per subject-year of follow-up). Serious adverse events were reported in 3% of subjects treated with TALTZ (0.06 per subject-year of follow-up), and in 2% of subjects treated with placebo (0.06 per subject-year of follow-up).



     Specific Adverse Drug Reactions  :



     Injection Site Reactions  



 The most frequent injection site reactions were erythema and pain. Most injection site reactions were mild-to-moderate in severity and did not lead to discontinuation of TALTZ.



     Infections  



 In the 12-week, placebo-controlled period of the clinical trials in plaque psoriasis, infections occurred in 27% of subjects treated with TALTZ (1.2 per subject-year of follow-up) compared to 23% of subjects treated with placebo (1.0 per subject-year of follow-up). Serious infections occurred in 0.4% of subjects treated with TALTZ (0.02 per subject-year of follow-up) and in 0.4% of subjects treated with placebo (0.02 per subject-year of follow-up)  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )]  .



 During the maintenance treatment period (Weeks 13 to 60), infections occurred in 57% of subjects treated with TALTZ (0.70 per subject-year of follow-up) compared to 32% of subjects treated with placebo (0.61 per subject-year of follow-up). Serious infections occurred in 0.9% of subjects treated with TALTZ (0.01 per subject-year of follow-up) and none in the subjects treated with placebo.



 Over the entire treatment period (Weeks 0 to 60), infections were reported in 38% of subjects treated with TALTZ (0.83 per subject-year of follow-up) compared to 23% of subjects treated with placebo (1.0 per subject-year of follow-up). Serious infections occurred in 0.7% of subjects treated with TALTZ (0.02 per subject-year of follow-up), and in 0.4% of subject treated with placebo (0.02 per subject-year of follow-up).



     Laboratory Assessment of Cytopenia  



   Neutropenia



 Over the entire treatment period (Weeks 0 to 60), neutropenia occurred in 11% of subjects treated with TALTZ (0.24 per subject-year of follow-up) compared to 3% of subjects treated with placebo (0.14 per subject-year of follow-up). In subjects treated with TALTZ, the incidence rate of neutropenia during Weeks 13 to 60 was lower than the incidence rate during Weeks 0 to 12.



 In the 12-week, placebo-controlled period, neutropenia &gt;= Grade 3 (&lt;1,000 cells/mm  3  ) occurred in 0.2% of the TALTZ group (0.007 per subject-year of follow-up) compared to 0.1% of the placebo group (0.006 per subject-year of follow-up). The majority of cases of neutropenia were either Grade 2 (2% for TALTZ 80 mg Q2W versus 0.3% for placebo; &gt;=1,000 to &lt;1,500 cells/mm  3  ) or Grade 1 (7% for TALTZ 80 mg Q2W versus 3% for placebo; &gt;=1,500 cells/mm  3  to Ë‚2,000 cells/mm  3  ). Neutropenia in the TALTZ group was not associated with an increased rate of infection compared to the placebo group.



   Thrombocytopenia



 Ninety eight percent of cases of thrombocytopenia were Grade 1 (3% for TALTZ 80 mg Q2W versus 1% for placebo; &gt;=75,000 cells/mm  3  to &lt;150,000 cells/mm  3  ). Thrombocytopenia in subjects treated with TALTZ was not associated with an increased rate of bleeding compared to subjects treated with placebo.



     Active Comparator Trials  



 In the two clinical trials that included an active comparator, the rate of serious adverse events during weeks zero to twelve was 0.7% for U.S. approved etanercept and 2% for TALTZ 80 mg Q2W, and the rate of discontinuation from adverse events was 0.7% for U.S. approved etanercept and 2% for TALTZ 80 mg Q2W. The incidence of infections was 18% for U.S. approved etanercept and 26% for TALTZ 80 mg Q2W. The rate of serious infections was 0.3% for both TALTZ 80 mg Q2W and U.S. approved etanercept.



     Psoriatic Arthritis  



 TALTZ was studied in two placebo-controlled trials in patients with psoriatic arthritis. A total of 678 patients were studied (454 patients on TALTZ and 224 on placebo). A total of 229 patients in these trials received TALTZ 160 mg at Week 0, followed by 80 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W). Overall, the safety profile observed in patients with psoriatic arthritis treated with TALTZ Q4W is consistent with the safety profile in patients with plaque psoriasis with the exception of the frequencies of influenza (1.3%) and conjunctivitis (1.3%).



   6.2 Immunogenicity

  As with all therapeutic proteins there is the potential for immunogenicity with TALTZ. The assay to test for neutralizing antibodies has limitations detecting neutralizing antibodies in the presence of ixekizumab; therefore, the incidence of neutralizing antibodies development could be underestimated.



     Plaque Psoriasis Population  



 By Week 12, approximately 9% of subjects treated with TALTZ every 2 weeks developed antibodies to ixekizumab. Approximately 22% of subjects treated with TALTZ at the recommended dosing regimen developed antibodies to ixekizumab during the 60-week treatment period. The clinical effects of antibodies to ixekizumab are dependent on the antibody titer; higher antibody titers were associated with decreasing drug concentration and clinical response.



 Of the subjects who developed antibodies to ixekizumab during the 60-week treatment period, approximately 10%, which equates to 2% of subjects treated with TALTZ at the recommended dosing regimen, had antibodies that were classified as neutralizing. Neutralizing antibodies were associated with reduced drug concentrations and loss of efficacy.



     Psoriatic Arthritis Population  



 For subjects treated with TALTZ 80 mg every 4 weeks for up to 52 weeks (PsA1), 11% developed anti-drug antibodies, the majority of which were low titer, and 8% had confirmed neutralizing antibodies.



 The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of incidence of antibodies to TALTZ across indications or with the incidences of antibodies to other products may be misleading.



   6.3 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of TALTZ. Because the reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to TALTZ exposure.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *   Infections : Serious infections have occurred. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms of clinically important chronic or acute infection occur. If a serious infection develops, discontinue TALTZ until the infection resolves. (  5.1  ) 
 *   Tuberculosis (TB) : Evaluate for TB prior to initiating treatment. (  5.2  ) 
 *   Hypersensitivity : If a serious allergic reaction occurs, discontinue TALTZ immediately and initiate appropriate therapy. (  5.3  ) 
 *   Inflammatory Bowel Disease : Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, including exacerbations, occurred during clinical trials. Patients who are treated with TALTZ and have inflammatory bowel disease should be monitored closely. (  5.4  ) 
    
 

      5.1 Infections



     TALTZ may increase the risk of infection. In clinical trials in patients with plaque psoriasis, the TALTZ group had a higher rate of infections than the placebo group (27% vs. 23%). Upper respiratory tract infections, oral candidiasis, conjunctivitis and tinea infections occurred more frequently in the TALTZ group than in the placebo group. A similar increase in risk of infection was seen in placebo-controlled trials in patients with psoriatic arthritis [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  .



 Instruct patients treated with TALTZ to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms of clinically important chronic or acute infection occur. If a patient develops a serious infection or is not responding to standard therapy, monitor the patient closely and discontinue TALTZ until the infection resolves.



    5.2 Pre-treatment Evaluation for Tuberculosis



  Evaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating treatment with TALTZ. Do not administer to patients with active TB infection. Initiate treatment of latent TB prior to administering TALTZ. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiating TALTZ in patients with a past history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed. Patients receiving TALTZ should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of active TB during and after treatment.



       5.3 Hypersensitivity



     Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and urticaria (each &lt;=0.1%), occurred in the TALTZ group in clinical trials. Anaphylaxis, including cases leading to hospitalization, has been reported in post marketing use with TALTZ [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  ,  6.3  )]  . If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue TALTZ immediately and initiate appropriate therapy.



    5.4 Inflammatory Bowel Disease



  During TALTZ treatment, monitor for onset or exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, including exacerbations, occurred at a greater frequency in the TALTZ group (Crohn's disease 0.1%, ulcerative colitis 0.2%) than the placebo group (0%) during the 12-week, placebo-controlled period in clinical trials in patients with plaque psoriasis.



       5.5 Immunizations



     Prior to initiating therapy with TALTZ, consider completion of all age appropriate immunizations according to current immunization guidelines. Avoid use of live vaccines in patients treated with TALTZ. No data are available on the response to live vaccines.
