  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 The following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials of adult patients treated with ondansetron, the active ingredient of intravenous ZOFRAN across a range of dosages. A causal relationship to therapy with ZOFRAN (ondansetron) was unclear in many cases.

            Cardiovascular:  Rare cases of angina (chest pain), electrocardiographic alterations, hypotension, and tachycardia have been reported.
 

   Gastrointestinal:  Constipation has been reported in 11% of chemotherapy patients receiving multiday ondansetron.



   Hepatic:  In comparative trials in cisplatin chemotherapy patients with normal baseline values of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT), these enzymes have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 5% of patients. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur.



   Integumentary:  Rash has occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ondansetron.



   Neurological:  There have been rare reports consistent with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal reactions in patients receiving ZOFRAN Injection, and rare cases of grand mal seizure.



   Other:  Rare cases of hypokalemia have been reported.



       Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting    

  The adverse reactions in Table 3 have been reported in &gt;=2% of adults receiving ondansetron at a dosage of 4 mg intravenous over 2 to 5 minutes in clinical trials.

           a  Adverse reactions: Rates of these reactions were not significantly different in the ondansetron and placebo groups.
 

   b  Patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications.



   Pediatric Use:

  Rates of adverse reactions were similar in both the ondansetron and placebo groups in pediatric patients receiving ondansetron (a single 0.1-mg/kg dose for pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or less, or 4 mg for pediatric patients weighing more than 40 kg) administered intravenously over at least 30 seconds. Diarrhea was seen more frequently in patients taking ZOFRAN (2%) compared with placebo (&lt;1%) in the 1-month to 24-month age-group. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant perioperative and postoperative medications.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ondansetron. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron.



     Cardiovascular  

  Arrhythmias (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, electrocardiographic alterations (including second-degree heart block, QT/QTc interval prolongation, and ST segment depression), palpitations, and syncope. Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT/QTc interval prolongation have been reported  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]  .



     General  

  Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylactic reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, cardiopulmonary arrest, hypotension, laryngeal edema, laryngospasm, shock, shortness of breath, stridor) have also been reported. A positive lymphocyte transformation test to ondansetron has been reported, which suggests immunologic sensitivity to ondansetron.



     Hepatobiliary  

  Liver enzyme abnormalities have been reported. Liver failure and death have been reported in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics.



     Local Reactions  

  Pain, redness, and burning at site of injection.



     Lower Respiratory  

  Hiccups.



     Neurological  

  Oculogyric crisis, appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions. Transient dizziness during or shortly after intravenous infusion.



     Skin  

  Urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis.



     Eye Disorders  

  Cases of transient blindness, predominantly during intravenous administration, have been reported. These cases of transient blindness were reported to resolve within a few minutes up to 48 hours. Transient blurred vision, in some cases associated with abnormalities of accommodation, has also been reported.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *    Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3receptor antagonists. (  5.1  ) 
 *    QT prolongation occurs in a dose-dependent manner. Cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported. Avoid ZOFRAN in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. (  5.2  ) 
 *    Serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3receptor agonists alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. (  5.3  ) 
 *    Use in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention. (  5.4  ) (  5.5  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions



  Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3receptor antagonists.



    5.2 QT Prolongation



  Ondansetron prolongs the QT interval in a dose-dependent manner [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]  . In addition, postmarketing cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported in patients using ondansetron. Avoid ZOFRAN in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients taking other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation.



    5.3 Serotonin Syndrome



  The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of ZOFRAN alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center.



 Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of ZOFRAN and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue ZOFRAN and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if ZOFRAN is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.5), Overdosage (10), Patient Counseling Information (17)]  .



    5.4 Masking of Progressive Ileus and Gastric Distension



  The use of ZOFRAN in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and gastric distention.



    5.5 Effect on Peristalsis



  ZOFRAN is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction.
