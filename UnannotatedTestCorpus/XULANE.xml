  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 The data described below reflect exposure to norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system in 3330 sexually active women (3322 of whom had safety data) who participated in three Phase 3 clinical trials designed to evaluate contraceptive efficacy and safety. These subjects received six or 13 cycles of contraception (norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system or an oral contraceptive comparator in 2 of the trials). The women ranged in age from 18 to 45 years and were predominantly white (91%).



 The most common adverse reactions (&gt;= 5%) reported during clinical trials were breast symptoms, nausea/vomiting, headache, application site disorder, abdominal pain, dysmenorrhea, vaginal bleeding and menstrual disorders, and mood, affect and anxiety disorders. The most common events leading to discontinuation were application site reaction, breast symptoms (including breast discomfort, engorgement and pain), nausea and/or vomiting, headache and emotional lability.



 Adverse drug reactions reported by &gt;= 2.5% of norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system-treated subjects in these trials are shown in Table 3.

   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions (Table 4) have been identified during postapproval use of norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: CARDIOVASCULAR RISK ASSOCIATED WITH SMOKING, RISK OF VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM, AND PHARMACOKINETIC PROFILE OF ETHINYL ESTRADIOL

  WARNING: CARDIOVASCULAR RISK ASSOCIATED WITH SMOKING, RISK OF VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM, AND PHARMACOKINETIC PROFILE OF ETHINYL ESTRADIOL

    Cigarette Smoking and Serious Cardiovascular Risks  



   Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from hormonal contraceptive use. This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked. For this reason, hormonal contraceptives, including Xulane, should not be used by women who are over 35 years of age and smoke.   



   Risk of Venous Thromboembolism   



   The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) among women aged 15 to 44 who used the norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system compared to women who used several different oral contraceptives was assessed in five U.S. epidemiologic studies using electronic healthcare claims data. The relative risk estimates ranged from 1.2 to 2.2; one of the studies found a statistically significant increased relative risk of VTE for current users of norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  .   



   Pharmacokinetic (PK) Profile of Ethinyl Estradiol (EE)   



   The PK profile for the norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system is different from the PK profile for oral contraceptives in that it has a higher steady state concentrations and a lower peak concentration. Area under the time-concentration curve (AUC) and average concentration at steady state (Css) for EE are approximately 60% higher in women using norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system compared with women using an oral contraceptive containing 35 mcg of EE. In contrast, the peak concentration (Cmax) for EE is approximately 25% lower in women using norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system. It is not known whether there are changes in the risk of serious adverse events based on the differences in PK profiles of EE in women using norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system compared with women using oral contraceptives containing 30 mcg to 35 mcg of EE. Increased estrogen exposure may increase the risk of adverse events, including VTE   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.2)   and   Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ].

   See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.  



   Women over 35 years old who smoke should not use Xulane. (  4  )   



   Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from combination hormonal contraceptives (CHC) use. (  4  )   



   There may be an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) among women who use the Xulane patch compared to women who use certain oral contraceptives. (  5.1  )   



   The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ethinyl estradiol (EE) for the norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system is different from the PK profile for oral contraceptives in that it has higher area under the time-concentration curve, steady state concentrations and lower peak concentrations. (  5.2  )

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *     Vascular risks: Stop Xulane if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (  5.1  ) 
 *     Liver disease: Discontinue Xulane if jaundice occurs. (  5.3  ) 
 *     High blood pressure: Do not prescribe Xulane for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease. (  5.5  ) 
 *     Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking Xulane. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (  5.7  ) 
 *     Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue Xulane if indicated. (  5.8  ) 
 *     Uterine bleeding: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (  5.9  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems



  Stop Xulane if an arterial or deep venous thrombotic event (VTE) occurs.



 Stop Xulane if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately.



 If feasible, stop Xulane at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of VTE. Discontinue use of Xulane during prolonged immobilization and resume treatment based on clinical judgment.



 Start Xulane no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum VTE decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week.



 The use of combination hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) increases the risk of VTE. Known risk factors for VTE include smoking, obesity and family history of VTE, in addition to other factors that contraindicate use of CHCs [see  Contraindications (4)  ]  .



 Five epidemiologic studies  1- 9  that assessed the risk of VTE associated with use of norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system are described below. These are 4 case control studies, that compared VTE rates among women using norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system to rates among women using an OC comparator, and an FDA-funded cohort study that estimated and compared VTE rates among women using various hormonal contraceptives, including norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system. All five studies were retrospective studies from U.S. electronic healthcare databases and included women aged 15 to 44 (10 to 55 in the FDA-funded study) who used norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system or oral contraceptives containing 20 mcg to 35 mcg of ethinyl estradiol (EE) and levonorgestrel (LNG), norethindrone, or norgestimate (NGM). NGM is the prodrug for NGMN, the progestin in Xulane.



 Some of the data from the epidemiologic studies suggest an increased risk of VTE with use of norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system compared to use of some combined oral contraceptives (see Table 1). The studies used slightly different designs and reported relative risk estimates ranging from 1.2 to 2.2. None of the studies have adjusted for body mass index, smoking, and family history of VTE, which are potential confounders. The interpretations of these relative risk estimates range from no increase in risk to an approximate doubling of risk. One of the studies found a statistically significant increased risk of VTE for current users of norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system.



 The five studies are:



 *    The i3 Ingenix study with NGM-containing oral contraceptives as the comparator, including a 24-month extension, based on the Ingenix Research Datamart; this study included patient chart review to confirm the VTE occurrence. 
 *    The Boston Collaborative Drug Surveillance Program (BCDSP) with NGM-containing oral contraceptives as the comparator (BCDSP NGM), including two extensions of 17 and 14 months, respectively, based on the Pharmetrics database, using only non-fatal idiopathic cases. VTE cases were not confirmed by chart review. 
 *    BCDSP with LNG-containing oral contraceptives as the comparator, based on the Pharmetrics database, using only non-fatal idiopathic cases. VTE cases were not confirmed by chart review. 
 *    BCDSP with LNG-containing oral contraceptives as the comparator, based on the Marketscan database, using only non-fatal idiopathic cases. VTE cases were not confirmed by chart review. 
 *    FDA-funded study with two groups of comparators [1) LNG-containing oral contraceptives, and 2) oral contraceptives that contain LNG, norethindrone or norgestimate], based on Kaiser Permanente and Medicaid databases. This study used all cases of VTE (idiopathic and non-idiopathic) and included patient chart review to confirm the VTE occurrence. 
    The i3 Ingenix and BCDSP NGM studies have provided data on additional cases identified in study extensions; however, each study extension was not powered to provide independent estimates of risk. The pooled estimates provide the most reliable estimates of VTE risk. Risk ratios from the original and various extensions of the i3 Ingenix and BCDSP NGM studies are provided in Table 1. The results of these studies are presented in Figure 1.

          Figure 1: VTE Risk of Norelgestromin and Ethinyl Estradiol Transdermal System Relative to Combined Oral Contraceptives  
 

 An increased risk of thromboembolic and thrombotic disease associated with the use of combination hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) is well established. Although the absolute VTE rates are increased for users of CHCs compared to non-users, the rates associated with pregnancy are even greater, especially during the postpartum period (see Figure 2).



 The frequency of VTE in women using CHCs has been estimated to be 3 to 12 cases per 10,000 woman-years.



 The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of CHCs and when restarting hormonal contraception after a break of 4 weeks or longer. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to CHCs gradually disappears after CHC use is discontinued.



 Figure 2 shows the risk of developing a VTE for women who are not pregnant and do not use CHCs, for women who use CHCs, for pregnant women, and for women in the postpartum period.



 To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective: If 10,000 women who are not pregnant and do not use CHCs are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these women will develop a VTE.



  Figure 2: Likelihood of Developing a VTE  



 Use of CHCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as, cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes) and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. In general, the risk is greatest among older (&gt; 35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke. Use CHCs with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors.



  Figure 1: VTE Risk of Norelgestromin and Ethinyl Estradiol Transdermal System Relative to Combined Oral Contraceptives  Figure 2: Likelihood of Developing a VTE    5.2 PK Profile of Ethinyl Estradiol



  The PK profile for the norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system is different from the PK profile for oral contraceptives in that it has a higher Cssand a lower Cmax. AUC and average Cssfor EE are approximately 60% higher in women using norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system compared with women using an oral contraceptive containing EE 35 mcg. In contrast, the Cmaxfor EE is approximately 25% lower in women using norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system. Inter-subject variability results in increased exposure to EE in some women using either norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system or oral contraceptives. However, inter-subject variability in women using norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system is higher. It is not known whether there are changes in the risk of serious adverse events based on the differences in PK profiles of EE in women using norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system compared with women using oral contraceptives containing 30 mcg to 35 mcg of EE. Increased estrogen exposure may increase the risk of adverse events, including venous thromboembolism. [See  Boxed Warning  and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  .]  



    5.3 Liver Disease



     Impaired Liver Function    



  Do not use Xulane in women with liver disease, such as acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of liver [see  Contraindications (4)  ]  . Discontinue Xulane if jaundice develops. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of CHC use until markers of liver function return to normal and CHC causation has been excluded.



      Liver Tumors    



  Xulane is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [see  Contraindications (4)  ]  . Hepatic adenomas are associated with CHC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 CHC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage.



 Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (&gt; 8 years) CHC users. However, the risk of liver cancers in CHC users is less than one case per million users.



    5.4 Risk of Liver Enzyme Elevations with Concomitant Hepatitis C Treatment



  During clinical trials with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen that contains ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, ALT elevations greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), including some cases greater than 20 times the ULN, were significantly more frequent in women using ethinyl estradiol-containing medications, such as CHCs. Discontinue Xulane prior to starting therapy with the combination drug regimen ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir [see  Contraindications (4)  ]  . Xulane can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen.



    5.5 High Blood Pressure



  Xulane is contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [see  Contraindications (4)  ]  . For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Xulane if blood pressure rises significantly.



 An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking hormonal contraceptives, and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestin.



    5.6 Gallbladder Disease



  Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among CHC users. Use of CHCs may also worsen existing gallbladder disease. A past history of CHC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent CHC use. Women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for CHC-related cholestasis.



    5.7 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects



  Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who take Xulane. CHCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion. In a 6-cycle clinical trial with norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system there were no clinically significant changes in fasting blood glucose from baseline to end of treatment.



 Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on hormonal contraceptives.



 Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using hormonal contraceptives.



    5.8 Headache



  If a woman taking Xulane develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Xulane if indicated.



 Consider discontinuation of Xulane in the case of increased frequency or severity of migraine during hormonal contraceptive use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event).



    5.9 Bleeding Irregularities



     Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting    



  Unscheduled (breakthrough) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in women using norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system. Consider non-hormonal causes and take adequate diagnostic measures to rule out malignancy, other pathology, or pregnancy in the event of unscheduled bleeding, as in the case of any abnormal vaginal bleeding. If pathology and pregnancy have been excluded, time or a change to another contraceptive product may resolve the bleeding.



 In the clinical trials, most women started their scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding on the fourth day of the drug-free interval, and the median duration of withdrawal bleeding was 5 to 6 days. On average, 26% of women per cycle had 7 or more total days of bleeding and/or spotting (this includes both scheduled and unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting). Three clinical studies of the efficacy of norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system in preventing pregnancy assessed scheduled and unscheduled bleeding [see  Clinical Studies (14)  ]  in 3,330 women who completed 22,155 cycles of exposure. A total of 36 (1.1%) of the women discontinued norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting.



 Table 2 summarizes the proportion of subjects who experienced unscheduled (breakthrough) bleeding/spotting by treatment cycle.

              Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea    
 

  In the event of amenorrhea, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one patch or started the patch on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.



 Some women may encounter amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuation of hormonal contraceptive use, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.



    5.10 Hormonal Contraceptive Use Before or During Early Pregnancy



  Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned, when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Discontinue Xulane use if pregnancy is confirmed.



 Administration of CHCs should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ]  .



    5.11 Depression



  Carefully observe women with a history of depression and discontinue Xulane if depression recurs to a serious degree.



    5.12 Carcinoma of Breasts and Cervix



  Xulane is contraindicated in women who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [see  Contraindications (4)  ]  .



 There is substantial evidence that CHCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that CHCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings.



 Some studies suggest that combination oral contraceptive use has been associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors.



    5.13 Effect on Binding Globulins



  The estrogen component of CHCs may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, sex hormone-binding globulin and cortisol-binding globulin. The dose of replacement thyroid hormone or cortisol therapy may need to be increased.



    5.14 Monitoring



  A woman who is taking hormonal contraceptive should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare.



    5.15 Hereditary Angioedema



  In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema.



    5.16 Chloasma



  Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while using Xulane.
