 Liver dysfunction has been reported in association with both active components of propoxyphene hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets. Propoxyphene therapy has been associated with abnormal liver function tests and, more rarely, with instances of reversible jaundice (including cholestatic jaundice). Hepatic necrosis may result from acute overdose of acetaminophen (see  OVERDOSAGE  ). In chronic ethanol abusers, this has been reported rarely with short-term use of acetaminophen dosages of 2.5 to 10 g/day. Fatalities have occurred.



 There have also been post-marketing reports of renal papillary necrosis associated with chronic acetaminophen use, particularly when the dosage is greater than recommended and when combined with aspirin. Subacute painful myopathy has been reported following chronic propoxyphene overdosage.

    BOXED WARNING: 

  

    WARNINGS  



 *  There have been numerous cases of accidental and intentional overdose with propoxyphene products either alone or in combination with other CNS depressants, including alcohol. Fatalities within the first hour of overdosage are not uncommon. Many of the propoxyphene-related deaths have occurred in patients with previous histories of emotional disturbances or suicidal ideation/attempts and/or concomitant administration of sedatives, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, antidepressants or other CNS-depressant drugs. Do not prescribe propoxyphene for patients who are suicidal or have a history of suicidal ideation. 
 *  The metabolism of propoxyphene may be altered by strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, grapefruit juice and verapamil) leading to enhanced propoxyphene plasma levels. Patients receiving propoxyphene and any CYP3A4 inhibitor should be carefully monitored for an extended period of time and dosage adjustments should be made if warranted (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interactions and WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION for further information).

 Propoxyphene hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets can cause serious side effects, including:



 See "What is the most important information I should know about propoxyphene hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets? 



 *  Serious breathing problems that can become life threatening. This is especially true if you already have a serious lung or breathing problem, or your body is not used to opioid pain medicines. This can happen even if you take propoxyphene hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Call your doctor or get medical help right away if: your breathing slows down you have shallow breathing (little chest movement with breathing) you feel faint, dizzy, confused, or you have any other unusual symptoms 
 *  Propoxyphene hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets can cause your blood pressure to drop. This can make you feel dizzy and faint if you get up too fast from sitting or lying down. Low blood pressure is also more likely to happen if you take other medicines that can also lower your blood pressure. Severe low blood pressure can happen if you lose blood or take certain other medicines. 
 *  Liver problems. Propoxyphene hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets contains acetaminophen. Acetaminophen can cause serious liver problems if you take more than the recommended dose. Do not take more propoxyphene hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets than prescribed. See "How should I take propoxyphene hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets?" Do not take any other medicines that contain acetaminophen while also taking propoxyphene hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets. Many products contain acetaminophen. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. Liver damage may happen even after symptoms go away. You can die from liver failure days later. Tell your doctor if you have any of these symptoms of a liver problem while taking propoxyphene hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets: nausea vomiting loss of appetite stomach area (abdominal pain) 
 *  Sleepiness. Propoxyphene hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets can cause sleepiness and may affect your ability to make decisions, think clearly, or react quickly. Do not drive, operate heavy machinery, or do other dangerous activities until you know how propoxyphene hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets affects you. 
 *  Propoxyphene hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets can cause physical dependence if you take it for more than a few weeks. Do not stop taking propoxyphene hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets all of a sudden. You could become sick with uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms (for example, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anxiety and shivering) because your body has become used to the medicine. Talk to your doctor about slowly stopping propoxyphene hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets to avoid getting sick with withdrawal symptoms. Physical dependence is not the same as drug addiction. Your doctor can tell you more about the differences between physical dependence and drug addiction. 
 *  Tell your doctor if you have any of these withdrawal symptoms while you slowly stop taking propoxyphene hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets. You may need to stop propoxyphene hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets more slowly.

    <Section id="S3" name="precautions">    PRECAUTIONS



   Tolerance and Physical Dependence



  Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Physical dependence is manifested by withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation of a drug or upon administration of an antagonist. Physical dependence and tolerance are not unusual during chronic opioid therapy.



 The opioid abstinence or withdrawal syndrome is characterized by some or all of the following: restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia and mydriasis. Other symptoms also may develop, including: irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate or heart rate. In general, opioids should not be abruptly discontinued (see  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Cessation of Therapy  ).



 If propoxyphene hydrochloride and acetaminophen is abruptly discontinued in a physically dependent patient, an abstinence syndrome may occur (see  DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE  ). If signs and symptoms of withdrawal occur, patients should be treated by reinstitution of opioid therapy followed by gradual tapered dose reduction of propoxyphene hydrochloride and acetaminophen combined with symptomatic support (see  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Cessation of Therapy  ).



    Use in Pancreatic/Biliary Tract Disease



  Propoxyphene hydrochloride and acetaminophen may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi and should be used with caution in patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis. Opioids like propoxyphene hydrochloride and acetaminophen may cause increases in the serum amylase level.



    Hepatic or Renal Impairment



  Insufficient information exists to make appropriate dosing recommendations regarding the use of either propoxyphene alone or in combination with acetaminophen in patients with hepatic or renal impairment as a function of degree of impairment. Higher plasma concentrations and/or delayed elimination may occur in case of impaired hepatic function and/or impaired renal function (see  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  ). If the drug is used in these patients, it should be used with caution because of the hepatic metabolism of propoxyphene and acetaminophen and renal excretion of their metabolites.



    Information for Patients/Caregivers



    *  1.  Patients should be advised to report pain and adverse experiences occurring during therapy. Individualization of dosage is essential to make optimal use of this medication. 
 *  2.  Patients should be advised not to adjust the dose of propoxyphene hydrochloride and acetaminophen without consulting the prescribing professional. 
 *  3.  Patients should be advised that propoxyphene hydrochloride and acetaminophen may impair mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks (e.g., driving, operating heavy machinery). 
 *  4.  Patients should not combine propoxyphene hydrochloride and acetaminophen with central nervous system depressants (e.g., sleep aids, tranquilizers) except by the orders of the prescribing physician, because additive effects may occur. 
 *  5.  Patients should be instructed not to consume alcoholic beverages, including prescription and over-the-counter medications that contain alcohol, while using propoxyphene hydrochloride and acetaminophen because of risk of serious adverse events including death. 
 *  6.  Women of childbearing potential who become, or are planning to become, pregnant should be advised to consult their physician regarding the effects of analgesics and other drug use during pregnancy on themselves and their unborn child. 
 *  7.  Patients should be advised that propoxyphene hydrochloride and acetaminophen is a potential drug of abuse. They should protect it from theft, and it should never be given to anyone other than the individual for whom it was prescribed. 
 *  8.  Patients should be advised that if they have been receiving treatment with propoxyphene hydrochloride and acetaminophen for more than a few weeks and cessation of therapy is indicated, it may be appropriate to taper the propoxyphene hydrochloride and acetaminophen dose, rather than abruptly discontinue it, due to the risk of precipitating withdrawal symptoms. Their physician can provide a dose schedule to accomplish a gradual discontinuation of the medication. 
 *  9.  Instruct patients not to consume any other medication that contain acetaminophen, including acetaminophen-based over-the-counter medications, while taking propoxyphene hydrochloride and acetaminophen. 
       Drug Interactions with Propoxyphene
 

  Propoxyphene is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4), therefore potential interactions may occur when propoxyphene is administered concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity.



 The metabolism of propoxyphene may be altered by strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, grapefruit juice and verapamil) leading to enhanced propoxyphene plasma levels. Coadministration with agents that induce CYP3A4 activity may reduce the efficacy of propoxyphene. Strong CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampin may lead to enhanced metabolite (norpropoxyphene) levels.



 Propoxyphene is also thought to possess CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzyme inhibiting properties and coadministration with drugs that rely on either of these enzymes for metabolism may result in increased pharmacologic or adverse effects of that drug. Severe neurologic signs, including coma, have occurred with concurrent use of carbamazepine (metabolized by CYP3A4).



 Increased risk of bleeding has been observed with warfarin-like agents when given along with propoxyphene; however, the mechanistic basis of this interaction is unknown.



    CNS Depressants



  Patients receiving narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other tranquilizers, sedative-hypnotics or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) concomitantly with propoxyphene hydrochloride and acetaminophen may exhibit an additive CNS depression. Interactive effects resulting in respiratory depression, hypotension, profound sedation or coma may result if these drugs are taken in combination with the usual dosage of propoxyphene hydrochloride and acetaminophen. When such combined therapy is contemplated, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced.



    Mixed Agonist/Antagonist Opioid Analgesics



  Agonist/antagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, butorphanol and buprenorphine) should be administered with caution to patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with a pure opioid agonist analgesic such as propoxyphene hydrochloride and acetaminophen. In this situation, mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of propoxyphene hydrochloride and acetaminophen and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms in these patients.



    Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)



  MAOIs have been reported to intensify the effects of at least one opioid drug causing anxiety, confusion and significant depression of respiration or coma. The use of propoxyphene hydrochloride and acetaminophen is not recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment.



    Drug Interactions with Acetaminophen



   Alcohol



  Hepatotoxicity has occurred in chronic alcoholics following various dose levels (moderate to excessive) of acetaminophen.



    Anticholinergics



  The onset of acetaminophen effect may be delayed or decreased slightly, but the ultimate pharmacological effect is not significantly affected by anticholinergics.



    Oral Contraceptives



  Increase in glucuronidation resulting in increased plasma clearance and a decreased half-life of acetaminophen.



    Beta Blockers (Propranolol)



  Propranolol appears to inhibit the enzyme systems responsible for the glucuronidation and oxidation of acetaminophen. Therefore, the pharmacologic effects of acetaminophen may be increased.



    Loop Diuretics



  The effects of the loop diuretic may be decreased because acetaminophen may decrease renal prostaglandin excretion and decrease plasma renin activity.



    Lamotrigine



  Serum lamotrigine concentrations may be reduced, producing a decrease in therapeutic effects.



    Probenecid



  Probenecid may increase the therapeutic effectiveness of acetaminophen slightly.



    Zidovudine



  The pharmacologic effects of zidovudine may be decreased because of enhanced nonhepatic or renal clearance of zidovudine.



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility



  The mutagenic and carcinogenic potential of propoxyphene and acetaminophen alone and in combination have not been evaluated.



 In animal studies there was no effect of propoxyphene on mating behavior, fertility, duration of gestation or parturition when rats were fed propoxyphene as a component of their daily diet at estimated daily propoxyphene intake up to 8-fold greater than the maximum human equivalent dose (HED) based on body surface area comparison. At this highest dose, fetal weight and survival on postnatal day 4 was reduced. Acetaminophen has not been studied in animals for effects on fertility and the effects on human fertility are unknown.



    Pregnancy



   Risk summary



   Pregnancy Category C



  There are no adequate and well controlled studies of propoxyphene with acetaminophen in pregnant women. While there are limited data in the published literature, adequate animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with propoxyphene or acetaminophen. Therefore, it is not known whether propoxyphene or acetaminophen can affect reproduction or cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Propoxyphene with acetaminophen should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.



    Clinical Considerations



  Acetaminophen, propoxyphene and its major metabolite, norpropoxyphene, cross the human placenta. Neonates whose mothers have taken opiates chronically may exhibit respiratory depression or withdrawal symptoms.



    Data



  In published animal reproduction studies, no teratogenic effects occurred in offspring born to pregnant rats or rabbits that received propoxyphene during organogenesis. Pregnant animals received propoxyphene doses approximately 10-fold (rats) and 4-fold (rabbits) the maximum recommended human dose (based on mg/m  2  body surface area comparison).



    Nursing Mothers



  Propoxyphene, norpropoxyphene (major metabolite) and acetaminophen are excreted in human milk. Published studies of nursing mothers using propoxyphene detected no adverse effects in nursing infants. Based on a study of six mother-infant pairs, an exclusively breastfed infant receives approximately 2% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose. Norpropoxyphene is renally excreted and renal clearance is lower in neonates than in adults. Therefore, it is possible that prolonged maternal propoxyphene use could result in norpropoxyphene accumulation in a breastfed infant. Watch breast-feeding infants for signs of sedation including poor feeding, somnolence or respiratory depression. Caution should be exercised when propoxyphene hydrochloride and acetaminophen is administered to a nursing woman.



    Pediatric Patients



  Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.



    Elderly Patients



  Clinical studies of propoxyphene hydrochloride and acetaminophen did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. However, post-marketing reports suggest that patients over the age of 65 may be more susceptible to CNS-related side effects. Therefore, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Decreased total daily dosage should be considered (see  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  ).
</Section>
    <Section id="S4" name="warnings">    WARNINGS



   Risk of Overdose



   There have been numerous cases of accidental and intentional overdose with propoxyphene products either alone or in combination with other CNS depressants, including alcohol. Fatalities within the first hour of overdosage are not uncommon. Many of the propoxyphene-related deaths have occurred in patients with previous histories of emotional disturbances or suicidal ideation/attempts and/or concomitant administration of sedatives, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, antidepressants or other CNS-depressant drugs. Do not prescribe propoxyphene for patients who are suicidal or have a history of suicidal ideation.  



    Respiratory Depression



  Respiratory depression is the chief hazard from all opioid agonist preparations. Respiratory depression occurs most frequently in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration. Propoxyphene hydrochloride and acetaminophen should be used with extreme caution in patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and in patients having substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia or preexisting respiratory depression. In such patients, even usual therapeutic doses of propoxyphene hydrochloride and acetaminophen may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea. In these patients alternative non-opioid analgesics should be considered, and opioids should be employed only under careful medical supervision at the lowest effective dose.



    Hypotensive Effect



  Propoxyphene hydrochloride and acetaminophen, like all opioid analgesics, may cause severe hypotension in an individual whose ability to maintain blood pressure has been compromised by a depleted blood volume, or after concurrent administration with drugs such as phenothiazines or other agents which compromise vasomotor tone. Propoxyphene hydrochloride and acetaminophen may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients. Propoxyphene hydrochloride and acetaminophen, like all opioid analgesics, should be administered with caution to patients in circulatory shock, since vasodilatation produced by the drug may further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure.



    Head Injury and Increased Intracranial Pressure



  The respiratory depressant effects of narcotics and their capacity to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of head injury, other intracranial lesions or a preexisting increase in intracranial pressure. Furthermore, narcotics produce adverse reactions which may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injuries.



    Drug Interactions



  The concomitant use of propoxyphene and CNS depressants, including alcohol, can result in potentially serious adverse events including death. Because of its added depressant effects, propoxyphene should be prescribed with caution for those patients whose medical condition requires the concomitant administration of sedatives, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, antidepressants, or other CNS-depressant drugs.



    Usage in Ambulatory Patients



  Propoxyphene may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks, such as driving a car or operating machinery. The patient should be cautioned accordingly.



    Use with Other Acetaminophen-Containing Agents



  Due to the potential for acetaminophen hepatotoxicity at doses higher than the recommended dose, Propoxyphene hydrochloride and acetaminophen should not be used concomitantly with other acetaminophen-containing products.



    Use with Alcohol



  Hepatotoxicity and severe hepatic failure occurred in chronic alcoholics following therapeutic doses of acetaminophen. Patients should be cautioned about the concomitant use of propoxyphene products and alcohol because of potentially serious CNS-additive effects of these agents that can lead to death.
