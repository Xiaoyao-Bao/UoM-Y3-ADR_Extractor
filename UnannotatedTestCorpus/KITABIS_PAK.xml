  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 Tobramycin inhalation solution was studied in two clinical studies in 258 cystic fibrosis patients ranging in age from 6 to 48 years. Patients received tobramycin inhalation solution in alternating periods of 28 days on and 28 days off drug in addition to their standard cystic fibrosis therapy for a total of 24 weeks. Adverse reactions reported in these studies are described below:



 *  The most frequent adverse reactions in the tobramycin inhalation arm were cough, pharyngitis, and increased sputum (see  Table 1  ). 
 *  Thirty-three patients (13%) treated with tobramycin inhalation solution complained of voice alteration compared to 17 (7%) placebo patients. Voice alteration was more common in the on-drug periods. 
 *  Eight patients from the tobramycin inhalation solution group (3%) reported tinnitus compared to no placebo patients. All episodes were transient, resolved without discontinuation of the tobramycin inhalation solution treatment regimen, and were not associated with loss of hearing in audiograms. 
      Table 1  lists the percent of patients with selected adverse reactions that occurred in &gt;5% of tobramycin inhalation solution patients during the two Phase III studies.

         Following are selected adverse reactions that occurred in less than or equal to 5% of patients treated with tobramycin inhalation solution:
 

   Ear and labyrinth disorders  



 Tinnitus



   Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders  



 Myalgia



   Infections and infestations  



 Laryngitis



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of tobramycin inhalation solution. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Ear and labyrinth disorders  



 Hearing loss: Some of these reports occurred in patients with previous or concomitant treatment with systemic aminoglycosides. Patients with hearing loss frequently reported tinnitus.  [see WARNINGS and Precautions (  5.2  )]  



   Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders  



 Hypersensitivity, pruritus, urticaria, rash



   Nervous system disorders  



 Aphonia, dysgeusia



   Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders  



 Bronchospasm  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )]  , oropharyngeal pain

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *   Bronchospasm: Can occur with inhalation of tobramycin inhalation solution. Treat as medically appropriate, if it occurs (  5.1  ). 
 *   Ototoxicity: Tinnitus and hearing loss have been reported in patients receiving tobramycin inhalation solution. . If noted, manage as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution (  5.2  ). 
 *   Nephrotoxicity: Has been associated with aminoglycosides as a class. If nephrotoxicity develops, manage the patient as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution(  5.3  ). 
 *   Neuromuscular Disorders: Aminoglycosides may aggravate muscle weakness because of a potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. (  5.4  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Bronchospasm



  Bronchospasm can occur with inhalation of tobramycin inhalation solution. In clinical studies with tobramycin inhalation solution, changes in FEV1measured after the inhaled dose were similar in tobramycin inhalation solution and placebo groups. Bronchospasm that occurs during the use of tobramycin inhalation solution should be treated as medically appropriate.



    5.2 Ototoxicity



  Transient tinnitus occurred in eight tobramycin inhalation solution treated patients versus no placebo patients in the clinical studies. Tinnitus may be a sentinel symptom of ototoxicity, and therefore the onset of this symptom warrants further clinical investigation. In postmarketing experience, patients receiving tobramycin inhalation solution have reported hearing loss. Ototoxicity, manifested as both auditory and vestibular toxicity, has been reported with parenteral aminoglycosides. Vestibular toxicity may be manifested by vertigo, ataxia or dizziness. Patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction should be closely monitored when taking tobramycin inhalation solution. Monitoring might include obtaining audiometric evaluations and serum tobramycin levels. If ototoxicity is noted, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution [see Adverse Reactions (  6.2  )].  



    5.3 Nephrotoxicity



  Nephrotoxicity was not seen during clinical studies with tobramycin inhalation solution but has been associated with aminoglycosides as a class. Patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs along with tobramycin inhalation solution should have serum concentrations of tobramycin and laboratory measurements of renal function obtained at the discretion of the treating physician. If nephrotoxicity develops, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing tobramycin inhalation solution.



    5.4 Neuromuscular Disorders



  Aminoglycosides, including tobramycin, may aggravate muscle weakness because of a potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. Neuromuscular blockade, respiratory failure, and prolonged respiratory paralysis may occur more commonly in patients with underlying neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson's disease. Prolonged respiratory paralysis may also occur in patients receiving neuromuscular blocking agents. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary.



    5.5 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycosides cross the placenta, and streptomycin has been associated with several reports of total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness in pediatric patients exposed in utero  . The risk with inhaled tobramycin is less well characterized. Patients who use tobramycin inhalation solution during pregnancy, or become pregnant while taking tobramycin inhalation solution should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.



    5.6 Concomitant Use of Systemic Aminoglycosides



  Patients receiving concomitant tobramycin inhalation solution and parenteral aminoglycoside therapy should be monitored as clinically appropriate for toxicities associated with aminoglycosides as a class. Serum tobramycin levels should be monitored.
