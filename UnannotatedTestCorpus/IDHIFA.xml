  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The safety evaluation of single-agent IDHIFA is based on 214 patients with relapsed or refractory AML who were assigned to receive 100 mg daily  [see Clinical Studies (  14.1  )]  . The median duration of exposure to IDHIFA was 4.3 months (range 0.3 to 23.6). The 30-day and 60-day mortality rates observed with IDHIFA were 4.2% (9/214) and 11.7% (25/214), respectively.



 The most common adverse reactions (&gt;=20%) of any grade were nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, elevated bilirubin and decreased appetite.



 Serious adverse reactions were reported in 77.1% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions (&gt;=2%) were leukocytosis (10%), diarrhea (6%), nausea (5%), vomiting (3%), decreased appetite (3%), tumor lysis syndrome (5%), and differentiation syndrome (8%). Differentiation syndrome events characterized as serious included pyrexia, renal failure acute, hypoxia, respiratory failure, and multi-organ failure.



 Overall, 92 of 214 patients (43%) required a dose interruption due to an adverse reaction; the most common adverse reactions leading to dose interruption were differentiation syndrome (4%) and leukocytosis (3%). Ten of 214 patients (5%) required a dose reduction due to an adverse reaction; no adverse reaction required dose reduction in more than 2 patients. Thirty-six of 214 patients (17%) permanently discontinued IDHIFA due to an adverse reaction; the most common adverse reaction leading to permanent discontinuation was leukocytosis (1%).



 Adverse reactions reported in the trial are shown in  Table 2  .

           Elevated Bilirubin  
 

 IDHIFA may interfere with bilirubin metabolism through inhibition of UGT1A1  [see Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )]  . Thirty-seven percent of patients (80/214) experienced total bilirubin elevations &gt;=2 x ULN at least one time. Of those patients who experienced total bilirubin elevations &gt;=2 x ULN, 35% had elevations within the first month of treatment, and 89% had no concomitant elevation of transaminases or other severe adverse events related to liver disorders. No patients required a dose reduction for hyperbilirubinemia; treatment was interrupted in 3.7% of patients, for a median of 6 days. Three patients (1.4%) discontinued IDHIFA permanently due to hyperbilirubinemia.



   Noninfectious Leukocytosis  



 IDHIFA can induce myeloid proliferation resulting in a rapid increase in white blood cell count.



   Tumor Lysis Syndrome  



 IDHIFA can induce myeloid proliferation resulting in a rapid reduction in tumor cells which may pose a risk for tumor lysis syndrome.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: DIFFERENTIATION SYNDROME

  WARNING: DIFFERENTIATION SYNDROME

    Patients treated with IDHIFA have experienced symptoms of differentiation syndrome, which can be fatal if not treated. Symptoms may include fever, dyspnea, acute respiratory distress, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural or pericardial effusions, rapid weight gain or peripheral edema, lymphadenopathy, bone pain, and hepatic, renal, or multi-organ dysfunction. If differentiation syndrome is suspected, initiate corticosteroid therapy and hemodynamic monitoring until symptom resolution    [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  ) and Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  .  



   EXCERPT:     WARNING: DIFFERENTIATION SYNDROME  



   See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.  



   Patients treated with IDHIFA have experienced symptoms of differentiation syndrome, which can be fatal if not treated. If differentiation syndrome is suspected, initiate corticosteroid therapy and hemodynamic monitoring until symptom resolution (  5.1  ,   6.1  ).  



 
</Section>
    <Section id="S3" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



  EXCERPT:   Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: IDHIFA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise of the potential risk to a fetus (  5.2  ,  8.1  ,  8.3  ).



  
 

   5.1 Differentiation Syndrome



  In the clinical trial, 14% of patients treated with IDHIFA experienced differentiation syndrome, which may be life-threatening or fatal if not treated. Differentiation syndrome is associated with rapid proliferation and differentiation of myeloid cells. While there is no diagnostic test for differentiation syndrome, symptoms in patients treated with IDHIFA included acute respiratory distress represented by dyspnea and/or hypoxia (68%) and need for supplemental oxygen (76%); pulmonary infiltrates (73%) and pleural effusion (45%); renal impairment (70%); fever (36%); lymphadenopathy (33%); bone pain (27%); peripheral edema with rapid weight gain (21%); and pericardial effusion (18%). Hepatic, renal, and multi-organ dysfunction have also been observed. Differentiation syndrome has been observed with and without concomitant hyperleukocytosis, and as early as 10 days and at up to 5 months after IDHIFA initiation.



 If differentiation syndrome is suspected, initiate oral or intravenous corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone 10 mg every 12 hours) and hemodynamic monitoring until improvement. Taper corticosteroids only after resolution of symptoms. Symptoms of differentiation syndrome may recur with premature discontinuation of corticosteroid treatment. If severe pulmonary symptoms requiring intubation or ventilator support, and/or renal dysfunction persist for more than 48 hours after initiation of corticosteroids, interrupt IDHIFA until signs and symptoms are no longer severe [see Dosage and Administration (  2.3  )]  . Hospitalization for close observation and monitoring of patients with pulmonary and/or renal manifestation is recommended.



    5.2 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  Based on animal embryo-fetal toxicity studies, IDHIFA can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal embryo-fetal toxicity studies, enasidenib caused embryo-fetal toxicities starting at 0.1 times the steady state clinical exposure based on the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) at the recommended human dose. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with IDHIFA and for at least 1 month after the last dose of IDHIFA. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with IDHIFA and for at least 1 month after the last dose of IDHIFA. Pregnant women, patients becoming pregnant while receiving IDHIFA, or male patients with pregnant female partners should be apprised of the potential risk to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  ,  8.3  )]  .
