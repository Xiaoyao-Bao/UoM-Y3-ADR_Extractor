  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 The most frequent adverse reaction associated with Activase in all approved indications is bleeding.



     Bleeding  



     Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS)  



 In clinical studies in patients with AIS (Studies 1 and 2) the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage, especially symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, was higher in Activase-treated patients than in placebo patients. A dose-finding study of Activase suggested that doses greater than 0.9 mg/kg may be associated with an increased incidence of intracranial hemorrhage.



 The incidence of all-cause 90-day mortality, intracranial hemorrhage, and new ischemic stroke following Activase treatment compared to placebo are presented in  Table 3  as a combined safety analysis (n=624) for Studies 1 and 2. These data indicate a significant increase in intracranial hemorrhage following Activase treatment, particularly symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 36 hours. There was no increase in the incidences of 90-day mortality or severe disability in Activase-treated patients compared to placebo.

      New Ischemic Stroke (3-months)            17 (5.4%)             18 (5.8%)                1.00           
          Bleeding events other than intracranial hemorrhage were noted in the studies of AIS and were consistent with the general safety profile of Activase. In Studies 1 and 2, the frequency of bleeding requiring red blood cell transfusions was 6.4% for Activase-treated patients compared to 3.8% for placebo (p = 0.19).
 

 Although exploratory analyses of Studies 1 and 2 suggest that severe neurological deficit (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS &gt; 22]) at presentation was associated with an increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage, efficacy results suggest a reduced but still favorable clinical outcome for these patients.



     Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI)  



 For the 3-hour infusion regimen in the treatment of AMI, the incidence of significant internal bleeding (estimated as &gt; 250 mL blood loss) has been reported in studies in over 800 patients (  Table 4  ). These data do not include patients treated with the Activase accelerated infusion.

         A dose of 150 mg or greater should not be used in the treatment of AMI because it has been associated with an increase in intracranial bleeding.
 

     Pulmonary Embolism (PE)  



 For acute massive pulmonary embolism, bleeding events were consistent with the general safety profile observed with Activase treatment of AMI patients receiving the 3-hour infusion regimen.



   6.2 Post-Marketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Activase. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions are frequent sequelae of the underlying disease, and the effect of Activase on the incidence of these events is unknown.



     Acute Ischemic Stroke:  Cerebral edema, cerebral herniation, seizure, new ischemic stroke, embolism. These events may be life threatening and may lead to death.



     Acute Myocardial Infarction:  Arrhythmias, AV block, cardiogenic shock, heart failure, cardiac arrest, recurrent ischemia, myocardial reinfarction, myocardial rupture, electromechanical dissociation, pericardial effusion, pericarditis, mitral regurgitation, cardiac tamponade, thromboembolism, pulmonary edema. These events may be life threatening and may lead to death. Nausea and/or vomiting, hypotension and fever have also been reported.



     Pulmonary Embolism:  Pulmonary reembolization, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, thromboembolism, hypotension. These events may be life threatening and may lead to death. Fever has also been reported.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Increases the risk of bleeding. Avoid intramuscular injections. Monitor for bleeding. If serious bleeding occurs, discontinue Activase. (  5.1  ) 
 *  Monitor patients during and for several hours after infusion for hypersensitivity. If signs of hypersensitivity develop, discontinue Activase. (  5.2  ) 
 *  Consider the risk of reembolization from the lysis of underlying deep venous thrombi in patients with pulmonary embolism. (  5.3  ) 
 *  Cholesterol embolism has been reported rarely in patients treated with thrombolytic agents. (  5.4  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Bleeding



  Activase can cause significant, sometimes fatal, internal or external bleeding, especially at arterial and venous puncture sites. Avoid intramuscular injections and trauma to the patient while on Activase. Perform venipunctures carefully and only as required. To minimize bleeding from noncompressible sites, avoid internal jugular and subclavian venous punctures. If an arterial puncture is necessary during Activase infusion, use an upper extremity vessel that is accessible to manual compression, apply pressure for at least 30 minutes, and monitor the puncture site closely.



 Because of the higher risk of intracranial hemorrhage in patients treated for acute ischemic stroke, limit treatment to facilities that can provide timely access to appropriate evaluation and management of intracranial hemorrhage.



 Fatal cases of hemorrhage associated with traumatic intubation in patients administered Activase have been reported.



 Aspirin and heparin have been administered concomitantly with and following infusions of Activase in the management of acute myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism, but the concomitant administration of heparin and aspirin with and following infusions of Activase for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke during the first 24 hours after symptom onset has not been investigated. Because heparin, aspirin, or Activase may cause bleeding complications, carefully monitor for bleeding, especially at arterial puncture sites. Hemorrhage can occur 1 or more days after administration of Activase, while patients are still receiving anticoagulant therapy.



 If serious bleeding occurs, terminate the Activase infusion and treat appropriately. In the following conditions, the risks of bleeding with Activase therapy for all approved indications are increased and should be weighed against the anticipated benefits:



 *  Recent major surgery or procedure, (e.g., coronary artery bypass graft, obstetrical delivery, organ biopsy, previous puncture of noncompressible vessels) 
 *  Cerebrovascular disease 
 *  Recent intracranial hemorrhage 
 *  Recent gastrointestinal or genitourinary bleeding 
 *  Recent trauma 
 *  Hypertension: systolic BP above 175 mm Hg or diastolic BP above 110 mm Hg 
 *  Acute pericarditis 
 *  Subacute bacterial endocarditis 
 *  Hemostatic defects including those secondary to severe hepatic or renal disease 
 *  Significant hepatic dysfunction 
 *  Pregnancy 
 *  Diabetic hemorrhagic retinopathy, or other hemorrhagic ophthalmic conditions 
 *  Septic thrombophlebitis or occluded AV cannula at seriously infected site 
 *  Advanced age [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.5)  ]  
 *  Patients currently receiving anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin sodium) 
 *  Any other condition in which bleeding constitutes a significant hazard or would be particularly difficult to manage because of its location. 
       5.2 Hypersensitivity
 

  Hypersensitivity, including urticarial / anaphylactic reactions, have been reported after administration of Activase (e.g., laryngeal edema, rash and shock). Rare fatal outcome for hypersensitivity was reported. Angioedema has been observed during and up to 2 hours after Activase infusion in patients treated for acute ischemic stroke and acute myocardial infarction. In many cases, patients received concomitant angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [see  Drug Interactions (7)  ]  .



 Monitor patients treated with Activase during and for several hours after infusion for hypersensitivity. If signs of hypersensitivity occur, e.g. anaphylactoid reaction or angioedema develops, discontinue the Activase infusion and promptly institute appropriate therapy (e.g., antihistamines, intravenous corticosteroids, epinephrine).



    5.3 Thromboembolism



   The use of thrombolytics can increase the risk of thrombo-embolic events in patients with high likelihood of left heart thrombus, such as patients with mitral stenosis or atrial fibrillation. Activase has not been shown to treat adequately underlying deep vein thrombosis in patients with PE. Consider the possible risk of re-embolization due to the lysis of underlying deep venous thrombi in this setting.  



    5.4 Cholesterol Embolization



  Cholesterol embolism has been reported rarely in patients treated with thrombolytic agents; the true incidence is unknown. Cholesterol embolism may present with livedo reticularis, "purple toe" syndrome, acute renal failure, gangrenous digits, hypertension, pancreatitis, myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction, spinal cord infarction, retinal artery occlusion, bowel infarction, or rhabdomyolysis and can be fatal. It is associated with invasive vascular procedures (e.g., cardiac catheterization, angiography, vascular surgery) and/or anticoagulant therapy.



    5.5 Coagulation Tests May Be Unreliable during Activase Therapy



  Coagulation tests and measures of fibrinolytic activity may be unreliable during Activase therapy, unless specific precautions are taken to prevent in vitro artifacts. When present in blood at pharmacologic concentrations, Activase remains active under in vitro conditions, which can result in degradation of fibrinogen in blood samples removed for analysis.
