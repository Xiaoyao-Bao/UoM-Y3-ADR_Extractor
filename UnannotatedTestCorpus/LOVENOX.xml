  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  The following serious adverse reactions are also discussed in other sections of the labeling:



 *  Spinal/epidural hematomas [see  Boxed Warning  and  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  
 *  Increased Risk of Hemorrhage [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  
 *  Thrombocytopenia [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.5)  ]  
    Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.
 

 During clinical development for the approved indications, 15,918 patients were exposed to enoxaparin sodium. These included 1,228 for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis following abdominal surgery in patients at risk for thromboembolic complications, 1,368 for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis following hip or knee replacement surgery, 711 for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis in medical patients with severely restricted mobility during acute illness, 1,578 for prophylaxis of ischemic complications in unstable angina and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, 10,176 for treatment of acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction, and 857 for treatment of deep vein thrombosis with or without pulmonary embolism. Enoxaparin sodium doses in the clinical trials for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis following abdominal or hip or knee replacement surgery or in medical patients with severely restricted mobility during acute illness ranged from 40 mg subcutaneously once daily to 30 mg subcutaneously twice daily. In the clinical studies for prophylaxis of ischemic complications of unstable angina and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction doses were 1 mg/kg every 12 hours and in the clinical studies for treatment of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction enoxaparin sodium doses were a 30 mg intravenous bolus followed by 1 mg/kg every 12 hours subcutaneously.



     Hemorrhage  



 The following rates of major bleeding events have been reported during clinical trials with Lovenox (see Tables 2 to 7).



 Table 2: Major Bleeding Episodes Following Abdominal and Colorectal SurgeryBleeding complications were considered major: (1) if the hemorrhage caused a significant clinical event, or (2) if accompanied by a hemoglobin decrease &gt;=2 g/dL or transfusion of 2 or more units of blood products. Retroperitoneal, intraocular, and intracranial hemorrhages were always considered major.

          NOTE: At no time point were the 40 mg once a day pre-operative and the 30 mg every 12 hours postoperative hip replacement surgery prophylactic regimens compared in clinical trials. Injection site hematomas during the extended prophylaxis period after hip replacement surgery occurred in 9% of the Lovenox patients versus 1.8% of the placebo patients.
 

 Table 4: Major Bleeding Episodes in Medical Patients with Severely Restricted Mobility During Acute IllnessBleeding complications were considered major: (1) if the hemorrhage caused a significant clinical event, (2) if the hemorrhage caused a decrease in hemoglobin of &gt;=2 g/dL or transfusion of 2 or more units of blood products. Retroperitoneal and intracranial hemorrhages were always considered major although none were reported during the trial.

             Elevations of Serum Aminotransferases  
 

 Asymptomatic increases in aspartate (AST [SGOT]) and alanine (ALT [SGPT]) aminotransferase levels greater than three times the upper limit of normal of the laboratory reference range have been reported in up to 6.1% and 5.9% of patients, respectively, during treatment with Lovenox. Similar significant increases in aminotransferase levels have also been observed in patients and healthy volunteers treated with heparin and other low molecular weight heparins. Such elevations are fully reversible and are rarely associated with increases in bilirubin.



 Since aminotransferase determinations are important in the differential diagnosis of myocardial infarction, liver disease, and pulmonary emboli, elevations that might be caused by drugs like Lovenox should be interpreted with caution.



     Local Reactions  



 Mild local irritation, pain, hematoma, ecchymosis, and erythema may follow subcutaneous injection of Lovenox.



     Adverse Reactions in Patients Receiving Lovenox for Prophylaxis or Treatment of DVT, PE  



 Other adverse reactions that were thought to be possibly or probably related to treatment with Lovenox, heparin, or placebo in clinical trials with patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery, abdominal or colorectal surgery, or treatment for DVT and that occurred at a rate of at least 2% in the Lovenox group, are provided below (see Tables 8 to 11).

                 Adverse Events in Lovenox-Treated Patients with Unstable Angina or Non-Q-Wave Myocardial Infarction  
 

 Non-hemorrhagic clinical events reported to be related to Lovenox therapy occurred at an incidence of &lt;=1%.



 Non-major hemorrhagic events, primarily injection site ecchymoses and hematomas, were more frequently reported in patients treated with subcutaneous Lovenox than in patients treated with intravenous heparin.



 Serious adverse events with Lovenox or heparin in a clinical trial in patients with unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction that occurred at a rate of at least 0.5% in the Lovenox group are provided below (see  Table 12  ).

             Adverse Reactions in Lovenox-Treated Patients with Acute ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction  
 

 In a clinical trial in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, thrombocytopenia occurred at a rate of 1.5%.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Lovenox. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 There have been reports of epidural or spinal hematoma formation with concurrent use of Lovenox and spinal/epidural anesthesia or spinal puncture. The majority of patients had a postoperative indwelling epidural catheter placed for analgesia or received additional drugs affecting hemostasis such as NSAIDs. Many of the epidural or spinal hematomas caused neurologic injury, including long-term or permanent paralysis.



 Local reactions at the injection site (e.g. nodules, inflammation, oozing), systemic allergic reactions (e.g. pruritus, urticaria  ,  anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions including shock), vesiculobullous rash, cases of hypersensitivity cutaneous vasculitis, purpura, skin necrosis (occurring at either the injection site or distant from the injection site), thrombocytosis, and thrombocytopenia with thrombosis  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.5)  ]  have been reported.



 Cases of hyperkalemia have been reported. Most of these reports occurred in patients who also had conditions that tend toward the development of hyperkalemia (e.g., renal dysfunction, concomitant potassium-sparing drugs, administration of potassium, hematoma in body tissues). Very rare cases of hyperlipidemia have also been reported, with one case of hyperlipidemia, with marked hypertriglyceridemia, reported in a diabetic pregnant woman; causality has not been determined.



 Cases of headache, hemorrhagic anemia, eosinophilia, alopecia, hepatocellular and cholestatic liver injury have been reported



 Osteoporosis has also been reported following long-term therapy.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: SPINAL/EPIDURAL HEMATOMAS

    WARNING: SPINAL/EPIDURAL HEMATOMAS  

    Epidural or spinal hematomas may occur in patients who are anticoagulated with low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) or heparinoids and are receiving neuraxial anesthesia or undergoing spinal puncture. These hematomas may result in long-term or permanent paralysis. Consider these risks when scheduling patients for spinal procedures. Factors that can increase the risk of developing epidural or spinal hematomas in these patients include:  



 *  Use of indwelling epidural catheters 
 *  Concomitant use of other drugs that affect hemostasis, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), platelet inhibitors, other anticoagulants 
 *  A history of traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal punctures 
 *  A history of spinal deformity or spinal surgery 
 *  Optimal timing between the administration of Lovenox and neuraxial procedures is not known 
      Monitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment. If neurological compromise is noted, urgent treatment is necessary.  
 

   Consider the benefits and risks before neuraxial intervention in patients anticoagulated or to be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)   and   Drug Interactions (7)  ]  .

   5.1 Increased Risk of Hemorrhage



  Cases of epidural or spinal hemorrhage and subsequent hematomas have been reported with the use of Lovenox and epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or spinal puncture procedures, resulting in long-term or permanent paralysis. The risk of these events is higher with the use of postoperative indwelling epidural catheters, with the concomitant use of additional drugs affecting hemostasis such as NSAIDs, with traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture, or in patients with a history of spinal surgery or spinal deformity [see  Boxed Warning  ,  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  and  Drug Interactions (7)  ]  .



 To reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of enoxaparin sodium and epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of enoxaparin [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  . Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best performed when the anticoagulant effect of enoxaparin is low; however, the exact timing to reach a sufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known.



 Placement or removal of a catheter should be delayed for at least 12 hours after administration of lower doses (30 mg once or twice daily or 40 mg once daily) of Lovenox, and at least 24 hours after the administration of higher doses (0.75 mg/kg twice daily, 1 mg/kg twice daily, or 1.5 mg/kg once daily) of Lovenox. Anti-Xa levels are still detectable at these time points, and these delays are not a guarantee that neuraxial hematoma will be avoided. Patients receiving the 0.75 mg/kg twice-daily dose or the 1 mg/kg twice-daily dose should not receive the second enoxaparin dose in the twice-daily regimen to allow a longer delay before catheter placement or removal. Likewise, although a specific recommendation for timing of a subsequent Lovenox dose after catheter removal cannot be made, consider delaying this next dose for at least four hours, based on a benefit-risk assessment considering both the risk for thrombosis and the risk for bleeding in the context of the procedure and patient risk factors. For patients with creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/minute, additional considerations are necessary because elimination of enoxaparin is more prolonged; consider doubling the timing of removal of a catheter, at least 24 hours for the lower prescribed dose of Lovenox (30 mg once daily) and at least 48 hours for the higher dose (1 mg/kg/day) [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  .



 Should the physician decide to administer anticoagulation in the context of epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or lumbar puncture, frequent monitoring must be exercised to detect any signs and symptoms of neurological impairment such as midline back pain, sensory and motor deficits (numbness or weakness in lower limbs), bowel and/or bladder dysfunction. Instruct patients to report immediately if they experience any of the above signs or symptoms. If signs or symptoms of spinal hematoma are suspected, initiate urgent diagnosis and treatment including consideration for spinal cord decompression even though such treatment may not prevent or reverse neurological sequelae.



 Use Lovenox with extreme caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage, such as bacterial endocarditis, congenital or acquired bleeding disorders, active ulcerative and angiodysplastic gastrointestinal disease, hemorrhagic stroke, or shortly after brain, spinal, or ophthalmological surgery, or in patients treated concomitantly with platelet inhibitors.



 Major hemorrhages including retroperitoneal and intracranial bleeding have been reported. Some of these cases have been fatal.



 Bleeding can occur at any site during therapy with Lovenox. An unexplained fall in hematocrit or blood pressure should lead to a search for a bleeding site.



    5.2 Percutaneous Coronary Revascularization Procedures



  To minimize the risk of bleeding following the vascular instrumentation during the treatment of unstable angina, non-Q-wave myocardial infarction and acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, adhere precisely to the intervals recommended between Lovenox doses. It is important to achieve hemostasis at the puncture site after PCI. In case a closure device is used, the sheath can be removed immediately. If a manual compression method is used, sheath should be removed 6 hours after the last intravenous/subcutaneous Lovenox. If the treatment with enoxaparin sodium is to be continued, the next scheduled dose should be given no sooner than 6 to 8 hours after sheath removal. The site of the procedure should be observed for signs of bleeding or hematoma formation [see  Dosage and Administration (2.1)  ]  .



    5.3 Use of Lovenox with Concomitant Medical Conditions



  Lovenox should be used with care in patients with a bleeding diathesis, uncontrolled arterial hypertension or a history of recent gastrointestinal ulceration, diabetic retinopathy, renal dysfunction and hemorrhage.



    5.4 History of Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia



   Use of Lovenox in patients with a history of immune-mediated HIT within the past 100 days or in the presence of circulating antibodies is contraindicated [see  Contraindications (4)  ]  . Circulating antibodies may persist for several years.  



  In patients with a history of HIT, Lovenox should only be used if more than 100 days have elapsed since the prior HIT episode and no circulating antibodies are present. Because HIT may still occur in these circumstances, the decision to use Lovenox in such a case must be made only after a careful benefit-risk assessment and after non-heparin alternative treatments are considered.  



    5.5 Thrombocytopenia



  Thrombocytopenia can occur with the administration of Lovenox.



 Moderate thrombocytopenia (platelet counts between 100,000/mm  3  and 50,000/mm  3  ) occurred at a rate of 1.3% in patients given Lovenox, 1.2% in patients given heparin, and 0.7% in patients given placebo in clinical trials.



 Platelet counts less than 50,000/mm  3  occurred at a rate of 0.1% in patients given Lovenox, in 0.2% of patients given heparin, and 0.4% of patients given placebo in the same trials.



 Thrombocytopenia of any degree should be monitored closely. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm  3  , Lovenox should be discontinued. Cases of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis have also been observed in clinical practice. Some of these cases were complicated by organ infarction, limb ischemia, or death [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.4)  ]  .



    5.6 Interchangeability with Other Heparins



  Lovenox cannot be used interchangeably (unit for unit) with heparin or other low molecular weight heparins as they differ in manufacturing process, molecular weight distribution, anti-Xa and anti-IIa activities, units, and dosage. Each of these medicines has its own instructions for use.



    5.7 Pregnant Women with Mechanical Prosthetic Heart Valves



  The use of Lovenox for thromboprophylaxis in pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves has not been adequately studied. In a clinical study of pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves given enoxaparin (1 mg/kg twice daily) to reduce the risk of thromboembolism, 2 of 8 women developed clots resulting in blockage of the valve and leading to maternal and fetal death. Although a causal relationship has not been established these deaths may have been due to therapeutic failure or inadequate anticoagulation. No patients in the heparin/warfarin group (0 of 4 women) died. There also have been isolated postmarketing reports of valve thrombosis in pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves while receiving enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis. Women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves may be at higher risk for thromboembolism during pregnancy and, when pregnant, have a higher rate of fetal loss from stillbirth, spontaneous abortion, and premature delivery. Therefore, frequent monitoring of peak and trough anti-Factor Xa levels, and adjusting of dosage may be needed [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.6)  ]  .



    5.8 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative



   Lovenox multiple-dose vials are not approved for use in neonates or infants.  



  Serious and fatal adverse reactions including "gasping syndrome" can occur in neonates and low birth weight infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including Lovenox multiple-dose vials. The "gasping syndrome" is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which serious adverse reactions may occur is not known (Lovenox multiple-dose vials contain 15 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL) [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.4)  ].    



  Because benzyl alcohol may cross the placenta, if anticoagulation with Lovenox is needed during pregnancy, use the preservative-free formulations where possible [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ]  .  



    5.9 Laboratory Tests



  Periodic complete blood counts, including platelet count, and stool occult blood tests are recommended during the course of treatment with Lovenox. When administered at recommended prophylaxis doses, routine coagulation tests such as Prothrombin Time (PT) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) are relatively insensitive measures of Lovenox activity and, therefore, unsuitable for monitoring. Anti-Factor Xa may be used to monitor the anticoagulant effect of Lovenox in patients with significant renal impairment. If during Lovenox therapy abnormal coagulation parameters or bleeding should occur, anti-Factor Xa levels may be used to monitor the anticoagulant effects of Lovenox [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  .
