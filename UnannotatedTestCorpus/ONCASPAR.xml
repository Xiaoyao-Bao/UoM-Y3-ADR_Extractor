  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

    *     Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed cannot be directly compared to rates in other clinical trials and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. 
        First-Line ALL    
 

 *     The data presented below are derived from 2 studies in patients with standard-risk ALL who received ONCASPAR as a component of first-line multi-agent chemotherapy. Study 1 was a randomized (1:1), active-controlled study that enrolled 118 patients, with a median age of 4.7 years (1.1-9.9 years), of whom 54% were males and 65% White, 14% Hispanic, 8% Black, 8% Asian, and 6% other. Of the 59 patients in Study 1 who were randomized to ONCASPAR, 48 patients (81%) received all 3 planned doses of ONCASPAR, 6 (10%) received 2 doses, 4 (7%) received 1 dose, and 1 patient (2%) did not receive the assigned treatment. Study 2 is an ongoing, multi-factorial design study in which all patients received ONCASPAR as a component of various multi-agent chemotherapy regimens; interim safety data are available for 2,770 patients. Study participants had a median age of 4 years (1-10 years), and were 55% male, 68% White, 18% Hispanic, 4% Black, 3% Asian, and 7% other. Per protocol, the schedule of ONCASPAR varied by treatment arm, with intermittent doses of ONCASPAR for up to 10 months. 
 *     In Study 1, detailed safety information was collected for pre-specified adverse reactions identified as asparaginase-induced adverse reactions and for grade 3 and 4 non-hematologic adverse reactions according to the Children's Cancer Group (CCG) Toxicity and Complication Criteria. The per-patient incidence, by treatment arm, for these selected adverse reactions occurring at a severity of grade 3 or 4 are presented in  Table 1  below:

        *     Safety data were collected in Study 2 only for National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTC) version 2.0, grade 3 and 4 non-hematologic toxicities. In this study, the per-patient incidence for the following adverse reactions occurring during treatment courses in which patients received ONCASPAR were: elevated transaminases, 11%; coagulopathy, 7%; hyperglycemia, 5%; CNS thrombosis/hemorrhage, 2%; pancreatitis, 2%; clinical allergic reaction, 1%; and hyperbilirubinemia, 1%. There were 3 deaths due to pancreatitis. 
        Previously Treated ALL    
 

 *     Adverse reaction information was obtained from 5 clinical trials that enrolled a total of 174 patients with relapsed ALL who received ONCASPAR as a single agent or in combination with multi-agent chemotherapy. The toxicity profile of ONCASPAR in patients with previously treated relapsed ALL is similar to that reported above with the exception of clinical allergic reactions (see  Table 2  ). The most common adverse reactions of ONCASPAR were clinical allergic reactions, elevated transaminases, hyperbilirubinemia, and coagulopathies. The most common serious adverse events due to ONCASPAR treatment were thrombosis (4%), hyperglycemia requiring insulin therapy (3%), and pancreatitis (1%). 
      6.2 Allergic Reactions
     *     Allergic reactions include the following: bronchospasm, hypotension, laryngeal edema, local erythema or swelling, systemic rash, and urticaria. 
        First-Line ALL    
 

 *     Among 58 ONCASPAR-treated patients enrolled in Study 1, clinical allergic reactions were reported in 2 patients (3%). One patient experienced a grade 1 allergic reaction and the other grade 3 hives; both occurred during the first delayed intensification phase of the study (see  Table 2  ). 
        Previously Treated ALL    
 

 *     Among 62 patients with relapsed ALL and prior hypersensitivity reactions to asparaginase, 35 patients (56%) had a history of clinical allergic reactions to native Escherichia (E.) coli L-asparaginase, and 27 patients (44%) had a history of clinical allergic reactions to both native E. coli and native Erwinia L-asparaginase. Twenty (32%) of these 62 patients experienced clinical allergic reactions to ONCASPAR (see  Table 2  ). 
 *     Among 112 patients with relapsed ALL with no prior hypersensitivity reactions to asparaginase, 11 patients (10%) experienced clinical allergic reactions to ONCASPAR (see  Table 2  ).

              6.3 Immunogenicity
     *     As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity, defined as development of binding and/or neutralizing antibodies to the product. 
 *     In Study 1, ONCASPAR-treated patients were assessed for evidence of binding antibodies using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. The incidence of protocol-specified "high-titer" antibody formation was 2% in Induction (n=48), 10% in Delayed Intensification 1 (n=50), and 11% in Delayed Intensification 2 (n=44). There is insufficient information to determine whether the development of antibodies is associated with an increased risk of clinical allergic reactions, altered pharmacokinetics, or loss of anti-leukemic efficacy. 
 *     The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay, and the observed incidence of antibody positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including sample handling, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. Therefore, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to ONCASPAR with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *    Anaphylaxis or serious allergic reactions - Observe patients for one hour after administration. Discontinue ONCASPAR in patients with serious allergic reactions. (   5.1   ) 
 *    Thrombosis - Discontinue ONCASPAR in patients with serious thrombotic events. (   5.2   ) 
 *    Pancreatitis - Evaluate patients with abdominal pain for pancreatitis. Discontinue ONCASPAR in patients with pancreatitis. (   5.3   ) 
 *    Glucose intolerance - Monitor serum glucose. (   5.4   ) 
 *    Coagulopathy - Perform appropriate monitoring. (   5.5   ) 
 *    Hepatotoxicity - Perform appropriate monitoring. (   5.6   ) 
    
 

   5.1 Anaphylaxis and Serious Allergic Reactions



    *     Anaphylaxis and serious allergic reactions can occur in patients receiving ONCASPAR. The risk of serious allergic reactions is higher in patients with known hypersensitivity to other forms of L-asparaginase. Observe patients for 1 hour after administration of ONCASPAR in a setting with resuscitation equipment and other agents necessary to treat anaphylaxis (for example, epinephrine, oxygen, intravenous steroids, antihistamines). Discontinue ONCASPAR in patients with serious allergic reactions. 
       5.2 Thrombosis
 

    *     Serious thrombotic events, including sagittal sinus thrombosis can occur in patients receiving ONCASPAR. Discontinue ONCASPAR in patients with serious thrombotic events. 
       5.3 Pancreatitis
 

    *     Pancreatitis can occur in patients receiving ONCASPAR. Evaluate patients with abdominal pain for evidence of pancreatitis. Discontinue ONCASPAR in patients with pancreatitis. 
       5.4 Glucose Intolerance
 

    *     Glucose intolerance can occur in patients receiving ONCASPAR. In some cases, glucose intolerance is irreversible. Monitor serum glucose. 
       5.5 Coagulopathy
 

    *     Increased prothrombin time, increased partial thromboplastin time, and hypofibrinogenemia can occur in patients receiving ONCASPAR. Monitor coagulation parameters at baseline and periodically during and after treatment. Initiate treatment with fresh-frozen plasma to replace coagulation factors in patients with severe or symptomatic coagulopathy. 
       5.6 Hepatotoxicity and Abnormal Liver Function
 

    *     Hepatotoxicity and abnormal liver function, including elevations of AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin (direct and indirect), and depression of serum albumin, and plasma fibrinogen can occur. Perform appropriate monitoring.
