  The following serious adverse reactions are described in more detail elsewhere in the labeling:

 *  Seizures [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  
 *  Anaphylaxis [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.4)  ]  
    
 

   EXCERPT:   The most common adverse events (incidence &gt;=2% and at a rate greater than the placebo rate) for AMPYRA were urinary tract infection, insomnia, dizziness, headache, nausea, asthenia, back pain, balance disorder, multiple sclerosis relapse, paresthesia, nasopharyngitis, constipation, dyspepsia, and pharyngolaryngeal pain (  6.1  ).

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

 In three placebo-controlled clinical trials of up to 14 weeks duration, 4% (15/400) of patients treated with AMPYRA 10 mg twice daily experienced one or more adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, compared to 2% (5/238) of placebo-treated patients. The adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of at least 2 patients treated with AMPYRA and that led to discontinuation more frequently compared to placebo were headache (AMPYRA 0.5%, placebo 0%), balance disorder (AMPYRA 0.5%, placebo 0%), dizziness (AMPYRA 0.5%, placebo 0%), and confusional state (AMPYRA 0.3%, placebo 0%).

 Table 1 lists adverse reactions that occurred in &gt;=2% of patients treated with AMPYRA 10 mg twice daily, and more frequently than in placebo-treated patients, in controlled clinical trials.

        Other Adverse Reactions  
 

 

 AMPYRA has been evaluated in a total of 1,952 subjects, including 917 MS patients. A total of 741 patients have been treated with AMPYRA for over six months, 501 for over one year and 352 for over two years. The experience in open-label clinical trials is consistent with the safety profile observed in the placebo-controlled clinical trials. As in controlled clinical trials, a dose-dependent increase in the incidence of seizures has been observed in open-label clinical trials with AMPYRA in patients with MS as follows: AMPYRA 10 mg twice daily 0.41 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval 0.13-0.96); dalfampridine 15 mg twice daily 1.7 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval 0.21-6.28).

 

 

   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse event has been identified during post-marketing experience with dalfampridine. Because adverse events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: vomiting.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">   5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

   EXCERPT:    *  AMPYRA can cause seizures; the risk of seizures increases with increasing AMPYRA doses; discontinue AMPYRA and do not restart if a seizure occurs (  5.1  ) 
 *  Avoid concomitant use with other forms of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP, fampridine), since the active ingredient is the same (  5.3  ) 
 *  AMPYRA can cause anaphylaxis. Discontinue and do not restart AMPYRA if this occurs (  5.4  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Seizures

  AMPYRA can cause seizures. Increased incidence of seizures has been observed at 20 mg twice daily (2 times the maximum recommended dosage) in controlled clinical studies of 9-14 weeks duration with dalfampridine in patients with MS. In open label extension trials in MS patients, the incidence of seizures during treatment with dalfampridine 15 mg twice daily (1.7/100PY) was over 4 times higher than the incidence during treatment with 10 mg twice daily (0.4/100PY). In the post-marketing period seizures have been reported. The majority of seizures occurred at the recommended dose and in patients without a history of seizures, and generally within days to weeks of starting therapy.

 AMPYRA has not been evaluated in patients with a history of seizures or with evidence of epileptiform activity on an EEG, as these patients were excluded from clinical trials. The risk of seizures in patients with epileptiform activity on an EEG is unknown, and could be substantially higher than that observed in AMPYRA clinical studies. Permanently discontinue AMPYRA in patients who have a seizure while on treatment. AMPYRA is contraindicated in patients with a history of seizures [see  Contraindications (4)  ]  .

    5.2 Renal Impairment

  AMPYRA is eliminated through the kidneys primarily as unchanged drug [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ].  

 Because patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCl &lt;=50mL/min) would require a dose lower than 10 mg twice daily and no strength smaller than 10 mg is available, AMPYRA is contraindicated in these patients [see  Contraindications (4)  ]  .

 In patients with mild renal impairment (CrCl 51-80 mL/min), AMPYRA plasma levels may approach those seen at a dose of 15 mg twice daily, a dose that may be associated with an increased risk of seizures [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  .

    5.3 Concurrent Treatment with Other Forms of 4-Aminopyridine

  Avoid concomitant use with other forms of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP, fampridine) since the active ingredient is the same. Instruct patients to discontinue use of any product containing 4-aminopyridine prior to initiating treatment with AMPYRA in order to reduce the potential for dose-related adverse reactions.

    5.4 Anaphylaxis

  AMPYRA can cause anaphylaxis and severe allergic reactions. Signs and symptoms have included respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and or tongue. AMPYRA is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to AMPYRA or 4-aminopyridine. Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis and instruct them to discontinue AMPYRA and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur.
