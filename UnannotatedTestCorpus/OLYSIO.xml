  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



     OLYSIO in Combination with Sofosbuvir  



 The safety profile of OLYSIO in combination with sofosbuvir in patients with HCV genotype 1 infection with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A) or without cirrhosis is based on pooled data from the Phase 2 COSMOS trial and the Phase 3 OPTIMIST-1 and OPTIMIST-2 trials which included 317 subjects who received OLYSIO with sofosbuvir (without RBV) for 12 or 24 weeks  [see  Clinical Studies (14.2)  ]  .



 Table 4 lists adverse events (all grades) that occurred with at least 10% frequency among subjects receiving 12 or 24 weeks of treatment with OLYSIO 150 mg once daily in combination with sofosbuvir 400 mg once daily without RBV. The overall safety profile appeared similar among cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic subjects  [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ].  



 The majority of the adverse events reported were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were reported in 4% and 13% of subjects receiving 12 or 24 weeks of OLYSIO with sofosbuvir, respectively. Serious adverse events were reported in 2% and 3% of subjects receiving 12 or 24 weeks of OLYSIO with sofosbuvir, respectively. One percent and 6% of subjects receiving 12 or 24 weeks of OLYSIO with sofosbuvir, respectively, discontinued treatment due to adverse events.

             Rash and Photosensitivity  
 

 In trials of OLYSIO in combination with sofosbuvir, rash (including photosensitivity reactions) was observed in 12% of OLYSIO-treated subjects receiving 12 weeks of treatment compared to 16% of OLYSIO-treated subjects receiving 24 weeks of treatment.



 Most of the rash events in OLYSIO-treated subjects were of mild or moderate severity (Grade 1 or 2). Among 317 subjects, Grade 3 rash was reported in one subject (&lt;1%), leading to treatment discontinuation; none of the subjects experienced Grade 4 rash.



 Most photosensitivity reactions were of mild severity (Grade 1); Grade 2 photosensitivity reactions were reported in 2 of 317 subjects (&lt;1%). No Grade 3 or 4 photosensitivity reactions were reported and none of the subjects discontinued treatment due to photosensitivity reactions.



     Laboratory Abnormalities  



 Among subjects who received OLYSIO in combination with sofosbuvir, the most common Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities were amylase and lipase elevations (Table 5). Most elevations in amylase and lipase were transient and of mild or moderate severity. Amylase and lipase elevations were not associated with pancreatitis.

              OLYSIO in Combination with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV  
 

 The safety profile of OLYSIO in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV in patients with HCV genotype 1 infection is based on pooled data from three Phase 3 trials (QUEST-1, QUEST-2 and PROMISE)  [see  Clinical Studies (14.3)  ]  . These trials included a total of 1178 subjects who received OLYSIO or placebo in combination with 24 or 48 weeks of Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV. Of the 1178 subjects, 781 subjects were randomized to receive OLYSIO 150 mg once daily for 12 weeks and 397 subjects were randomized to receive placebo once daily for 12 weeks.



 In the pooled Phase 3 safety data, the majority of the adverse reactions reported during 12 weeks treatment with OLYSIO in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV were Grade 1 to 2 in severity. Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were reported in 23% of subjects receiving OLYSIO in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV versus 25% of subjects receiving placebo in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 2% of subjects receiving OLYSIO in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV and in 3% of subjects receiving placebo in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV. Discontinuation of OLYSIO or placebo due to adverse reactions occurred in 2% and 1% of subjects receiving OLYSIO with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV and subjects receiving placebo with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV, respectively.



 Table 6 lists adverse reactions (all Grades) that occurred with at least 3% higher frequency among subjects with HCV genotype 1 infection receiving OLYSIO 150 mg once daily in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV, compared to subjects receiving placebo in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV, during the first 12 weeks of treatment in the pooled Phase 3 trials in subjects who were treatment-naive or who had previously relapsed after Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV therapy.

             Rash and Photosensitivity  
 

 In the Phase 3 clinical trials of OLYSIO or placebo in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV, rash (including photosensitivity reactions) was observed in 28% of OLYSIO-treated subjects compared to 20% of placebo-treated subjects during the 12 weeks of treatment with OLYSIO or placebo in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV. Fifty-six percent (56%) of rash events in the OLYSIO group occurred in the first 4 weeks, with 42% of cases occurring in the first 2 weeks. Most of the rash events in OLYSIO-treated subjects were of mild or moderate severity (Grade 1 or 2). Severe (Grade 3) rash occurred in 1% of OLYSIO-treated subjects and in none of the placebo-treated subjects. There were no reports of life-threatening (Grade 4) rash. Discontinuation of OLYSIO or placebo due to rash occurred in 1% of OLYSIO-treated subjects, compared to less than 1% of placebo-treated subjects. The frequencies of rash and photosensitivity reactions were higher in subjects with higher simeprevir exposures.



 All subjects enrolled in the Phase 3 trials were directed to use sun protection measures. In these trials, adverse reactions under the specific category of photosensitivity were reported in 5% of OLYSIO-treated subjects compared to 1% of placebo-treated subjects during the 12 weeks of treatment with OLYSIO or placebo in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV. Most photosensitivity reactions in OLYSIO-treated subjects were of mild or moderate severity (Grade 1 or 2). Two OLYSIO-treated subjects experienced photosensitivity reactions which resulted in hospitalization. No life-threatening photosensitivity reactions were reported.



     Dyspnea  



 During the 12 weeks of treatment with OLYSIO or placebo in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV, dyspnea was reported in 12% of OLYSIO-treated subjects compared to 8% of placebo-treated subjects (all grades; pooled Phase 3 trials). All dyspnea events reported in OLYSIO-treated subjects were of mild or moderate severity (Grade 1 or 2). There were no Grade 3 or 4 dyspnea events reported and no subjects discontinued treatment with OLYSIO due to dyspnea. Sixty-one percent (61%) of dyspnea events occurred in the first 4 weeks of treatment with OLYSIO.



     Laboratory Abnormalities  



 Among subjects who received OLYSIO or placebo plus Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV, there were no differences between treatment groups for the following laboratory parameters: hemoglobin, neutrophils, platelets, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, amylase, or serum creatinine. Laboratory abnormalities that were observed at a higher incidence in OLYSIO-treated subjects than in placebo-treated subjects are listed in Table 7.

          Elevations in bilirubin were predominately mild to moderate (Grade 1 or 2) in severity, and included elevation of both direct and indirect bilirubin. Elevations in bilirubin occurred early after treatment initiation, peaking by study Week 2, and were rapidly reversible upon cessation of OLYSIO. Bilirubin elevations were generally not associated with elevations in liver transaminases. The frequency of elevated bilirubin was higher in subjects with higher simeprevir exposures.
 

     Adverse Reactions in HCV/HIV-1 Co-infection  



 OLYSIO in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV was studied in 106 subjects with HCV genotype 1/HIV-1 co-infection (C212). The safety profile in HCV/HIV co-infected subjects was generally comparable to HCV mono-infected subjects.



     Adverse Reactions in HCV Genotype 4 Infection  



 OLYSIO in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV was studied in 107 subjects with HCV genotype 4 infection (RESTORE). The safety profile of OLYSIO in subjects with HCV genotype 4 infection was comparable to subjects with HCV genotype 1 infection.



     Adverse Reactions in East Asian Subjects  



 OLYSIO in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV was studied in a Phase 3 trial conducted in China and South Korea in treatment-naive subjects with chronic HCV genotype 1 infection (TIGER). The safety profile of OLYSIO in East Asian subjects was similar to that of the pooled Phase 3 population from global trials; however, a higher incidence of the laboratory abnormality hyperbilirubinemia was observed in patients receiving 150 mg OLYSIO plus Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV compared to patients receiving placebo plus Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV. Elevation of total bilirubin (all grades) was observed in 66% (99/151) of subjects treated with 150 mg OLYSIO plus Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV and in 26% (40/152) of subjects treated with placebo plus Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV. Bilirubin elevations were mainly Grade 1 or Grade 2. Grade 3 elevations in bilirubin were observed in 9% (13/151) of subjects treated with 150 mg OLYSIO plus Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV and in 1% (2/152) of subjects treated with placebo plus Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV. There were no Grade 4 elevations in bilirubin. The bilirubin elevations were not associated with increases in liver transaminases and were reversible after the end of treatment  [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.6)  and  Clinical Studies (14.3)  ].  



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been reported during post approval use of OLYSIO. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship between drug exposure and these adverse reactions.



     Cardiac Disorders:  Serious symptomatic bradycardia has been reported in patients taking amiodarone who initiated treatment with a sofosbuvir-containing regimen  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  and  Drug Interactions (7.3)  ].  



     Hepatobiliary Disorders:  hepatic decompensation, hepatic failure  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  .

   Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation has been reported in HCV/HBV coinfected patients who were undergoing or had completed treatment with HCV direct-acting antivirals, and who were not receiving HBV antiviral therapy. Some cases have resulted in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death. Cases have been reported in patients who are HBsAg positive and also in patients with serologic evidence of resolved HBV infection (i.e., HBsAg negative and anti-HBc positive). HBV reactivation has also been reported in patients receiving certain immunosuppressant or chemotherapeutic agents; the risk of HBV reactivation associated with treatment with HCV direct-acting antivirals may be increased in these patients.  



  HBV reactivation is characterized as an abrupt increase in HBV replication manifesting as a rapid increase in serum HBV DNA level. In patients with resolved HBV infection, reappearance of HBsAg can occur. Reactivation of HBV replication may be accompanied by hepatitis, i.e., increases in aminotransferase levels and, in severe cases, increases in bilirubin levels, liver failure, and death can occur.  



  Test all patients for evidence of current or prior HBV infection by measuring HBsAg and anti-HBc before initiating HCV treatment with OLYSIO. In patients with serologic evidence of HBV infection, monitor for clinical and laboratory signs of hepatitis flare or HBV reactivation during HCV treatment with OLYSIO and during post-treatment follow-up. Initiate appropriate patient management for HBV infection as clinically indicated.  



    5.2 Serious Symptomatic Bradycardia When Coadministered with Sofosbuvir and Amiodarone



  Postmarketing cases of symptomatic bradycardia and cases requiring pacemaker intervention have been reported when amiodarone was coadministered with a sofosbuvir-containing regimen. A fatal cardiac arrest was reported in a patient taking amiodarone who was coadministered a sofosbuvir-containing regimen (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir). Bradycardia has generally occurred within hours to days, but cases have been observed up to 2 weeks after initiating HCV treatment. Patients also taking beta blockers, or those with underlying cardiac comorbidities and/or advanced liver disease may be at increased risk for symptomatic bradycardia with coadministration of amiodarone. Bradycardia generally resolved after discontinuation of HCV treatment. The mechanism for this effect is unknown.



 Coadministration of amiodarone with OLYSIO in combination with sofosbuvir is not recommended. For patients taking amiodarone who have no other alternative treatment options, and who will be coadministered OLYSIO and sofosbuvir:



 *  Counsel patients about the risk of serious symptomatic bradycardia. 
 *  Cardiac monitoring in an in-patient setting for the first 48 hours of coadministration is recommended, after which outpatient or self-monitoring of the heart rate should occur on a daily basis through at least the first 2 weeks of treatment. 
    Patients who are taking sofosbuvir in combination with OLYSIO who need to start amiodarone therapy due to no other alternative treatment options should undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above.
 

 Due to amiodarone's long elimination half-life, patients discontinuing amiodarone just prior to starting sofosbuvir in combination with OLYSIO should also undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above.



 Patients who develop signs or symptoms of bradycardia should seek medical evaluation immediately. Symptoms may include near-fainting or fainting, dizziness or lightheadedness, malaise, weakness, excessive tiredness, shortness of breath, chest pain, confusion or memory problems [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  and  Drug Interactions (7.3)  ]  .



    5.3 Hepatic Decompensation and Hepatic Failure



  Hepatic decompensation and hepatic failure, including fatal cases, have been reported postmarketing in patients treated with OLYSIO in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV or in combination with sofosbuvir. Most cases were reported in patients with advanced and/or decompensated cirrhosis who are at increased risk for hepatic decompensation or hepatic failure. Because these events have been reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made; and a causal relationship between treatment with OLYSIO and these events has not been established [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ]  .



 OLYSIO is not recommended for patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C) [see  Dosage and Administration (2.5)  and  Use in Specific Populations (8.8)  ].  



 In clinical trials of OLYSIO, modest increases in bilirubin levels were observed without impacting hepatic function [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Postmarketing cases of hepatic decompensation with markedly elevated bilirubin levels have been reported. Monitor liver chemistry tests before and as clinically indicated during OLYSIO combination therapy. Patients who experience an increase in total bilirubin to greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal should be closely monitored:



 *  Patients should be instructed to contact their healthcare provider if they have onset of fatigue, weakness, lack of appetite, nausea and vomiting, jaundice or discolored feces. 
 *  Discontinue OLYSIO if elevation in bilirubin is accompanied by liver transaminase increases or clinical signs and symptoms of hepatic decompensation. 
       5.4 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions Associated with Combination Treatment
 

  Because OLYSIO is used in combination with other antiviral drugs for the treatment of chronic HCV infection, consult the prescribing information for these drugs before starting therapy with OLYSIO. Warnings and Precautions related to these drugs also apply to their use in OLYSIO combination treatment.



    5.5 Photosensitivity



  Photosensitivity reactions have been observed with OLYSIO combination therapy. Serious photosensitivity reactions resulting in hospitalization have been observed with OLYSIO in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Photosensitivity reactions occurred most frequently in the first 4 weeks of treatment, but can occur at any time during treatment. Photosensitivity may present as an exaggerated sunburn reaction, usually affecting areas exposed to light (typically the face, "V" area of the neck, extensor surfaces of the forearms, and dorsa of the hands). Manifestations may include burning, erythema, exudation, blistering, and edema.



 Use sun protective measures and limit sun exposure during treatment with OLYSIO. Avoid use of tanning devices during treatment with OLYSIO. Discontinuation of OLYSIO should be considered if a photosensitivity reaction occurs and patients should be monitored until the reaction has resolved. If a decision is made to continue OLYSIO in the setting of a photosensitivity reaction, expert consultation is advised.



    5.6 Rash



  Rash has been observed with OLYSIO combination therapy [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Rash occurred most frequently in the first 4 weeks of treatment, but can occur at any time during treatment. Severe rash and rash requiring discontinuation of OLYSIO have been reported in subjects receiving OLYSIO in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV. Most of the rash events in OLYSIO-treated patients were of mild or moderate severity [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Patients with mild to moderate rashes should be followed for possible progression of rash, including the development of mucosal signs (e.g., oral lesions, conjunctivitis) or systemic symptoms. If the rash becomes severe, OLYSIO should be discontinued. Patients should be monitored until the rash has resolved.



    5.7 Sulfa Allergy



  OLYSIO contains a sulfonamide moiety. In subjects with a history of sulfa allergy (n=16), no increased incidence of rash or photosensitivity reactions has been observed. However, there are insufficient data to exclude an association between sulfa allergy and the frequency or severity of adverse reactions observed with the use of OLYSIO.



    5.8 Risk of Adverse Reactions or Reduced Therapeutic Effect Due to Drug Interactions



  Coadministration of OLYSIO with substances that are moderate or strong inducers or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) is not recommended as this may lead to significantly lower or higher exposure of simeprevir, respectively, which may result in reduced therapeutic effect or adverse reactions [see  Drug Interactions (7)  and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  .
