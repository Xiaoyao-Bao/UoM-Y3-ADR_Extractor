  Kionex  (r)  Suspension may cause some degree of gastric irritation. Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and constipation may occur especially if high doses are given. Also, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and significant sodium retention may occur. (See  WARNINGS  ) Occasionally diarrhea develops. Large doses in elderly individuals may cause fecal impaction (See  PRECAUTIONS  ). Rare instances of colonic necrosis have been reported. Intestinal obstruction due to concretions of aluminum hydroxide, when used in combination with sodium polystyrene sulfonate, has been reported.



 The following events have been reported from worldwide post marketing experience with sodium polystyrene sulfonate powder:



 *    fecal impaction following rectal administration, particularly in children; 
 *    gastrointestinal concretions (bezoars) following oral administration; 
 *    gastrointestinal tract ulceration or necrosis which could lead to intestinal perforation; and, 
 *    rare cases of acute bronchitis and/or bronchopneumonia associated with inhalation of particles of polystyrene sulfonate.

  Caution is advised when sodium polystyrene sulfonate is administered to patients who cannot tolerate even a small increase in sodium loads (i.e., severe congestive heart failure, severe hypertension, or marked edema). In such instances, compensatory restriction of sodium intake from other sources may be indicated.



 Caution is advised when Kionex  (r)  Suspension is administered to patients with end stage diabetic renal disease.



  Kionex  (r)  Suspension should not be administered to patients following surgery until normal bowel function resumes.  



  Precautions should be taken to ensure the use of adequate volumes of sodium-free cleansing enemas after rectal administration.  



 In the event of clinically significant constipation, treatment with Kionex  (r)  Suspension should be discontinued until normal bowel motion is resumed. Magnesium-containing laxatives should not be used (see  PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions  ).



    Drug Interactions



   Antacids:  The simultaneous oral administration of sodium polystyrene sulfonate with non-absorbable cation-donating antacids and laxatives may reduce the resin's potassium exchange capability.



    Non-absorbable cation-donating antacids and laxatives:  Systemic alkalosis has been reported after cation exchange resins were administered orally in combination with nonabsorbable cation-donating antacids and laxatives such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum carbonate. Magnesium hydroxide should not be administered with sodium polystyrene sulfonate. One case of grand mal seizure has been reported in a patient with chronic hypocalcemia of renal failure who was given sodium polystyrene sulfonate with magnesium hydroxide as a laxative.



 Intestinal obstruction due to concretions of aluminum hydroxide when used in combination with sodium polystyrene sulfonate has been reported.



    Digitalis:  The toxic effects of digitalis on the heart, especially various ventricular arrhythmias and A-V nodal dissociation, are likely to be exaggerated by hypokalemia, even in the face of serum digoxin concentrations in the "normal range" (See  WARNINGS  ).



    Sorbitol:  Concomitant use of additional sorbitol with Kionex  (r)  Suspension is not recommended.



    Lithium:  Kionex  (r)  Suspension may decrease absorption of lithium.



    Thyroxine:  Kionex  (r)  Suspension may decrease absorption of thyroxine.



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility



  Studies have not been performed.



    Pregnancy Category C



  Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with sodium polystyrene sulfonate. It is also not known whether sodium polystyrene sulfonate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.



    Nursing Mothers



  It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when sodium polystyrene sulfonate is administered to a nursing woman.



    Pediatric Use



  The effectiveness of Kionex  (r)  Suspension in pediatric patients has not been established. The use of Kionex  (r)  Suspension is contraindicated in neonates and especially in premature infants.  In children, particular care should be observed with rectal administration, as excessive dosage or inadequate dilution could result in impaction of the resin. Precaution should be taken to ensure the use of adequate volumes of sodium-free cleansing enemas after rectal administration.

   Alternative Therapy in Severe Hyperkalemia:



  Since the effective lowering of serum potassium with sodium polystyrene sulfonate may take hours to days, treatment with this drug alone may be insufficient to rapidly correct severe hyperkalemia associated with states of rapid tissue breakdown (e.g., burns and renal failure) or hyperkalemia so marked as to constitute a medical emergency. Therefore, other definitive measures, including dialysis, should always be considered and may be imperative.



    Hypokalemia:



  Serious potassium deficiency can occur from sodium polystyrene sulfonate therapy. The effect must be carefully controlled by frequent serum potassium determinations within each 24 hour period. Since intracellular potassium deficiency is not always reflected by serum potassium levels, the level at which treatment with sodium polystyrene sulfonate should be discontinued must be determined individually for each patient. Important aids in making this determination are the patient's clinical condition and electrocardiogram. Early clinical signs of severe hypokalemia include a pattern of irritable confusion and delayed thought processes.



 Electrocardiographically, severe hypokalemia is often associated with a lengthened Q-T interval, widening, flattening, or inversion of the T wave, and prominent U waves. Also, cardiac arrhythmias may occur, such as premature atrial, nodal, and ventricular contractions, and supraventricular and ventricular tachycardias. The toxic effects of digitalis are likely to be exaggerated. Marked hypokalemia can also be manifested by severe muscle weakness, at times extending into frank paralysis.



    Electrolyte Disturbances:



  Like all cation-exchange resins, sodium polystyrene sulfonate is not totally selective (for potassium) in its actions, and small amounts of other cations such as magnesium and calcium can also be lost during treatment. Accordingly, patients receiving sodium polystyrene sulfonate should be monitored for all applicable electrolyte disturbances.



    Systemic Alkalosis:



  Systemic alkalosis has been reported after cation-exchange resins were administered orally in combination with nonabsorbable cation-donating antacids and laxatives such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum carbonate. Magnesium hydroxide should not be administered with sodium polystyrene sulfonate. One case of grand mal seizure has been reported in a patient with chronic hypocalcemia of renal failure who was given sodium polystyrene sulfonate with magnesium hydroxide as a laxative.
