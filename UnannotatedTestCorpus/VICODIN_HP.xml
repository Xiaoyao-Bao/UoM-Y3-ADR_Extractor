  The most frequently reported adverse reactions are lightheadedness, dizziness, sedation, nausea and vomiting. These effects seem to be more prominent in ambulatory than in nonambulatory patients, and some of these adverse reactions may be alleviated if the patient lies down.



 Other adverse reactions include:



   Central Nervous System

  Drowsiness, mental clouding, lethargy, impairment of mental and physical performance, anxiety, fear, dysphoria, psychic dependence, mood changes.



   Gastrointestinal System

  Prolonged administration of VICODIN HP Tablets may produce constipation.



   Genitourinary System

  Ureteral spasm, spasm of vesical sphincters and urinary retention have been reported with opiates.



   Respiratory Depression

  Hydrocodone bitartrate may produce dose-related respiratory depression by acting directly on the brain stem respiratory centers (see    OVERDOSAGE    ).



   Special Senses

  Cases of hearing impairment or permanent loss have been reported predominantly in patients with chronic overdose.



   Dermatological

  Skin rash, pruritus.



   The following adverse drug events may be borne in mind as potential effects of acetaminophen: allergic reactions, rash, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis.



 Potential effects of high dosage are listed in the    OVERDOSAGE    section.

  BOXED WARNING 

    Hepatotoxicity  



 Acetaminophen has been associated with cases of acute liver failure, at times resulting in liver transplant and death. Most of the cases of liver injury are associated with the use of acetaminophen at doses that exceed 4000 milligrams per day, and often involve more than one acetaminophen-containing product.

   General



   Special Risk Patients



  As with any narcotic analgesic agent, VICODIN HP Tablets should be used with caution in elderly or debilitated patients, and those with severe impairment of hepatic or renal function, hypothyroidism, Addison's disease, prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture. The usual precautions should be observed and the possibility of respiratory depression should be kept in mind.



    Cough Reflex



  Hydrocodone suppresses the cough reflex; as with all narcotics, caution should be exercised when VICODIN HP Tablets are used postoperatively and in patients with pulmonary disease.



    Information for Patients/Caregivers



    *  Do not take VICODIN HP Tablets if you are allergic to any of its ingredients. 
   *  If you develop signs of allergy such as a rash or difficulty breathing stop taking VICODIN HP Tablets and contact your healthcare provider immediately. 
   *  Do not take more than 4000 milligrams of acetaminophen per day. Call your doctor if you took more than the recommended dose. 
    Hydrocodone, like all narcotics, may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery; patients should be cautioned accordingly. Alcohol and other CNS depressants may produce an additive CNS depression, when taken with this combination product, and should be avoided.
 

 Hydrocodone may be habit forming. Patients should take the drug only for as long as it is prescribed, in the amounts prescribed, and no more frequently than prescribed.



    Laboratory Tests



  In patients with severe hepatic or renal disease, effects of therapy should be monitored with serial liver and/or renal function tests.



    Drug Interactions



  Patients receiving narcotics, antihistamines, antipsychotics, antianxiety agents, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) concomitantly with VICODIN HP Tablets may exhibit an additive CNS depression. When combined therapy is contemplated, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced.



 The use of MAO inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants with hydrocodone preparations may increase the effect of either the antidepressant or hydrocodone.



    Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions



  Acetaminophen may produce false-positive test results for urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid.



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility



  No adequate studies have been conducted in animals to determine whether hydrocodone or acetaminophen have a potential for carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, or impairment of fertility.



    Pregnancy



   Teratogenic Effects



   Pregnancy Category C



  There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. VICODIN HP Tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.



    Nonteratogenic Effects



  Babies born to mothers who have been taking opioids regularly prior to delivery will be physically dependent. The withdrawal signs include irritability and excessive crying, tremors, hyperactive reflexes, increased respiratory rate, increased stools, sneezing, yawning, vomiting, and fever. The intensity of the syndrome does not always correlate with the duration of maternal opioid use or dose. There is no consensus on the best method of managing withdrawal.



    Labor and Delivery



  As with all narcotics, administration of VICODIN HP Tablets to the mother shortly before delivery may result in some degree of respiratory depression in the newborn, especially if higher doses are used.



    Nursing Mothers



  Acetaminophen is excreted in breast milk in small amounts, but the significance of its effects on nursing infants is not known. It is not known whether hydrocodone is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from hydrocodone and acetaminophen, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.



    Pediatric Use



  Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population have not been established.



    Geriatric Use



  Clinical studies of VICODIN HP (hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen 10 mg/660 mg) did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.



 Hydrocodone and the major metabolites of acetaminophen are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney. Thus the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function due to accumulation of the parent compound and/or metabolites in the plasma. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.



 Hydrocodone may cause confusion and over-sedation in the elderly; elderly patients generally should be started on low doses of hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen tablets and observed closely.

   Hepatotoxicity



  Acetaminophen has been associated with cases of acute liver failure, at times resulting in liver transplant and death. Most of the cases of liver injury are associated with the use of acetaminophen at doses that exceed 4000 milligrams per day, and often involve more than one acetaminophen-containing product. The excessive intake of acetaminophen may be intentional to cause self-harm or unintentional as patients attempt to obtain more pain relief or unknowingly take other acetaminophen-containing products.



 The risk of acute liver failure is higher in individuals with underlying liver disease and in individuals who ingest alcohol while taking acetaminophen.



 Instruct patients to look for acetaminophen or APAP on package labels and not to use more than one product that contains acetaminophen. Instruct patients to seek medical attention immediately upon ingestion of more than 4000 milligrams of acetaminophen per day, even if they feel well.



    Hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis



  There have been post-marketing reports of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis associated with use of acetaminophen. Clinical signs included swelling of the face, mouth and throat, respiratory distress, urticaria, rash, pruritus, and vomiting. There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergency medical attention. Instruct patients to discontinue VICODIN HP Tablets immediately and seek medical care if they experience these symptoms. Do not prescribe VICODIN HP Tablets for patients with acetaminophen allergy.



    Respiratory Depression



  At high doses or in sensitive patients, hydrocodone may produce dose-related respiratory depression by acting directly on the brain stem respiratory center. Hydrocodone also affects the center that controls respiratory rhythm, and may produce irregular and periodic breathing.



    Head Injury and Increased Intracranial Pressure



  The respiratory depressant effects of narcotics and their capacity to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of head injury, other intracranial lesions or a preexisting increase in intracranial pressure. Furthermore, narcotics produce adverse reactions which may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injuries.



    Acute Abdominal Conditions



  The administration of narcotics may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions.



    Misuse Abuse and Diversion of Opioids



  VICODIN HP contains hydrocodone an opioid agonist, and is a Schedule III controlled substance. Opioid agonists have the potential for being abused and are sought by abusers and people with addiction disorders, and are subject to diversion.



 VICODIN HP can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing VICODIN HP in situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse or diversion (see  DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE  ).
