    6.1    Clinical Trials Experience  

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 Adverse reaction information for diclofenac sodium and misoprostol is derived from Phase III multinational controlled clinical trials in over 2,000 patients receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 50 mg/0.2 mg or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 75 mg/0.2 mg, as well as from blinded, controlled trials of diclofenac delayed-release tablets and misoprostol tablets.



   Gastrointestinal  



 GI disorders had the highest reported incidence of adverse events for patients receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol. These events were generally minor, but led to discontinuation of therapy in 9% of patients on diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and 5% of patients on diclofenac. For GI ulcer rates,  [see      Clinical Studies (14)      ]  .




    GI disorder       Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol       Diclofenac     
  Abdominal pain   21%              15%              
  Diarrhea         19%              11%              
  Dyspepsia        14%              11%              
  Nausea           11%              6%               
  Flatulence       9%               4%               
         Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol can cause more abdominal pain, diarrhea, and other GI symptoms than diclofenac alone.
 

 Diarrhea and abdominal pain developed early in the course of therapy, and were usually self-limited (resolved after 2 to 7 days). Rare instances of profound diarrhea leading to severe dehydration have been reported in patients receiving misoprostol. Patients with an underlying condition such as inflammatory bowel disease, or those in whom dehydration, were it to occur, would be dangerous, should be monitored carefully if diclofenac sodium and misoprostol is prescribed. The incidence of diarrhea can be minimized by administering diclofenac sodium and misoprostol with food and by avoiding coadministration with magnesium-containing antacids.



   Gynecological  



 Gynecological disorders previously reported with misoprostol use have also been reported for women receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol (see below). Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding may be related to administration of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol. If it occurs, diagnostic workup should be undertaken to rule out gynecological pathology  [see      Boxed Warnings      ,      Contraindications (4)      and      Warnings and Precautions (5)      ]  .

    5.1   Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events  



   Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.  



  To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.  



  There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as diclofenac, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [see     Warnings and Precautions (5.2)     ]  .  



   Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery    



  Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG [see     Contraindications (4)     ]  .  



   Post-MI Patients    



  Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up.  



  Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.  



     5.2   Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation  



   NSAIDs, including diclofenac, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk.  



   Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation    



  Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.  



   Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients:    



   ● Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration.  ● Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time.● Avoid use in patients at high risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs.● Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy.● If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out.● In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [see     Drug Interactions (7)     ]  .  
 

     5.3   Hepatotoxicity  



   In clinical trials with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol, meaningful elevation of ALT (SGPT, more than 3 times the ULN [ULN = the upper limit of the normal range]) occurred in 1.6% of 2,184 patients treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and in 1.4% of 1,691 patients treated with diclofenac sodium. These increases were generally transient, and enzyme levels returned to within the normal range upon discontinuation of therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. The misoprostol component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets does not appear to exacerbate the hepatic effects caused by the diclofenac sodium component.  



  In clinical trials of diclofenac-containing products, meaningful elevations (i.e., more than 3 times the ULN) of AST (SGOT) occurred in about 2% of approximately 5,700 patients at some time during diclofenac treatment (ALT was not measured in all studies).  



  In a large, open-label, controlled trial of 3,700 patients treated with oral diclofenac sodium for 2 to 6 months, patients were monitored first at 8 weeks and 1,200 patients were monitored again at 24 weeks. Meaningful elevations of ALT and/or AST occurred in about 4% of patients and included marked elevations (i.e., greater than 8 times the ULN) in about 1% of the 3,700 patients. In that open-label study, a higher incidence of borderline (less than 3 times the ULN), moderate (3 to 8 times the ULN), and marked (greater than 8 times the ULN) elevations of ALT or AST was observed in patients receiving diclofenac when compared to other NSAIDs. Elevations in transaminases were seen more frequently in patients with osteoarthritis than in those with rheumatoid arthritis.  



  Almost all meaningful elevations in transaminases were detected before patients became symptomatic. Abnormal tests occurred during the first 2 months of therapy with diclofenac in 42 of the 51 patients in all trials who developed marked transaminase elevations.  



  In postmarketing reports, cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported in the first month, and in some cases, the first 2 months of therapy, but can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. Postmarketing surveillance has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, and liver failure. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation.  



  In a European retrospective population-based, case-controlled study, 10 cases of diclofenac associated drug-induced liver injury with current use compared with non-use of diclofenac were associated with a statistically significant 4-fold adjusted odds ratio of liver injury. In this particular study, based on an overall number of 10 cases of liver injury associated with diclofenac, the adjusted odds ratio increased further with female gender, doses of 150 mg or more, and duration of use for more than 90 days.  



  Physicians should measure transaminases at baseline and periodically in patients receiving long-term therapy with diclofenac, because severe hepatotoxicity may develop without a prodrome of distinguishing symptoms. The optimum times for making the first and subsequent transaminase measurements are not known. Based on clinical trial data and postmarketing experiences, transaminases should be monitored within 4 to 8 weeks after initiating treatment with diclofenac. However, severe hepatic reactions can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac.  



  If abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, if clinical signs and/or symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dark urine, etc.), diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets should be discontinued immediately.  



  Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flu-like" symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient.  



  To minimize the potential risk for an adverse liver related event in patients treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Exercise caution when prescribing diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with concomitant drugs that are known to be potentially hepatotoxic (e.g., antibiotics, anti-epileptics).  



     5.4   Hypertension  



   NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium and misoprostol, can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs [see     Drug Interactions (7)     ]  .  



  Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.  



     5.5   Heart Failure and Edema  



   The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death.  



  Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of diclofenac may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) [see     Drug Interactions (7)     ]  .  



  Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure.  



     5.6   Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia  



    Renal Toxicity    



  Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.  



  No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with pre-existing renal disease.  



  Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac sodium and misoprostol. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol [see     Drug Interactions (7)     ]  . Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.  



   Hyperkalemia    



  Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.  



     5.7   Anaphylactic Reactions  



   Diclofenac/misoprostol has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to diclofenac/misoprostol and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [see     Contraindications (4)     and     Warnings and Precautions (5.8)     ]  .  



  Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs.  



     5.8   Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity  



   A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol is contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity [see     Contraindications (4)     ]  . When diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma.  



     5.9   Serious Skin Reactions  



   NSAIDs, including diclofenac, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol is contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [see     Contraindications (4)     ]  .  



     5.10       Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus  



   Diclofenac may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol is contraindicated in pregnant women. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets [see     Contraindications (4)     and Use in Specific Populations (   8.1   ,     8.3     )]  .  



     5.11       Hematologic Toxicity  



   Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit.  



  NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium and misoprostol, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders or concomitant use of warfarin and other anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), and serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding [see     Drug Interactions (7)     ]  .  



     5.12   Masking of Inflammation and Fever  



   The pharmacological activity of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.  



     5.13   Laboratory Monitoring  



   Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a CBC and a chemistry profile periodically [see Warnings and Precautions (     5.2     ,     5.6     )]  .
