  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     Single Agent  



 The data described below reflect exposure to GEMZAR as a single agent administered at doses between 800 mg/m  2  to 1250 mg/m  2  intravenously over 30 minutes once weekly in 979 patients with various malignancies. The most common (&gt;=20%) adverse reactions of single agent GEMZAR are nausea/vomiting, anemia, increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), neutropenia, increased alkaline phosphatase, proteinuria, fever, hematuria, rash, thrombocytopenia, dyspnea, and edema. The most common (&gt;=5%) Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were neutropenia, nausea/vomiting, increased ALT, increased alkaline phosphatase, anemia, increased AST, and thrombocytopenia. Approximately 10% of the 979 patients discontinued GEMZAR due to adverse reactions. Adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of GEMZAR in 2% of 979 patients were cardiovascular adverse events (myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, arrhythmia, and hypertension) and adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of GEMZAR in &lt;1% of 979 patients were anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatic dysfunction, renal dysfunction, nausea/vomiting, fever, rash, dyspnea, hemorrhage, infection, stomatitis, somnolence, flu-like syndrome, and edema.



   Tables 5  and  6  present the incidence of selected adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities reported in patients with various malignancies receiving single agent GEMZAR across 5 clinical trials. Additional clinically significant adverse reactions are provided following  Table 6  .

   Tables 7  and  8  presents the incidence of selected adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities occurring in &gt;=10% of GEMZAR-treated patients and at a higher incidence in the GEMZAR with cisplatin arm, reported in a randomized trial (Study 3) of GEMZAR with cisplatin (n=260) administered in 28-day cycles as compared to cisplatin alone (n=262) in patients receiving first-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)  [see Clinical Studies (  14.3  )]  .



 Patients randomized to GEMZAR with cisplatin received a median of 4 cycles of treatment and those randomized to cisplatin alone received a median of 2 cycles of treatment. In this trial, the requirement for dose adjustments (&gt;90% versus 16%), discontinuation of treatment for adverse reactions (15% versus 8%), and the proportion of patients hospitalized (36% versus 23%) were all higher for patients receiving GEMZAR with cisplatin compared to those receiving cisplatin alone. The incidence of febrile neutropenia (3% versus&lt;1%), sepsis (4% versus 1%), Grade 3 cardiac dysrhythmias (3% versus &lt;1%) were all higher in the GEMZAR with cisplatin arm compared to the cisplatin alone arm. The two-drug combination was more myelosuppressive with 4 (1.5%) possibly treatment-related deaths, including 3 resulting from myelosuppression with infection and one case of renal failure associated with pancytopenia and infection. No deaths due to treatment were reported on the cisplatin arm.

               Tables 9  and  10  present the incidence of selected adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities occurring in &gt;=10% of GEMZAR-treated patients and at a higher incidence in the GEMZAR with cisplatin arm, reported in a randomized trial (Study 4) of GEMZAR with cisplatin (n=69) administered in 21-day cycles as compared to etoposide with cisplatin (n=66) in patients receiving first-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)  [see Clinical Studies (  14.3  )]  . Additional clinically significant adverse reactions are provided following  Table 10  .
 

 Patients in the GEMZAR/cisplatin (GC) arm received a median of 5 cycles and those in the etoposide/cisplatin (EC) arm received a median of 4 cycles. The majority of patients receiving more than one cycle of treatment required dose adjustments; 81% in the GC arm and 68% in the EC arm. The incidence of hospitalizations for adverse reactions was 22% in the GC arm and 27% in the EC arm. The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment for adverse reactions was higher in the GC arm (14% versus 8%). The proportion of patients who were hospitalized for febrile neutropenia was lower in the GC arm (7% versus 12%). There was one death attributed to treatment, a patient with febrile neutropenia and renal failure, which occurred in the GC arm.

   Tables 13  and  14  present the incidence of selected adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, occurring in &gt;=10% of GEMZAR-treated patients and at a higher incidence in the GEMZAR with carboplatin arm, reported in a randomized trial (Study 1) of GEMZAR with carboplatin (n=175) compared to carboplatin alone (n=174) for the second-line treatment of ovarian cancer in women with disease that had relapsed more than 6 months following first-line platinum-based chemotherapy  [see Clinical Studies (  14.1  )]  . Additional clinically significant adverse reactions, occurring in &lt;10% of patients, are provided following  Table 14  .



 The proportion of patients with dose adjustments for carboplatin (1.8% versus 3.8%), doses of carboplatin omitted (0.2% versus 0) and discontinuing treatment for adverse reactions (11% versus 10%), were similar between arms. Dose adjustment for GEMZAR occurred in 10% of patients and GEMZAR dose was omitted in 14% of patients in the GEMZAR/carboplatin arm.

             Hematopoietic growth factors were administered more frequently in the GEMZAR-containing arm: leukocyte growth factor (24% and 10%) and erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (7% and 3.9%).
 

 The following clinically relevant Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions occurred more frequently in the GEMZAR with carboplatin arm: dyspnea (3.4% versus 2.9%), febrile neutropenia (1.1% versus 0), hemorrhagic event (2.3% versus 1.1 %), motor neuropathy (1.1% versus 0.6%), and rash/desquamation (0.6% versus 0).



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of GEMZAR. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 *   Infections and infestation : Infections, sepsis 
 *   Blood and lymphatic system disorders : Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) 
 *   Cardiovascular : Congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, supraventricular arrhythmias 
 *   Vascular : Peripheral vasculitis, gangrene, capillary leak syndrome 
 *   Skin : Cellulitis, pseudocellulitis, severe skin reactions, including desquamation and bullous skin eruptions 
 *   Hepatic : Hepatic failure, hepatic veno-occlusive disease 
 *   Pulmonary : Interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary edema, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 
 *   Nervous System : Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)

   5.1 Schedule-Dependent Toxicity



  In clinical trials evaluating the maximum tolerated dose of GEMZAR, prolongation of the infusion time beyond 60 minutes or more frequent than weekly dosing resulted in an increased incidence of clinically significant hypotension, severe flu-like symptoms, myelosuppression, and asthenia. The half-life of GEMZAR is influenced by the length of the infusion [see Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )]  . Refer to the recommended GEMZAR dosage [see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  ,  2.2  ,  2.3  ,  2.4  )]  .



    5.2 Myelosuppression



  Myelosuppression manifested by neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia occurs with GEMZAR as a single agent and the risks are increased when GEMZAR is combined with other cytotoxic drugs. In clinical trials, Grade 3-4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia occurred in 25%, 8%, and 5%, respectively of the 979 patients who received single agent GEMZAR. The frequencies of Grade 3-4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia varied from 48% to 71%, 8% to 28%, and 5% to 55%, respectively, in patients receiving GEMZAR in combination with another drug [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  .



 Prior to each dose of GEMZAR, obtain a complete blood count (CBC) with a differential and a platelet count. Modify the dosage as recommended [see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  ,  2.2  ,  2.3  ,  2.4  )]  .



    5.3 Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure



  Pulmonary toxicity, including interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary edema, and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), has been reported. In some cases, these pulmonary events can lead to fatal respiratory failure despite the discontinuation of therapy. The onset of pulmonary symptoms may occur up to 2 weeks after the last dose of GEMZAR [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  ,  6.2  )]  .



 Permanently discontinue GEMZAR in patients who develop unexplained dyspnea, with or without bronchospasm, or evidence of severe pulmonary toxicity.



    5.4 Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome



  Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), including fatalities from renal failure or the requirement for dialysis, can occur with GEMZAR. In clinical trials, HUS occurred in 0.25% of 2429 patients. Most fatal cases of renal failure were due to HUS [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  .



 Assess renal function prior to initiation of GEMZAR and periodically during treatment. Consider the diagnosis of HUS in patients who develop anemia with evidence of microangiopathic hemolysis; increased bilirubin or LDH; reticulocytosis; severe thrombocytopenia; or renal failure (increased serum creatinine or BUN). Permanently discontinue GEMZAR in patients with HUS or severe renal impairment. Renal failure may not be reversible even with the discontinuation of therapy.



    5.5 Hepatic Toxicity



  Drug-induced liver injury, including liver failure and death, has been reported in patients receiving GEMZAR alone or with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  ,  6.2  )]  . Administration of GEMZAR in patients with concurrent liver metastases or a pre-existing medical history or hepatitis, alcoholism, or liver cirrhosis can lead to exacerbation of the underlying hepatic insufficiency. Assess hepatic function prior to initiation of GEMZAR and periodically during treatment. Permanently discontinue GEMZAR in patients who develop severe hepatic toxicity.



    5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



  Based on animal data and its mechanism of action, GEMZAR can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Gemcitabine was teratogenic, embryotoxic, and fetotoxic in mice and rabbits.



 Advise women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with GEMZAR and for 6 months after the final dose. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with GEMZAR and for 3 months following the final dose [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  ,  8.3  )]  .



    5.7 Exacerbation of Radiation Therapy Toxicity



  GEMZAR is not recommended for use in combination with radiation therapy.



    Concurrent (given together or &lt;=7 days apart)  



 Life-threatening mucositis, especially esophagitis and pneumonitis occurred in a trial in which GEMZAR was administered at a dose of 1000 mg/m  2  to patients with non-small cell lung cancer for up to 6 consecutive weeks concurrently with thoracic radiation.



    Non-concurrent (given &gt;7 days apart)  



 Excessive toxicity has not been observed when GEMZAR is administered more than 7 days before or after radiation. Radiation recall has been reported in patients who receive GEMZAR after prior radiation.



    5.8 Capillary Leak Syndrome



  Capillary leak syndrome (CLS) with severe consequences has been reported in patients receiving GEMZAR as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents [see Adverse Reactions (  6.2  )]  . Permanently discontinue GEMZAR if CLS develops during therapy.



    5.9 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome



  Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has been reported in patients receiving GEMZAR as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents [see Adverse Reactions (  6.2  )]  . PRES can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, hypertension, confusion, blindness, and other visual and neurologic disturbances. Confirm the diagnosis of PRES with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Permanently discontinue GEMZAR if PRES develops during therapy.
