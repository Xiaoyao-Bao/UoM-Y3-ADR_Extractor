   5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse



   KADIAN contains morphine, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, KADIAN exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see  Drug Abuse and Dependence (9  )]  . As modified-release products such as KADIAN deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of morphine present.  



  Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed KADIAN and in those who obtain the drug illicitly. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused.  



  Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing KADIAN and monitor all patients receiving KADIAN for the development of these behaviors or conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol addiction or abuse) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the prescribing of KADIAN for the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed modified-release opioid formulations such as KADIAN, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of KADIAN along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse.  



  Abuse or misuse of KADIAN by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product will result in the uncontrolled delivery of the morphine and can result in overdose and death [see   Overdosage (10)  ]  .  



  Opioid agonists such as KADIAN are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing KADIAN. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see  Patient Counseling Information (17  )]  . Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.  



    5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression



   Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of modified-release opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression from opioid use, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see  Overdosage (10)  ]  . Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.  



 While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of KADIAN, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dose increase. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with KADIAN and following dose increases. 



 To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of KADIAN are essential [ see     Dosage and Administration (2       )    ].  Overestimating the KADIAN dose when converting patients from another opioid product can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. 



  Accidental injestion of even one dose of KADIAN, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of morphine.  



    5.3 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome



   Prolonged use of KADIAN during pregnancy can result in withdrawal signs in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available.  



  Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn.  



    5.4 Interactions with Central Nervous System Depressants



   Patients must not consume alcoholic beverages or prescription or non-prescription products containing alcohol while on KADIAN therapy. The co-ingestion of alcohol with KADIAN may result in increased plasma levels and a potentially fatal overdose of morphine [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3  )].    



  Hypotension, profound sedation, coma, respiratory depression, and death may result if KADIAN is used concomitantly with alcohol or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (e.g., sedatives, anxiolytics, hypnotics, neuroleptics, other opioids).  



  When considering the use of KADIAN in a patient taking a CNS depressant, assess the duration use of the CNS depressant and the patient's response, including the degree of tolerance that has developed to CNS depression. Additionally, evaluate the patient's use of alcohol or illicit drugs that cause CNS depression. If the decision to begin KADIAN is made, start with a low dose of KADIAN (30 mg or lower) every 24 hours, monitor patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, and consider using a lower dose of the concomitant CNS depressant [see  Drug Interactions (7  )]  .  



    5.5 Use in Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients



   Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients. Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating KADIAN and when KADIAN is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [ see     Warnings and Precautions (5.2      )  ].  



    5.6 Use in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease



  Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy and titrating with KADIAN, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of KADIAN may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea [ see      Warnings and Precautions (5.2    )  ].  Consider the use of alternative non-opioid analgesics in these patients if possible.



    5.7 Hypotensive Effect



  KADIAN may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [ see       Drug Interactions (7.2    )  ].  Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of KADIAN. In patients with circulatory shock, KADIAN may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of KADIAN in patients with circulatory shock.



    5.8 Use in Patients with Head Injury or Increased Intracranial Pressure



  Monitor patients taking KADIAN who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors) for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with KADIAN.  KADIAN may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2retention can further increase intracranial pressure .  Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury.



 Avoid the use of KADIAN in patients with impaired consciousness or coma.



    5.9 Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions



  KADIAN is contraindicated in patients with paralytic ileus.  Avoid the use of KADIAN in patients with other GI obstruction.



 The morphine in KADIAN may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi.  Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms.  Opioids may cause increases in the serum amylase.



    5.10 Use in Patients with Convulsive or Seizure Disorders



  The morphine in KADIAN may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings.  Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during KADIAN therapy.



    5.11 Avoidance of Withdrawal



   Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with a full opioid agonist analgesic, including KADIAN.  In these patients, mixed agonists/antagonists and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms.  



 When discontinuing KADIAN, gradually taper the dose [ see      Dosage and Administration (2.3    )  ].  Do not abruptly discontinue KADIAN.



    5.12 Driving and Operating Machinery



  KADIAN may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery.  Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of KADIAN and know how they will react to the medication.
