  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The safety of concomitantly administered empagliflozin (daily dose 10 mg and 25 mg) and metformin hydrochloride (mean daily dose of approximately 1800 mg) has been evaluated in 3456 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated for 16 to 24 weeks, of which 926 patients received placebo, 1271 patients received a daily dose of empagliflozin 10 mg, and 1259 patients received a daily dose of empagliflozin 25 mg. Discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events across treatment groups was 3.0%, 2.8%, and 2.9% for placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively.



   Empagliflozin Add-On Combination Therapy with Metformin  In a 24-week placebo-controlled trial of empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg administered once daily added to metformin, there were no adverse reactions reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in &gt;=5% of patients and more commonly than in patients given placebo.



   Empagliflozin Add-On Combination Therapy with Metformin and Sulfonylurea  In a 24-week placebo-controlled trial of empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg administered once daily added to metformin and sulfonylurea, adverse reactions reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in &gt;=5% of patients and more commonly than in patients given placebo are presented in Table 1 (see also Table 4).

        Empagliflozin  The data in Table 2 are derived from a pool of four 24-week placebo-controlled trials and 18-week data from a placebo-controlled trial with basal insulin. Empagliflozin was used as monotherapy in one trial and as add-on therapy in four trials  [see Clinical Studies (  14  )]  .
 

 These data reflect exposure of 1976 patients to empagliflozin with a mean exposure duration of approximately 23 weeks. Patients received placebo (N=995), empagliflozin 10 mg (N=999), or empagliflozin 25 mg (N=977) once daily. The mean age of the population was 56 years and 3% were older than 75 years of age. More than half (55%) of the population was male; 46% were White, 50% were Asian, and 3% were Black or African American. At baseline, 57% of the population had diabetes more than 5 years and had a mean hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 8%. Established microvascular complications of diabetes at baseline included diabetic nephropathy (7%), retinopathy (8%), or neuropathy (16%). Baseline renal function was normal or mildly impaired in 91% of patients and moderately impaired in 9% of patients (mean eGFR 86.8 mL/min/1.73 m  2  ).



 Table 2 shows common adverse reactions (excluding hypoglycemia) associated with the use of empagliflozin. The adverse reactions were not present at baseline, occurred more commonly on empagliflozin than on placebo and occurred in greater than or equal to 2% of patients treated with empagliflozin 10 mg or empagliflozin 25 mg.

      Thirst (including polydipsia) was reported in 0%, 1.7%, and 1.5% for placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively.
 

   Volume Depletion  Empagliflozin causes an osmotic diuresis, which may lead to intravascular volume contraction and adverse reactions related to volume depletion. In the pool of five placebo-controlled clinical trials, adverse reactions related to volume depletion (e.g., blood pressure (ambulatory) decreased, blood pressure systolic decreased, dehydration, hypotension, hypovolemia, orthostatic hypotension, and syncope) were reported by 0.3%, 0.5%, and 0.3% of patients treated with placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively. Empagliflozin may increase the risk of hypotension in patients at risk for volume contraction  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  ) and Use in Specific Populations (  8.5  ,  8.6  )].  



   Increased Urination  In the pool of five placebo-controlled clinical trials, adverse reactions of increased urination (e.g., polyuria, pollakiuria, and nocturia) occurred more frequently on empagliflozin than on placebo (see Table 3). Specifically, nocturia was reported by 0.4%, 0.3%, and 0.8% of patients treated with placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively.



   Acute Impairment in Renal Function  Treatment with empagliflozin was associated with increases in serum creatinine and decreases in eGFR (see Table 3). Patients with moderate renal impairment at baseline had larger mean changes  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.4  ) and Use in Specific Populations (  8.5  ,  8.6  )]  .



 In a long-term cardiovascular outcome trial, the acute impairment in renal function was observed to reverse after treatment discontinuation suggesting acute hemodynamic changes play a role in the renal function changes observed with empagliflozin.

        Genital Mycotic Infections  In the pool of five placebo-controlled clinical trials, the incidence of genital mycotic infections (e.g., vaginal mycotic infection, vaginal infection, genital infection fungal, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and vulvitis) was increased in patients treated with empagliflozin compared to placebo, occurring in 0.9%, 4.1%, and 3.7% of patients randomized to placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively. Discontinuation from study due to genital infection occurred in 0% of placebo-treated patients and 0.2% of patients treated with either empagliflozin 10 or 25 mg.
 

 Genital mycotic infections occurred more frequently in female than male patients (see Table 2).



 Phimosis occurred more frequently in male patients treated with empagliflozin 10 mg (less than 0.1%) and empagliflozin 25 mg (0.1%) than placebo (0%).



   Urinary Tract Infections  In the pool of five placebo-controlled clinical trials, the incidence of urinary tract infections (e.g., urinary tract infection, asymptomatic bacteriuria, and cystitis) was increased in patients treated with empagliflozin compared to placebo (see Table 2). Patients with a history of chronic or recurrent urinary tract infections were more likely to experience a urinary tract infection. The rate of treatment discontinuation due to urinary tract infections was 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.1% for placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively.



 Urinary tract infections occurred more frequently in female patients. The incidence of urinary tract infections in female patients randomized to placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg was 16.6%, 18.4%, and 17.0%, respectively. The incidence of urinary tract infections in male patients randomized to placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg was 3.2%, 3.6%, and 4.1%, respectively  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.5  ) and Use in Specific Populations (  8.5  )]  .



   Metformin  The most common (&gt;5%) established adverse reactions due to initiation of metformin therapy are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, abdominal discomfort, indigestion, asthenia, and headache.



 In a 24-week clinical trial in which extended-release metformin or placebo was added to glyburide therapy, the most common (&gt;5% and greater than placebo) adverse reactions in the combined treatment group were hypoglycemia (13.7% vs 4.9%), diarrhea (12.5% vs 5.6%), and nausea (6.7% vs 4.2%).



 Long-term treatment with metformin has been associated with a decrease in vitamin B12absorption which may very rarely result in clinically significant vitamin B12deficiency (e.g., megaloblastic anemia)  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.10  )].  



   Laboratory Tests    Empagliflozin    Increase in Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C):  Dose-related increases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were observed in patients treated with empagliflozin. LDL-C increased by 2.3%, 4.6%, and 6.5% in patients treated with placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.11  )]  . The range of mean baseline LDL-C levels was 90.3 to 90.6 mg/dL across treatment groups.



   Increase in Hematocrit:  In a pool of four placebo-controlled studies, median hematocrit decreased by 1.3% in placebo and increased by 2.8% in empagliflozin 10 mg and 2.8% in empagliflozin 25 mg treated patients. At the end of treatment, 0.6%, 2.7%, and 3.5% of patients with hematocrits initially within the reference range had values above the upper limit of the reference range with placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively.



   Metformin  In controlled clinical trials of metformin of 29 weeks' duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum Vitamin B12levels, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, is, however, very rarely associated with anemia and appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or Vitamin B12supplementation  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.10  )]  .



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  Additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: LACTIC ACIDOSIS

  WARNING: LACTIC ACIDOSIS

    Postmarketing cases of metformin-associated

lactic acidosis have resulted in death, hypothermia, hypotension,

and resistant bradyarrhythmias. The onset of metformin-associated

lactic acidosis is often subtle, accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms

such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal

pain. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated

blood lactate levels (&gt;5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without

evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), an increased lactate/pyruvate

ratio; and metformin plasma levels generally &gt;5 mcg/mL   [see

Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )]  .  



   Risk

factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis include renal impairment,

concomitant use of certain drugs (e.g., carbonic anhydrase inhibitors

such as topiramate), age 65 years old or greater, having a radiological

study with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states

(e.g., acute congestive heart failure), excessive alcohol intake,

and hepatic impairment.  



   Steps to reduce the risk of and manage

metformin-associated lactic acidosis in these high risk groups are

provided in the full prescribing information   [see Dosage and

Administration (  2.2  ), Contraindications

(  4  ), Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  ), Drug Interactions (  7.2  ), and Use in Specific Populations (  8.6  ,   8.7  )].

   5.1 Lactic Acidosis



  There have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (&gt;5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate:pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels generally &gt;5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.



 If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of SYNJARDY XR. In SYNJARDY XR-treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin is dialyzable, with a clearance of up to 170 mL/minute under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.



 Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and if these symptoms occur instruct them to discontinue SYNJARDY XR and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.



 For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:



    Renal Impairment:  The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  ), Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )]  .    
 

 *  Before initiating SYNJARDY XR, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). 
 *  SYNJARDY XR is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR below 45 mL/min/1.73 m  2   [see Contraindications (  4  )].  
 *  Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking SYNJARDY XR. In patients at increased risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. 
     Drug Interactions:  The concomitant use of SYNJARDY XR with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance or increase metformin accumulation [see Drug Interactions (  7.2  )]  . Therefore, consider more frequent monitoring of patients.
 

  Age 65 or Greater:  The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.5  )]  .



  Radiological Studies with Contrast:  Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop SYNJARDY XR at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 45 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m  2  ; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart SYNJARDY XR if renal function is stable.



  Surgery and Other Procedures:  Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension and renal impairment. SYNJARDY XR should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.



  Hypoxic States:  Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia. When such events occur, discontinue SYNJARDY XR.



  Excessive Alcohol Intake:  Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism and this may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving SYNJARDY XR.



  Hepatic Impairment:  Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of SYNJARDY XR in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.



    5.2 Hypotension



  Empagliflozin causes intravascular volume contraction. Symptomatic hypotension may occur after initiating empagliflozin [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  particularly in patients with renal impairment, the elderly, in patients with low systolic blood pressure, and in patients on diuretics. Before initiating SYNJARDY XR, assess for volume contraction and correct volume status if indicated. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension after initiating therapy and increase monitoring in clinical situations where volume contraction is expected [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.5  )]  .



    5.3 Ketoacidosis



  Reports of ketoacidosis, a serious life-threatening condition requiring urgent hospitalization have been identified in postmarketing surveillance in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, including empagliflozin. Fatal cases of ketoacidosis have been reported in patients taking empagliflozin. SYNJARDY XR is not indicated for the treatment of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus [see Indications and Usage (  1  )]  .



 Patients treated with SYNJARDY XR who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis should be assessed for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels, as ketoacidosis associated with SYNJARDY XR may be present even if blood glucose levels are less than 250 mg/dL. If ketoacidosis is suspected, SYNJARDY XR should be discontinued, patient should be evaluated, and prompt treatment should be instituted. Treatment of ketoacidosis may require insulin, fluid and carbohydrate replacement.



 In many of the postmarketing reports, and particularly in patients with type 1 diabetes, the presence of ketoacidosis was not immediately recognized and institution of treatment was delayed because presenting blood glucose levels were below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (often less than 250 mg/dL). Signs and symptoms at presentation were consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis and included nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. In some but not all cases, factors predisposing to ketoacidosis such as insulin dose reduction, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake due to illness or surgery, pancreatic disorders suggesting insulin deficiency (e.g., type 1 diabetes, history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery), and alcohol abuse were identified.



 Before initiating SYNJARDY XR, consider factors in the patient history that may predispose to ketoacidosis including pancreatic insulin deficiency from any cause, caloric restriction, and alcohol abuse. In patients treated with SYNJARDY XR consider monitoring for ketoacidosis and temporarily discontinuing SYNJARDY XR in clinical situations known to predispose to ketoacidosis (e.g., prolonged fasting due to acute illness or surgery).



    5.4 Acute Kidney Injury and Impairment in Renal Function



  Empagliflozin causes intravascular volume contraction [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )]  and can cause renal impairment [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . There have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin; some reports involved patients younger than 65 years of age.



 Before initiating SYNJARDY XR, consider factors that may predispose patients to acute kidney injury including hypovolemia, chronic renal insufficiency, congestive heart failure and concomitant medications (diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, NSAIDs). Consider temporarily discontinuing SYNJARDY XR in any setting of reduced oral intake (such as acute illness or fasting) or fluid losses (such as gastrointestinal illness or excessive heat exposure); monitor patients for signs and symptoms of acute kidney injury. If acute kidney injury occurs, discontinue SYNJARDY XR promptly and institute treatment.



 Empagliflozin increases serum creatinine and decreases eGFR. Patients with hypovolemia may be more susceptible to these changes. Renal function abnormalities can occur after initiating SYNJARDY XR [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . Renal function should be evaluated prior to initiation of SYNJARDY XR and monitored periodically thereafter. More frequent renal function monitoring is recommended in patients with an eGFR below 60 mL/min/1.73 m  2  . Use of SYNJARDY XR is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m  2   [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  ), Contraindications (  4  ) and Use in Specific Populations (  8.6  )]  .



    5.5 Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis



  There have been postmarketing reports of serious urinary tract infections including urosepsis and pyelonephritis requiring hospitalization in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin. Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated [see Adverse Reactions (  6  )]  .



    5.6 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues



    Empagliflozin    Insulin and insulin secretagogues are known to cause hypoglycemia. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased when empagliflozin is used in combination with insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . Therefore, a lower dose of the insulin secretagogue or insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with SYNJARDY XR.
 

   Metformin    Hypoglycemia does not occur in patients receiving metformin alone under usual circumstances of use, but could occur when caloric intake is deficient, when strenuous exercise is not compensated by caloric supplementation, or during concomitant use with other glucose-lowering agents (such as SUs and insulin) or ethanol. Elderly, debilitated, or malnourished patients, and those with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency or alcohol intoxication are particularly susceptible to hypoglycemic effects. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly, and in people who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking drugs. Monitor for a need to lower the dose of SYNJARDY XR to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia in these patients.
 

    5.7 Necrotizing Fasciitis of the Perineum (Fournier's Gangrene)



   Reports of necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier's gangrene), a rare but serious and life-threatening necrotizing infection requiring urgent surgical intervention, have been identified in postmarketing surveillance in patients with diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin. Cases have been reported in both females and males. Serious outcomes have included hospitalization, multiple surgeries, and death.  



  Patients treated with SYNJARDY XR presenting with pain or tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, along with fever or malaise, should be assessed for necrotizing fasciitis. If suspected, start treatment immediately with broad-spectrum antibiotics and, if necessary, surgical debridement. Discontinue SYNJARDY XR, closely monitor blood glucose levels, and provide appropriate alternative therapy for glycemic control.  



    5.8 Genital Mycotic Infections



  Empagliflozin increases the risk for genital mycotic infections [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . Patients with a history of chronic or recurrent genital mycotic infections were more likely to develop genital mycotic infections. Monitor and treat as appropriate.



    5.9 Hypersensitivity Reactions



   There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions, (e.g., angioedema) in patients treated with empagliflozin, one of the components of SYNJARDY XR. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue SYNJARDY XR; treat promptly per standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. SYNJARDY XR is contraindicated in patients with a previous serious hypersensitivity reaction to empagliflozin or any of the excipients in SYNJARDY XR [see Contraindications (  4  )]  .  



    5.10 Vitamin B12Levels



  In controlled, 29-week clinical trials of metformin, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12levels, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of metformin-treated patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, is, however, very rarely associated with anemia or neurologic manifestations due to the short duration (&lt;1 year) of the clinical trials. This risk may be more relevant to patients receiving long-term treatment with metformin, and adverse hematologic and neurologic reactions have been reported postmarketing. The decrease in vitamin B12levels appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B12supplementation. Measurement of hematologic parameters on an annual basis is advised in patients on SYNJARDY XR and any apparent abnormalities should be appropriately investigated and managed. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12levels. In these patients, routine serum vitamin B12measurement at 2- to 3-year intervals may be useful.



    5.11 Increased Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C)



  Increases in LDL-C can occur with empagliflozin. Monitor and treat as appropriate.



    5.12 Macrovascular Outcomes



  There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with SYNJARDY XR.
