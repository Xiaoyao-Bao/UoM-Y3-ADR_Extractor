  Adverse events that are clearly related to Betapace AF are those which are typical of its Class II (beta-blocking) and Class III (cardiac action potential duration prolongation) effects. The common documented beta-blocking adverse events (bradycardia, dyspnea, and fatigue) and Class III effects (QT interval prolongation) are dose related.



 In a pooled clinical trial population consisting of four placebo-controlled studies with 275 patients with AFIB/AFL treated with 160-320 mg doses of Betapace AF, the following adverse events were reported at a rate of 2% or more in the 160-240 mg treated patients and greater than the rate in placebo patients (See Table 8). The data are presented by incidence of events in the Betapace AF and placebo groups by body system and daily dose. No significant irreversible non-cardiac end-organ toxicity was observed.

          Overall, discontinuation because of unacceptable adverse events was necessary in 17% of the patients, and occurred in 10% of patients less than two weeks after starting treatment. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation of Betapace AF were: fatigue 4.6%, bradycardia 2.4%, proarrhythmia 2.2%, dyspnea 2%, and QT interval prolongation 1.4%.
 

 In clinical trials involving 1292 patients with sustained VT/VF, the common adverse events (occurring in &gt;=2% of patients) were similar to those described for the AFIB/AFL population.



 Occasional reports of elevated serum liver enzymes have occurred with sotalol therapy but no cause and effect relationship has been established. One case of peripheral neuropathy which resolved on discontinuation of sotalol and recurred when the patient was rechallenged with the drug was reported in an early dose tolerance study. Elevated blood glucose levels and increased insulin requirements can occur in diabetic patients.



 In an unblinded multicenter trial of 25 patients with SVT and/or VT receiving daily doses of 30, 90 and 210 mg/m  2  with dosing every 8 hours for a total of 9 doses, no Torsades de Pointes or other serious new arrhythmias were observed. One (1) patient, receiving 30 mg/m  2  daily, was discontinued because of increased frequency of sinus pauses/bradycardia. Additional cardiovascular AEs were seen at the 90 and 210 mg/m  2  daily dose levels. They included QT prolongations (2 patients), sinus pauses/bradycardia (1 patient), increased severity of atrial flutter and reported chest pain (1 patient). Values for QTc&gt;=525 msec were seen in 2 patients at the 210 mg/m  2  daily dose level. Serious adverse events including death, Torsades de Pointes, other proarrhythmias, high-degree A-V blocks and bradycardia have been reported in infants and/or children.



   Potential Adverse Effects

  Foreign marketing experience with sotalol hydrochloride shows an adverse experience profile similar to that described above from clinical trials. Voluntary reports since introduction also include rare reports of: emotional liability, slightly clouded sensorium, incoordination, vertigo, paralysis, thrombocytopenia, eosinophilia, leukopenia, photosensitivity reaction, fever, pulmonary edema, hyperlipidemia, myalgia, pruritis, alopecia.



 The oculomucocutaneous syndrome associated with the beta-blocker practolol has not been associated with  Betapace AF  during investigational use and foreign marketing experience.

    BOXED WARNING: 

  

    To minimize the risk of induced arrhythmia, patients initiated or re-initiated on Betapace AF  (r)   should be placed for a minimum of three days (on their maintenance dose) in a facility that can provide cardiac resuscitation, continuous electrocardiographic monitoring and calculations of creatinine clearance. For detailed instructions regarding dose selection, and special cautions for people with renal impairment, see   DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  .   Sotalol is also indicated for the treatment of documented life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and is marketed under the brand name Betapace  (r)  . Betapace  however, should not be substituted for Betapace AF  because of significant differences in labeling (i.e. patient package insert, dosing administration and safety information).

    BOXED WARNING: 

    PATIENT INFORMATION  



   What You Should Know About Betapace AF  



 (Bay' tah pace)



 (generic name: sotalol hydrochloride)



   

  This summary contains important patient information that has been reviewed and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. This summary is not meant to take the place of your doctor's instructions. Read this patient information carefully before you start taking Betapace AF. Each time you get a refill, you will receive patient information. Be sure to read it because it may contain new information that you need to know.



     What is the most important information I should know about Betapace AF?  



 Because you have irregular heartbeats (atrial fibrillation) that are troublesome to you, Betapace AF has been prescribed to help your heart to beat in a more normal way. However, in some patients Betapace AF can cause a different type of abnormal heartbeat that can be dangerous, and in rare instances can even cause death. You may feel this different type of abnormal heartbeat as a fast beating of the heart with lightheadedness and fainting. The possibility of this different type of abnormal heartbeat is the reason you and your doctor have discussed whether your symptoms are troublesome enough for you to start taking Betapace AF.



 Clinical studies using Betapace AF have shown that the most important way to decrease your chance of getting this different type of dangerous abnormal heartbeat is for you to take the dose of Betapace AF that is right for you. If this abnormal heartbeat occurs, it usually happens during the first few days of treatment. This is why you should be started on Betapace AF in a hospital or another place where your heartbeat can be watched closely by health care professionals for the first few days. They can help you if problems occur. When Betapace AF is started this way, this different type of abnormal heartbeat is rare and the hospital staff is there to treat it.



 It is important that when you go home, you take the exact dose the doctor prescribed for you. At any time while you are taking Betapace AF, watch for signs that you may be getting this different type of abnormal heartbeat and call your doctor if they occur. Call your doctor right away if you:



 *  faint, 
 *  become dizzy, or 
 *  have fast heartbeats. 
    If you cannot reach your doctor, go to the nearest hospital emergency room. Take your Betapace AF tablets with you and show them to the doctor or nurse.
 

 Also, call your doctor right away if you have any of the following conditions: 



 *  severe diarrhea 
 *   unusual sweating 
 *  vomiting 
 *  less appetite than normal, or 
 *  more thirst than normal. 
    These are conditions that will make you more likely to get the different type of abnormal heartbeat. 
 

 If you take Betapace AF with certain other medicines, you will increase your chance of getting this different type of abnormal heartbeat. These medicines are listed below under "  Who should not take Betapace AF?  "



 Once your doctor finds the right dose for you, always take that exact amount of Betapace AF. Never take an extra dose and never skip a dose of Betapace AF.



   What is Betapace AF?  



 Betapace AF is a medicine that is given to patients with atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeats). Atrial fibrillation happens when certain parts of the heart (the chambers known as atria) beat too fast or irregularly. When this happens, your heart cannot pump blood through your body as well as it should. This may make you feel weak and tired, or get out of breath easily. You may get an uncomfortable feeling in your chest and "fluttering" or "palpitations." Atrial fibrillation can be changed back (converted) to normal heart rhythm by an electric shock or by using certain medicines. However, atrial fibrillation can return. Betapace AF may help your heart stay beating regularly for a longer period of time. 



 This information about Betapace AF was developed to ensure that you and your doctor get the right information about your type of irregular heartbeats. Consult your doctor before you accept any other sotalol product that does not provide this patient information.



   Who should not take Betapace AF?  



 Betapace AF is not for everyone with irregular heartbeats (atrial fibrillation). This is why you and your doctor need to discuss the benefits and risks of Betapace AF and whether your symptoms are troublesome enough for you to start taking Betapace AF. 



 Do not take Betapace AF if you: 



 *  have serious kidney problems or are on kidney dialysis; 
 *  have lung disease causing shortness of breath (such as asthma, chronic bronchitis or emphysema); 
 *  have symptoms of heart failure (such as shortness of breath when you exercise or are physically active and swelling of the ankles or legs); 
 *  have a very slow heart beat and do not have an implanted artificial pacemaker; 
    Taking certain other medicines with Betapace AF can increase the chance that you will get the dangerous abnormal heartbeat discussed in "  What is the most important information I should know about Betapace AF?  " These include medicines used to treat abnormal heart rhythms and some other heart problems as well as medicines used to treat depression and other mental problems, night-time heartburn, asthma and infections. Therefore, you should be sure to tell your health care provider about all prescription and non-prescription medicines you are taking, as well as vitamins, dietary supplements, and any natural or herbal remedies. In addition, tell your doctor about any problems you have with your heart or kidneys.
 

 If you are pregnant, you should know that there is no information about the safety of Betapace AF in pregnant women. Some reports indicate that Betapace AF is passed into the breast milk. Women who are taking Betapace AF should not breast feed a child.



   How should I take Betapace AF?  



 Your doctor will start you on Betapace AF in the hospital and will check your heart rhythm for the first 2 or more days of treatment. This will allow your doctor to find the right dose for you. Always take the exact amount your doctor prescribes. Never change your Betapace AF dose unless your doctor tells you to. Your doctor will do regular tests to check that the amount you're taking is still right for you. 



 Keep taking your Betapace AF until your doctor tells you to stop. Keep taking it even if you feel fine. However, never take an extra dose of Betapace AF even if you do not feel well. When it is time to stop taking Betapace AF, your doctor will give you instructions on how to gradually reduce your dose over a period of 1 to 2 weeks. 



 You may take Betapace AF with or without food. However, it is important to take Betapace AF at the same time every day. This gives your heart a steady supply of the medicine. It might be helpful to take Betapace AF at the same time as something you regularly do every day. 



 If you are taking an antacid containing aluminum or magnesium to treat heartburn or upset stomach wait at least 2 hours after your dose of Betapace AF before you take the antacid. 



 Never try to make up for a missed dose of Betapace AF. You could increase your chance of getting the different type of abnormal heartbeat. If you miss taking a dose of Betapace AF, just take your normal amount at the next scheduled time. 



 If you take more Betapace AF than you should have, call your doctor right away. If you cannot reach your doctor, go to the nearest hospital emergency room. Take your Betapace AF tablets with you to show to the doctor or nurse.



   What should I avoid while taking Betapace AF?  



 Certain other medicines taken with Betapace AF may increase the chance that you will get the dangerous abnormal heartbeat (see   "Who should not take Betapace AF?"  ). Do not take Betapace AF with these medicines. Before you start taking Betapace AF tell your doctor about all prescription and non-prescription medicines you are taking (see also   "Who should not take Betapace AF?"  ). Once you begin taking Betapace AF, do not start taking any new medicines until you check with your doctor. 



 Carry a list of all the medicines and supplements you take. If you have to go to the hospital or are treated by new or different health care providers, tell them you are taking Betapace AF and show them the list of other medicines you take. They need this information to make sure your medicines are safe to take at the same time. 



 Tell your doctor or dentist you are taking Betapace AF before you have an operation or dental surgery. Betapace AF can affect how well some anesthetics work.



   What are the possible side effects of Betapace AF?  



 Betapace AF's most serious side effect, a different type of dangerous abnormal heartbeat, is discussed in "  What is the most important information I should know about Betapace AF?  " Dangerous abnormal heartbeats happen rarely. But they can be serious and, in rare instances, can even cause death. 



  Betapace AF's most common side effects are tiredness, slow rate, shortness of breath, and dizziness. Betapace AF can also cause other side effects. If you are concerned about these or any other side effects, ask your doctor.



   Important points about Betapace AF  



 Betapace AF can help you best if you take it as your doctor has prescribed it. 



 *  Take your medicine every day as prescribed. 
 *  Do not miss doses or take extra doses. 
 *  Call your doctor right away if you feel new fast heartbeats with lightheadedness and fainting. These can be serious and in rare instances can even cause death. 
 *  Do not take Betapace AF if you have serious kidney problems, lung disease causing shortness of breath, symptoms of heart failure. 
 *  Tell your doctor and pharmacist the name of all medications (prescription, non-prescription, and natural/herbal remedies) you are taking. 
 *  Do not start taking any other medicines without telling your doctor. 
 *  Go for all your regular checkups. 
 *  Get your refills on time. 
 *  Do not stop taking Betapace AF until your doctor tells you to stop. 
    This leaflet provides a summary of information about Betapace AF. Your doctor or pharmacist has a longer leaflet written for healthcare professionals that you can ask to read. Betapace AF was prescribed for your particular condition. Do not use it for another condition or give it to others.

    <Section id="S3" name="precautions">    PRECAUTIONS



   Renal Impairment



   Betapace AF (sotalol hydrochloride) is eliminated principally via the kidneys through glomerular filtration and to a small degree by tubular secretion. There is a direct relationship between renal function, as measured by serum creatinine or creatinine clearance, and the elimination rate of Betapace AF. Guidance for dosing in conditions of renal impairment can be found under "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION."  



    Information for Patients



  Please refer to the patient package insert.



  Prior to initiation of Betapace AF therapy, the patient should be advised to read the patient package insert and reread it each time therapy is renewed. The patient should be fully instructed on the need for compliance with the recommended dosing of Betapace AF, the potential interactions with drugs that prolong the QT interval and other antiarrhythmics, and the need for periodic monitoring of QT and renal function to minimize the risk of serious abnormal rhythms.  



     Medications and Supplements  



  Assessment of patients' medication history should include all over-counter, prescription and herbal/natural preparations with emphasis on preparations that may affect the pharmacodynamics of Betapace AF such as other cardiac antiarrhythmic drugs, some phenothiazines, bepridil, tricyclic antidepressants and oral macrolides (see   WARNINGS  and  Use with Drugs that Prolong QT Interval and Antiarrhythmic Agents    ). Patients should be instructed to notify their health care providers of any change in over-the-counter, prescription or supplement use. If a patient is hospitalized or is prescribed a new medication for any condition, the patient must inform the health care provider of ongoing Betapace AF therapy. Patients should also check with their health care provider and/or pharmacist prior to taking a new over-the-counter medicine.



     Electrolyte Imbalance  



  If patients experience symptoms that may be associated with altered electrolyte balance, such as excessive or prolonged diarrhea, sweating, or vomiting, or loss of appetite or thirst, these conditions should be immediately reported to their health care provider.



     Dosing Schedule  



  Patients should be instructed NOT to double the next dose if a dose is missed. The next dose should be taken at the usual time.



    Drug Interactions



   Drugs undergoing CYP450 metabolism



  Sotalol is primarily eliminated by renal excretion; therefore, drugs that are metabolized by CYP450 are not expected to alter the pharmacokinetics of sotalol.



    Digoxin



  Proarrhythmic events were more common in sotalol treated patients also receiving digoxin; it is not clear whether this represents an interaction or is related to the presence of CHF, a known risk factor for proarrhythmia, in the patients receiving digoxin. Both digitalis glycosides and beta-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia.



    Calcium blocking drugs



   Betapace AF should be administered with caution in conjunction with calcium blocking drugs because of possible additive effects on atrioventricular conduction or ventricular function. Additionally, concomitant use of these drugs may have additive effects on blood pressure, possibly leading to hypotension.



    Catecholamine-depleting agents



   Concomitant use of catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine and guanethidine, with a beta-blocker may produce an excessive reduction of resting sympathetic nervous tone. Patients treated with Betapace AF plus a catecholamine depletor should therefore be closely monitored for evidence of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia which may produce syncope.



    Insulin and oral antidiabetics



  Hyperglycemia may occur, and the dosage of insulin or antidiabetic drugs may require adjustment. Symptoms of hypoglycemia may be masked.



    Beta-2-receptor stimulants



  Beta-agonists such as salbutamol, terbutaline and isoprenaline may have to be administered in increased dosages when used concomitantly with Betapace AF.



    Clonidine



   Beta-blocking drugs may potentiate the rebound hypertension sometimes observed after discontinuation of clonidine; therefore, caution is advised when discontinuing clonidine in patients receiving Betapace AF.



    Other



  No pharmacokinetic interactions were observed with hydrochlorothiazide or warfarin.



    Antacids



  Administration of Betapace AF within 2 hours of antacids containing aluminum oxide and magnesium hydroxide should be avoided because it may result in a reduction in Cmax and AUC of 26% and 20%, respectively and consequently in a 25% reduction in the bradycardic effect at rest. Administration of the antacid two hours after Betapace AF has no effect on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of sotalol.



    Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions



  The presence of sotalol in the urine may result in falsely elevated levels of urinary metanephrine when measured by fluorimetric or photometric methods. In screening patients suspected of having a pheochromocytoma and being treated with sotalol, a specific method, such as a high performance liquid chromatographic assay with solid phase extraction (e.g., J. Chromatogr. 385:241, 1987) should be employed in determining levels of catecholamines.



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility



  No evidence of carcinogenic potential was observed in rats during a 24-month study at 137-275 mg/kg/ day (approximately 30 times the maximum recommended human oral dose (MRHD) as mg/kg or 5 times the MRHD as mg/m  2  ) or in mice, during a 24-month study at 4141-7122 mg/kg/day (approximately 450-750 times the MRHD as mg/kg or 36-63 times the MRHD as mg/m  2  ).



 Sotalol has not been evaluated in any specific assay of mutagenicity or clastogenicity.



 No significant reduction in fertility occurred in rats at oral doses of 1000 mg/kg/ day (approximately 100 times the MRHD as mg/kg or 9 times the MRHD as mg/m  2  ) prior to mating, except for a small reduction in the number of offspring per litter.



    Pregnancy Category B



  Reproduction studies in rats and rabbits during organogenesis at 100 and 22 times the MRHD as mg/kg (9 and 7 times the MRHD as mg/m  2  ), respectively, did not reveal any teratogenic potential associated with sotalol HCl. In rabbits, a high dose of sotalol HCl (160 mg/kg/day) at 16 times the MRHD as mg/kg (6 times the MRHD as mg/m  2  ) produced a slight increase in fetal death likely due to maternal toxicity. Eight times the maximum dose (80 mg/kg/day or 3 times the MRHD as mg/m  2  ) did not result in an increased incidence of fetal deaths. In rats, 1000 mg/kg/day sotalol HCl, 100 times the MRHD (18 times the MRHD as mg/m  2  ), increased the number of early resorptions, while at 14 times the maximum dose (2.5 times the MRHD as mg/m  2  ), no increase in early resorptions was noted. However, animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response.



 Although there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, sotalol HCl has been shown to cross the placenta, and is found in amniotic fluid. There has been a report of subnormal birth weight with sotalol. Therefore, Betapace AF should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk.



    Nursing Mothers



  Sotalol is excreted in the milk of laboratory animals and has been reported to be present in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants from Betapace AF, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.



    Pediatric Use



  The safety and effectiveness of Betapace AF in children have not been established. However, the Class III electrophysiologic and beta-blocking effects, the pharmacokinetics, and the relationship between the effects (QTcinterval and resting heart rate) and drug concentrations have been evaluated in children aged between 3 days and 12 years old. (See  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  .)

   Ventricular Arrhythmia



   Betapace AF (sotalol) can cause serious ventricular arrhythmias, primarily Torsade de Pointes (TdP) type ventricular tachycardia, a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia associated with QT interval prolongation. QT interval prolongation is directly related to the dose of Betapace AF. Factors such as reduced creatinine clearance, gender (female) and larger doses increase the risk of TdP. The risk of TdP can be reduced by adjustment of the Betapace AF dose according to creatinine clearance and by monitoring the ECG for excessive increases in the QT interval.  



  Treatment with Betapace AF must therefore be started only in patients observed for a minimum of three days on their maintenance dose in a facility that can provide electrocardiographic monitoring and in the presence of personnel trained in the management of serious ventricular arrhythmias. Calculation of the creatinine clearance must precede administration of the first dose of Betapace AF. For detailed instructions regarding dose selection, see  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  .  



    Proarrhythmia in Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter Patients:



  In eight controlled trials of patients with AFIB/AFL and other supraventricular arrhythmias (N=659) there were four cases of Torsade de Pointes reported (0.6%) during the controlled phase of treatment with Betapace AF. The incidence of Torsade de Pointes was significantly lower in those patients receiving total daily doses of 320 mg or less (0.3%), as summarized in Table 5 below. Both patients who had Torsade de Pointes in the group receiving &gt;320 mg/day were receiving 640 mg/day. In the group receiving &lt;=320 mg daily, one case of TdP occurred at a daily dose of 320 mg on day 4 of treatment and one case occurred on a daily dose of 160 mg on day 1 of treatment.

            Prolongation of the QT interval is dose related, increasing from baseline an average of 25, 40, and 50 msec in the 80, 120, and 160 mg groups, respectively, in the clinical dose-response study. In this clinical trial Betapace AF treatment was not initiated if the QT interval was greater than 450 msec and during therapy the dose was reduced or discontinued if the QT interval was &gt;=520 msec.
 

 Experience in patients with ventricular arrhythmias is also pertinent to the risk of Torsade de Pointes in patients with AFIB/AFL (see below).



    Proarrhythmia in Ventricular Arrhythmia Patients: [see Betapace (sotalol hydrochloride) Package Insert]



  In patients with a history of sustained ventricular tachycardia, the incidence of Torsade de Pointes during sotalol treatment was 4% and worsened VT in about 1%; in patients with other less serious ventricular arrhythmias the incidence of Torsade de Pointes was 1% and new or worsened VT in about 0.7%. Additionally, in approximately 1% of patients, deaths were considered possibly drug related; such cases, although difficult to evaluate, may have been associated with proarrhythmic events.



 Torsade de Pointes arrhythmias in patients with VT/VF were dose related, as was the prolongation of QT (QTc) interval, as shown in Table 6 below.

         Table 7 below relates the incidence of Torsade de Pointes to on-therapy QTcand change in QTcfrom baseline. It should be noted, however, that the highest on therapy QTcwas in many cases the one obtained at the time of the Torsade de Pointes event, so that the table overstates the predictive value of a high QTc.

          In addition to dose and presence of sustained VT, other risk factors for Torsade de Pointes were gender (females had a higher incidence), excessive prolongation of the QTcinterval and history of cardiomegaly or congestive heart failure. Patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia and a history of congestive heart failure appear to have the highest risk for serious proarrhythmia (7%). Of the ventricular arrhythmia patients experiencing Torsade de Pointes, approximately two-thirds spontaneously reverted to their baseline rhythm. The others were either converted electrically (D/C cardioversion or overdrive pacing) or treated with other drugs (see  OVERDOSAGE  ). It is not possible to determine whether some sudden deaths represented episodes of Torsade de Pointes, but in some instances sudden death did follow a documented episode of Torsade de Pointes. Although sotalol therapy was discontinued in most patients experiencing Torsade de Pointes, 17% were continued on a lower dose.
 

    Use with Drugs that Prolong QT Interval and Antiarrhythmic Agents



  The use of Betapace AF in conjunction with other drugs that prolong the QT interval has not been studied and is not recommended. Such drugs include many antiarrhythmics, some phenothiazines, bepridil, tricyclic antidepressants, and certain oral macrolides. Class I or Class III antiarrhythmic agents should be withheld for at least three half-lives prior to dosing with Betapace AF. In clinical trials, Betapace AF was not administered to patients previously treated with oral amiodarone for &gt;1 month in the previous three months. Class Ia antiarrhythmic drugs, such as disopyramide, quinidine and procainamide and other Class III drugs (e.g., amiodarone) are not recommended as concomitant therapy with Betapace AF because of their potential to prolong refractoriness (see  WARNINGS  ). There is only limited experience with the concomitant use of Class Ib or Ic antiarrhythmics.



    Congestive Heart Failure



  Sympathetic stimulation is necessary in supporting circulatory function in congestive heart failure, and beta-blockade carries the potential hazard of further depressing myocardial contractility and precipitating more severe failure. In patients who have heart failure controlled by digitalis and/or diuretics, Betapace AF should be administered cautiously. Both digitalis and sotalol slow AV conduction. As with all beta-blockers, caution is advised when initiating therapy in patients with any evidence of left ventricular dysfunction. In a pooled data base of four placebo-controlled AFIB/AFL and PSVT studies, new or worsening CHF occurred during therapy with Betapace AF in 5 (1.2%) of 415 patients. In these studies patients with uncontrolled heart failure were excluded (i.e., NYHA Functional Classes III or IV). In other premarketing sotalol studies, new or worsened congestive heart failure (CHF) occurred in 3.3% (n=3257) of patients and led to discontinuation in approximately 1% of patients receiving sotalol. The incidence was higher in patients presenting with sustained ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (4.6%, n=1363), or a prior history of heart failure (7.3%, n=696). Based on a life-table analysis, the one-year incidence of new or worsened CHF was 3% in patients without a prior history and 10% in patients with a prior history of CHF. NYHA Classification was also closely associated to the incidence of new or worsened heart failure while receiving sotalol (1.8% in 1395 Class I patients, 4.9% in 1254 Class II patients and 6.1% in 278 Class III or IV patients).



    Electrolyte Disturbances



  Betapace AF should not be used in patients with hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia prior to correction of imbalance, as these conditions can exaggerate the degree of QT prolongation, and increase the potential for Torsade de Pointes. Special attention should be given to electrolyte and acid-base balance in patients experiencing severe or prolonged diarrhea or patients receiving concomitant diuretic drugs.



    Bradycardia/Heart Block



  The incidence of bradycardia (as determined by the investigators) in the supraventricular arrhythmia population treated with Betapace AF (N = 415) was 13%, and led to discontinuation in 2.4% of patients. Bradycardia itself increases the risk of Torsade de Pointes.



    Recent Acute MI



  Sotalol has been used in a controlled trial following an acute myocardial infarction without evidence of increased mortality (see   Safety in Patients with Structural Heart Disease    ). Although specific studies of its use in treating atrial arrhythmias after infarction have not been conducted, the usual precautions regarding heart failure, avoidance of hypokalemia, bradycardia or prolonged QT interval apply.



    The following warnings are related to the beta-blocking activity of Betapace AF.



   Abrupt Withdrawal



  Hypersensitivity to catecholamines has been observed in patients withdrawn from beta-blocker therapy. Occasional cases of exacerbation of angina pectoris, arrhythmias and, in some cases, myocardial infarction have been reported after abrupt discontinuation of beta-blocker therapy. Therefore, it is prudent when discontinuing chronically administered Betapace AF, particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease, to carefully monitor the patient and consider the temporary use of an alternate beta-blocker if appropriate. If possible, the dosage of Betapace AF should be gradually reduced over a period of one to two weeks. If angina or acute coronary insufficiency develops, appropriate therapy should be instituted promptly. Patients should be warned against interruption or discontinuation of therapy without the physician's advice. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized in patients receiving Betapace AF, abrupt discontinuation in patients with arrhythmias may unmask latent coronary insufficiency.



    Non-Allergic Bronchospasm (e.g., chronic bronchitis and emphysema)



   PATIENTS WITH BRONCHOSPASTIC DISEASES SHOULD IN GENERAL NOT RECEIVE BETA-BLOCKERS.  It is prudent, if Betapace AF (sotalol hydrochloride) is to be administered, to use the smallest effective dose, so that inhibition of bronchodilation produced by endogenous or exogenous catecholamine stimulation of beta2receptors may be minimized.



    Anaphylaxis



  While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may have a more severe reaction on repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat the allergic reaction.



    Major Surgery



  Chronically administered beta-blocking therapy should not be routinely withdrawn prior to major surgery, however the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures.



    Diabetes



  In patients with diabetes (especially labile diabetes) or with a history of episodes of spontaneous hypoglycemia, Betapace AF should be given with caution since beta-blockade may mask some important premonitory signs of acute hypoglycemia; e.g., tachycardia.



    Sick Sinus Syndrome



  Betapace AF should be used only with extreme caution in patients with sick sinus syndrome associated with symptomatic arrhythmias, because it may cause sinus bradycardia, sinus pauses or sinus arrest. In patients with AFIB and sinus node dysfunction, the risk of Torsade de Pointes with Betapace AF therapy is increased, especially after cardioversion. Bradycardia following cardioversion in these patients is associated with QTcinterval prolongation which is augmented due to the reverse use dependence of the Class III effects of Betapace AF. Patients with AFIB/AFL associated with the sick sinus syndrome may be treated with Betapace AF if they have an implanted pacemaker for control of bradycardia symptoms.



    Thyrotoxicosis



  Beta-blockade may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Patients suspected of developing thyrotoxicosis should be managed carefully to avoid abrupt withdrawal of beta-blockade which might be followed by an exacerbation of symptoms of hyperthyroidism, including thyroid storm. The beta-blocking effects of Betapace AF may be useful in controlling heart rate in AFIB associated with thyrotoxicosis but no study has been conducted to evaluate this.
