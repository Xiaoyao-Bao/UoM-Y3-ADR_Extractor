  6.1 Clinical Studies Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 Use of Precedex has been associated with the following serious adverse reactions:



 *    Hypotension, bradycardia and sinus arrest [  see      Warnings and Precautions (5.2)   ] 
 *    Transient hypertension [  see      Warnings and Precautions (5.3)   ] 
    Most common treatment-emergent adverse reactions, occurring in greater than 2% of patients in both Intensive Care Unit and procedural sedation studies include hypotension, bradycardia and dry mouth.
 

     Intensive Care Unit Sedation    



 Adverse reaction information is derived from the continuous infusion trials of Precedex for sedation in the Intensive Care Unit setting in which 1007 adult patients received Precedex. The mean total dose was 7.4 mcg/kg (range: 0.8 to 84.1), mean dose per hour was 0.5 mcg/kg/hr (range: 0.1 to 6.0) and the mean duration of infusion of 15.9 hours (range: 0.2 to 157.2). The population was between 17 to 88 years of age, 43% &gt;=65 years of age, 77% male and 93% Caucasian. Treatment-emergent adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of &gt;2% are provided in  Table 2  . The most frequent adverse reactions were hypotension, bradycardia and dry mouth [    see         Warnings and Precautions (5.2)    ].

              Procedural Sedation    
 

 Adverse reaction information is derived from the two trials for procedural sedation [  see  Clinical Studies (14.2)    ] in which 318 adult patients received Precedex. The mean total dose was 1.6 mcg/kg (range: 0.5 to 6.7), mean dose per hour was 1.3 mcg/kg/hr (range: 0.3 to 6.1) and the mean duration of infusion of 1.5 hours (range: 0.1 to 6.2). The population was between 18 to 93 years of age, ASA I-IV, 30% &gt;=65 years of age, 52% male and 61% Caucasian.



 Treatment-emergent adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of &gt;2% are provided in  Table 6  . The most frequent adverse reactions were hypotension, bradycardia, and dry mouth [    see         Warnings and Precautions (5.2)    ]. Pre-specified criteria for the vital signs to be reported as adverse reactions are footnoted below the table. The decrease in respiratory rate and hypoxia was similar between Precedex and comparator groups in both studies.

           6.2 Postmarketing Experience
   The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Precedex. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 Hypotension and bradycardia were the most common adverse reactions associated with the use of Precedex during post approval use of the drug.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *    Monitoring: Continuously monitor patients while receiving Precedex. (  5.1  ) 
 *    Bradycardia and Sinus Arrest: Have occurred in young healthy volunteers with high vagal tone or with different routes of administration, e.g., rapid intravenous or bolus administration. (  5.2  ) 
 *    Hypotension and Bradycardia: May necessitate medical intervention. May be more pronounced in patients with hypovolemia, diabetes mellitus, or chronic hypertension, and in the elderly. Use with caution in patients with advanced heart block or severe ventricular dysfunction. (  5.2  ) 
 *    Co-administration with Other Vasodilators or Negative Chronotropic Agents: Use with caution due to additive pharmacodynamic effects. (  5.2  ) 
 *    Transient Hypertension: Observed primarily during the loading dose. Consider reduction in loading infusion rate. (  5.3  ) 
 *    Arousability: Patients can become aroused/alert with stimulation; this alone should not be considered as lack of efficacy. (  5.4  ) 
 *    Prolonged exposure to dexmedetomidine beyond 24 hours may be associated with tolerance and tachyphylaxis and a dose-related increase in adverse events. (  5.6  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Drug Administration



  Precedex should be administered only by persons skilled in the management of patients in the intensive care or operating room setting. Due to the known pharmacological effects of Precedex, patients should be continuously monitored while receiving Precedex.



    5.2 Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Sinus Arrest



  Clinically significant episodes of bradycardia and sinus arrest have been reported with Precedex administration in young, healthy adult volunteers with high vagal tone or with different routes of administration including rapid intravenous or bolus administration.



 Reports of hypotension and bradycardia have been associated with Precedex infusion. Some of these cases have resulted in fatalities. If medical intervention is required, treatment may include decreasing or stopping the infusion of Precedex, increasing the rate of intravenous fluid administration, elevation of the lower extremities, and use of pressor agents. Because Precedex has the potential to augment bradycardia induced by vagal stimuli, clinicians should be prepared to intervene. The intravenous administration of anticholinergic agents (e.g., glycopyrrolate, atropine) should be considered to modify vagal tone. In clinical trials, glycopyrrolate or atropine were effective in the treatment of most episodes of Precedex-induced bradycardia. However, in some patients with significant cardiovascular dysfunction, more advanced resuscitative measures were required.



 Caution should be exercised when administering Precedex to patients with advanced heart block and/or severe ventricular dysfunction. Because Precedex decreases sympathetic nervous system activity, hypotension and/or bradycardia may be expected to be more pronounced in patients with hypovolemia, diabetes mellitus, or chronic hypertension and in elderly patients.



 In clinical trials where other vasodilators or negative chronotropic agents were co-administered with Precedex an additive pharmacodynamic effect was not observed. Nonetheless, caution should be used when such agents are administered concomitantly with Precedex.



    5.3 Transient Hypertension



  Transient hypertension has been observed primarily during the loading dose in association with the initial peripheral vasoconstrictive effects of Precedex. Treatment of the transient hypertension has generally not been necessary, although reduction of the loading infusion rate may be desirable.



    5.4 Arousability



  Some patients receiving Precedex have been observed to be arousable and alert when stimulated. This alone should not be considered as evidence of lack of efficacy in the absence of other clinical signs and symptoms.



    5.5 Withdrawal



    Intensive Care Unit Sedation    



 With administration up to 7 days, regardless of dose, 12 (5%) Precedex adult subjects experienced at least 1 event related to withdrawal within the first 24 hours after discontinuing study drug and 7 (3%) Precedex adult subjects experienced at least 1 event 24 to 48 hours after end of study drug. The most common events were nausea, vomiting, and agitation.



 In adult subjects, tachycardia and hypertension requiring intervention in the 48 hours following study drug discontinuation occurred at frequencies of &lt;5%. If tachycardia and/or hypertension occurs after discontinuation of Precedex supportive therapy is indicated.



   Procedural Sedation    



 In adult subjects, withdrawal symptoms were not seen after discontinuation of short term infusions of Precedex (&lt;6 hours).



    5.6 Tolerance and Tachyphylaxis



  Use of dexmedetomidine beyond 24 hours has been associated with tolerance and tachyphylaxis and a dose-related increase in adverse reactions [  see        Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ].



    5.7 Hepatic Impairment



  Since Precedex clearance decreases with severity of hepatic impairment, dose reduction should be considered in patients with impaired hepatic function [  see        Dosage and Administration (2.2)    ].
