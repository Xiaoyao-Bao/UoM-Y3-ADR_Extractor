  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The most common incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (&gt;=3.0%) in subjects from clinical trials was constipation, diarrhea, nausea, somnolence, anorexia, dizziness, and sweating increased.



   T    a    ble    1  shows the incidence rate of treatment-emergent adverse events reported in &gt;=2.0% of subjects over five days of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets use in clinical trials (subjects took an average of at least 6 tablets per day).

   6.2   Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of tramadol-containing products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Serotonin syndrome  : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs.



   A    drenal insufficiency  : Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use.



   A    naphylaxis  : Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets.



   A    ndrogen deficiency  : Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with chronic use of opioids  [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]  .



   QT prolongation/torsade de pointes:  Cases of QT prolongation and/or torsade de pointes have been reported with tramadol use. Many of these cases were reported in patients taking another drug labeled for QT prolongation, in patients with a risk factor for QT prolongation (e.g., hypokalemia), or in the overdoes setting.



   Eye disorders -  miosis, mydriasis



   Me    tabolism and nutrition disorders  - Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported very rarely in patients taking tramadol. Most reports were in patients with predisposing risk factors, including diabetes or renal insufficiency, or in elderly patients.



   N    e    rvous system disorders  - movement disorder, speech disorder



   Psychiatric disorders  - delirium



   Other clinically significant adverse experiences previously reported with tramadol hydrochloride:  



 Other events which have been reported with the use of tramadol products and for which a causal association has not been determined include: vasodilation, orthostatic hypotension, myocardial ischemia,  pulmonary   edema,  allergic reactions  (including anaphylaxis  and  urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome/TENS), cognitive dysfunction, difficulty concentrating, depression, suicidal tendency, hepatitis, liver failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Reported laboratory abnormalities included elevated creatinine and liver function tests. Serotonin syndrome (whose symptoms may include mental status change, hyperreflexia, fever, shivering, tremor, agitation, diaphoresis, seizures, and coma) has been reported with tramadol when used concomitantly with other serotonergic agents such as SSRIs and MAOIs.

Assess each patient's risk prior to prescribing tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets, and monitor all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors and conditions   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )]  .  



      



     L        ife-Threatening Respiratory Depression    



   S    er    ious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets.  Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets or following a dose increase   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )].    



          



     Accidental Ingestion    



   Accidental ingestion of even one dose of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of tramadol   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )]  .  



      



     Ultra-Rapid Metabolism of Tramadol and Other Risk Factors for Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Children    



   Life-threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received tramadol. Some of the reported cases occurred following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy, and in at least one case, the child had evidence of being an ultra-rapid metabolizer of tramadol due to a CYP2D6 polymorphism   [see Warnings and Precautions (5  .3  )].   Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets are contraindicated in children younger than 12 years of age and in children younger than 18 years of age following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy   [see    Contraindications (  4  )].   Avoid the use of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets in adolescents 12 to 18 years of age who have other risk factors that may increase their sensitivity to the respiratory depressant effects of tramadol   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  )]  .  



      



     Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome    



   Pr    olonged use of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available   [    see Warnings and Precautions (  5.4  )]  .  



      



     Interactions with Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes    



   Th    e effects of concomitant use or discontinuation of cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers,    3A4 inhibitors, or 2D6 inhibitors with tramadol are complex.  Use of cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, 3A4 inhibitors, or 2D6 inhibitors with tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets requires careful consideration of the effects on the parent drug, tramadol, and the active metabolite, M1   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.5  ), Drug Interactions (  7  )]  .  



      



     Hepatotoxicity    



   Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets    c    ontain tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen. Acetaminophen has been associated with cases of acute liver failure, at times resulting in liver transplant and death. Most of the cases of liver injury are associated with the use of acetaminophen at doses that exceed 4,000 milligrams per day, and often involve more than one acetaminophen-containing product   [    see Warnings and Precautions (  5.6  )].    



          



     Risks From Concomitant Use With Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants    



   Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death   [  see   Warnings and Precautions (  5.7  ), Drug Interactions (  7  )]  .

   5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse



  Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets contain tramadol, a Schedule IV controlled substance. As an opioid, tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets expose users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (  9  )].  



 Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused.



 Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets, and monitor all patients receiving tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets for the development of these behaviors and conditions.  Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse.



 Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion.  Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see Patient Counseling Information (  17  )]  .  Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.



    5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression



  Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended.  Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see Overdosage (  10  )]  . Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.



 While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24 to 72 hours of initiating therapy with and following dosage increases of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets.



 To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets are essential [see Dosage and Administration (  2  )]  . Overestimating the tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose.



 Accidental ingestion of even one dose of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of tramadol.



    5.3 Ultra-Rapid Metabolism of Tramadol and Other Risk Factors for Life-threatening Respiratory Depression in Children



  Life-threatening  respiratory  depression  and  death  have  occurred  in  children  who  received tramadol. Tramadol and codeine are subject to variability in metabolism based upon CYP2D6 genotype (described below), which can lead to increased exposure to an active metabolite.  Based upon postmarketing reports with tramadol or with codeine, children younger than 12 years of age may be more susceptible to the respiratory depressant effects of tramadol. Furthermore, children with obstructive sleep apnea who are treated with opioids for post-tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy pain may be particularly sensitive to their respiratory depressant effect. Because of the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression and death:



 *  Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets are contraindicated for all children younger than 12 years of age [see Contraindications (  4  )].  
 *  Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets are contraindicated for post-operative pain management in pediatric patients younger than 18 years of age following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy [see Contraindications (  4  )].  
 *  Avoid the use of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets in adolescents 12 to 18 years of age who have other risk factors that may increase their sensitivity to the respiratory depressant effects of tramadol unless the benefits outweigh the risks. Risk factors include conditions associated with hypoventilation such as postoperative status, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, sever pulmonary disease, neuromuscular disease, and concomitant use of other medications that cause respiratory depression. 
 *  As with adults, when prescribing opioids for adolescents, healthcare providers should choose the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time and inform patients and caregivers about these risks and the signs of opioid overdose [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.4  ), Overdosage (  10  )] . 
     N   ursing Mothers  
 

 Tramadol   is subject to the same polymorphic metabolism as codeine, with ultra-rapid metabolizers of CYP2D6 substrates being potentially exposed to life-threatening levels of O  -desmethyltramadol (M1). At least one death was reported in a nursing infant who was exposed to high levels of morphine in breast milk because the mother was an ultra-rapid metabolizer of codeine. A baby nursing from an ultra-rapid metabolizer mother taking tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets could potentially be exposed to high levels of M1, and experience life-threatening respiratory depression. For this reason, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets [ see Use in Specific Populations (  8.2  )  ].



  CY   P   2D6 Genetic Variability: Ultra-rapid metabolizer  



 Some individuals may be ultra-rapid metabolizers because of a specific CYP2D6 genotype (gene duplications denoted as *1/*1xN or *1/*2xN). The prevalence of this CYP2D6 phenotype varies widely and has been estimated at 1 to 10% for Whites (European, North American), 3 to 4% for Blacks (African Americans), 1 to 2% for East Asians (Chinese, Japanese, Korean), and may be greater than 10% in certain racial/ethnic groups (i.e., Oceanian, Northern African, Middle Eastern, Ashkenazi Jews, Puerto Rican). These individuals convert tramadol into its active metabolite, O  -desmethyltramadol (M1), more rapidly and completely than other people. This rapid conversion results in higher than expected serum M1 levels. Even at labeled dosage regimens, individuals who are ultra-rapid metabolizers may have life-threatening or fatal respiratory depression or experience signs of overdose (such as extreme sleepiness, confusion, or shallow breathing) [see Overdosage (  10  )].  Therefore, individuals who are ultra-rapid metabolizers should not use tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets.



    5.4 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome



  Prolonged use of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  ), Patient Counseling Information (  17  )]  .



    5.5 Risks of Interactions with Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes



  The effects of concomitant use or discontinuation of cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, 3A4 inhibitors, or 2D6 inhibitors on levels of tramadol and M1 from tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets are complex.  Use of cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, 3A4 inhibitors, or 2D6 inhibitors with tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets requires careful consideration of the effects on the parent drug, tramadol, which is a weak serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor and u-opioid agonist, and the active metabolite, M1, which is more potent than tramadol in u-opioid receptor binding [see Drug Interactions (  7  )]  .



  R   i   sks of Concomitant Use or Discontinuation of Cytochrome P450 2D6 Inhibitors   



 The concomitant use of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets with all cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibitors (e.g., amiodarone, quinidine) may result in an increase in tramadol plasma levels and a decrease in the levels of the active metabolite, M1. A decrease in M1 exposure in patients who have developed physical dependence to tramadol, may result in signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal and reduced efficacy. The effect of increased tramadol levels may be an increased risk for serious adverse events including seizures and serotonin syndrome.



 Discontinuation of a concomitantly used cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibitor may result in a decrease in tramadol plasma levels and an increase in active metabolite M1 levels, which could increase or prolong adverse reactions related to opioid toxicity and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.



 Follow patients receiving tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets and any CYP2D6 inhibitor for the risk of serious adverse events including seizures and serotonin syndrome, signs and symptoms that may reflect opioid toxicity, and opioid withdrawal when tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets are used in conjunction with inhibitors of CYP2D6 [see Drug Interactions (  7  )]  .



  C   ytochrome P450 3A4 Interaction  



 The concomitant use of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets with cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir) or discontinuation of a cytochrome P450 3A4 inducer such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may result in an increase in tramadol plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse reactions, increase the risk for serious adverse events including seizures and serotonin syndrome, and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.



 The concomitant use of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets with all cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers or discontinuation of a cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitor may result in lower tramadol levels. This may be associated with a decrease in efficacy, and in some patients, may result in signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal.



 Follow patients receiving tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets and any CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer for the risk for serious adverse events including seizures and serotonin syndrome, signs and symptoms that may reflect opioid toxicity and opioid withdrawal when tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets are used in conjunction with inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 [see Drug Interactions (  7  )]  .



    5.6 Hepatotoxicity



  Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets contain tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen. Acetaminophen has been associated with cases of acute liver failure, at times resulting in liver transplant and death. Most of the cases of liver injury are associated with the use of acetaminophen at doses that exceed 4,000 milligrams per day, and often involve more than one acetaminophen-containing product. The excessive intake of acetaminophen may be intentional to cause self-harm or unintentional as patients attempt to obtain more pain relief or unknowingly take other acetaminophen-containing products.



 The risk of acute liver failure is higher in individuals with underlying liver disease and in individuals who ingest alcohol while taking acetaminophen.



 Instruct patients to look for acetaminophen or APAP on package labels and not to use more than one product that contains acetaminophen. Instruct patients to seek medical attention immediately upon ingestion of more than 4,000 milligrams of acetaminophen per day, even if they feel well.



    5.7 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants



  Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.



 Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone.  Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions (  7  )]  .



 If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use.  In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.



 Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets are used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined.  Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [see Drug Interactions (  7  ), Patient Counseling Information (  17  )]  .



    5.8 Serotonin Syndrome Risk



  Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported with the use of tramadol, including tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets, during concomitant use with serotonergic drugs.



 Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including MAO inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue) [see Drug Interactions (  7  )]  . This may occur within the recommended dosage range.



 Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days of concomitant use, but may occur later than that. Discontinue tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected.



    5.9 Increased Risk of Seizures



  Seizures have been reported in patients receiving tramadol within the recommended dosage range. Spontaneous post-marketing reports indicate that seizure risk is increased with doses of tramadol above the recommended range.



 Concomitant use of tramadol increases the seizure risk in patients taking: [see Drug Interactions (  7  )]  .



 *  Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and Serotonin-norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors (SNRIs) antidepressants or anorectics, 
 *  Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and other tricyclic compounds (e.g., cyclobenzaprine, promethazine, etc.), 
 *  Other opioids, 
 *  MAO inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.8  ), Drug Interactions (  7  )]  
 *  Neuroleptics, or 
 *  Other drugs that reduce the seizure threshold. 
    Risk of seizures may also increase in patients with epilepsy, those with a history of seizures, or in patients with a recognized risk for seizure (such as head trauma, metabolic disorders, alcohol and drug withdrawal, CNS infections).
 

 In tramadol overdose, naloxone administration may increase the risk of seizure.



    5.10 Suicide Risk



    *  Do not prescribe tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets for patients who are suicidal or addiction-prone. Consideration should be given to the use of non-narcotic analgesics in patients who are suicidal or depressed [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (  9  )].  
 *  Prescribe tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets with caution for patients with a history of misuse and/or are currently taking CNS-active drugs including tranquilizers, or antidepressant drugs, or alcohol in excess, and patients who suffer from emotional disturbance or depression [see Drug Interactions (  7  )].  
 *  Inform patients not to exceed the recommended dose and to limit their intake of alcohol [see Dosage and Administration (  2  ), Warnings and Precautions (  5.6  ,  5.7  )] . 
       5.11 Adrenal Insufficiency
 

  Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure.  If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.



    5.12 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients



  The use of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated [see Contraindications (  4  )].  



  Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease:   Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )].  



  Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients:  Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics, or altered clearance, compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )].  



 Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets and when tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets are given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.7  ), Drug Interactions (  7  )]  . Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients.



    5.13 Severe Hypotension



  Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (  7  )].  Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets. In patients with circulatory shock, tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets in patients with circulatory shock.



    5.14 Risk of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness



  n patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets.



 Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury.  Avoid the use of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets in patients with impaired consciousness or coma.



    5.15 Serious Skin Reactions



  Rarely, acetaminophen   may   cause   serious   skin   reactions   such   as   acute   generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. Patients should be informed about the signs of serious skin reactions, and use of the drug should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity



    5.16 Risk of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions



  Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets are contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus [see Contraindications (  4  )].  



 The tramadol in tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi.  Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms.



    5.17 Anaphylaxis and Other Hypersensitivity Reactions



  Serious and rarely fatal anaphylactic reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with tramadol. When these events do occur it is often following the first dose. Other reported allergic reactions include pruritus, hives, bronchospasm, angioedema, toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Patients with a history of anaphylactoid reactions to tramadol and other opioids may be at increased risk and therefore should not receive tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets. If anaphylaxis or other hypersensitivity occurs, stop administration of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets immediately, discontinue tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets permanently, and do not rechallenge with any formulation of tramadol.  Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if they experience any symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction [see Contraindications (  4  ), Information for Patients (  17  )]  .



 There have been postmarketing reports of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis associated with the use of acetaminophen. Clinical signs included swelling of the face, mouth, and throat, respiratory distress, urticaria, rash, pruritus, and vomiting. There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergency medical attention. Instruct patients to discontinue tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets immediately and seek medical care if they experience these symptoms. Do not prescribe tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets for patients with acetaminophen allergy.



    5.18 Increased Risk of Hepatotoxicity with Concomitant Use of Other Acetaminophen-containing Products



  Due to the potential for acetaminophen hepatotoxicity at doses higher than the recommended dose, tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets should not be used concomitantly with other acetaminophen containing products.



    5.19 Withdrawal



  Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets.  In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms [see Drug Interactions (  7  )]  .



 When discontinuing tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets, in opioid-dependent patients, gradually taper the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (  2.4  )]  . Do not abruptly discontinue tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (  9.3  )]  .



    5.20 Driving and Operating Machinery



  Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery.  Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets and know how they will react to the medication [see Patient Counseling Information (  17  )].
