  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The safety of TRIPTODUR was evaluated in one uncontrolled, open-label single-arm clinical trial in which 44 children with central precocious puberty received two doses of TRIPTODUR and were observed for 12 months. The median age of the study population was 8 years (range 2-9 years) at treatment start; 88.6% of subjects were female, 59.1% were White, 27.3% were Black and 4.5% were Asian. Table 1 shows all the adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2 patients (&gt;=4.5%) during the open-label single-arm trial.

            Other Selected Adverse Reactions  :
 

     Injection Site Reactions  



 Injection site reactions occurring in patients immediately and/or 2 hours after injection include pain (45%), redness (14%), pruritus (2.3%) and swelling (2.3%).



     Psychiatric Disorders  



 Anxiety (2.3%) and mood altered (2.3%)



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 The following adverse reactions were reported from postmarketing experience of triptorelin in patients with CPP:



   Hypersensitivity Reactions:  Anaphylactic shock, anaphylactoid reaction, angioedema, urticaria.



   Cardiovascular:  Hypertension.



   Psychiatric:  Emotional lability, such as crying, irritability, impatience, anger, and aggression, has been observed with GnRH agonists, including triptorelin  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ];  Depression, including rare reports of suicidal ideation and attempt, has been reported for GnRH agonists in children treated for CPP. Many, but not all, of these patients had a history of psychiatric illness or other comorbidities with an increased risk of depression.



   Nervous System:  Convulsions  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  



   Vision Disorders:  Visual impairment, visual disturbance

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *   Initial Rise of Gonadotropins and Sex Steroid Levels: An increase in clinical signs and symptoms of puberty may be observed during the first 2- 4 weeks of therapy since gonadotropins and sex steroids rise above baseline because of the initial stimulatory effect of the drug. (  5.1  ) 
 *   Psychiatric events have been reported in patients taking GnRH agonists. Events include emotional lability, such as crying, irritability, impatience, anger, and aggression. Monitor for development or worsening of psychiatric symptoms. (  5.2  ) 
 *   Convulsions have been observed in patients with or without a history of seizures, epilepsy, cerebrovascular disorders, central nervous system anomalies or tumors, and in patients on concomitant medications that have been associated with convulsions. (  5.3  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Initial Rise of Gonadotropins and Sex Steroid Levels



  During the early phase of initial therapy or after subsequent doses, gonadotropins and sex steroids may rise above baseline because of a transient stimulatory effect of the drug [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)  ]  . Therefore, a transient increase in clinical signs and symptoms of puberty, including vaginal bleeding, may be observed during the first weeks of therapy or after subsequent doses.



    5.2 Psychiatric Events



  Psychiatric events have been reported in patients taking GnRH agonists, including triptorelin. Postmarketing reports with this class of drugs include symptoms of emotional lability, such as crying, irritability, impatience, anger, and aggression. Monitor for development or worsening of psychiatric symptoms during treatment with TRIPTODUR [see  Adverse Reactions (6)  ]  .



    5.3 Convulsions



  Postmarketing reports of convulsions have been observed in patients receiving GnRH agonists, including triptorelin. These included patients with a history of seizures, epilepsy, cerebrovascular disorders, central nervous system anomalies or tumors, and patients on concomitant medications that have been associated with convulsions such as bupropion and SSRIs. Convulsions have also been reported in patients in the absence of any of the conditions mentioned above [see  Adverse Reactions (6)  ]  .
