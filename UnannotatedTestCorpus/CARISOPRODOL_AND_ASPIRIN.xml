    To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sandoz Inc. at 1-800-525-8747 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or  www.fda.gov/medwatch  .  



 The following adverse reactions which have occurred with the administration of the individual products alone may also occur with the use of Carisoprodol and Aspirin Tablets. The following events have been reported during post-approval individual use of carisoprodol and aspirin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Carisoprodol

  The following events have been reported during post-approval use of carisoprodol. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Cardiovascular:  Tachycardia, postural hypotension, and facial flushing (see    OVERDOSAGE  ).  



   Central Nervous System:  Drowsiness, dizziness, vertigo, ataxia, tremor, agitation, irritability, headache, depressive reactions, syncope, insomnia, and seizures (see    OVERDOSAGE  ).  



   Gastrointestinal:  Nausea, vomiting, and epigastric discomfort.



   Hematologic:  Leukopenia, pancytopenia



   Aspirin

  The most common adverse reactions associated with the use of aspirin have been gastrointestinal, including abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, gastritis, and occult bleeding (see    WARNINGS  ,      Serious Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions        and    PRECAUTIONS  ,      Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions      ).  Other adverse reactions associated with the use of aspirin include elevated liver enzymes, rash, pruritus, purpura, intracranial hemorrhage, interstitial nephritis, acute renal failure, and tinnitus. Tinnitus may be a symptom of high serum salicylate levels (see    OVERDOSAGE  ).

   Patients with impaired renal or hepatic function  



 The safety and pharmacokinetics of Carisoprodol and Aspirin Tablets in patients with renal or hepatic impairment have not been evaluated.



    Carisoprodol



  Since carisoprodol is excreted by the kidney and is metabolized in the liver, caution should be exercised if carisoprodol is administered to patients with impaired renal or hepatic function. Carisoprodol is dialyzable by hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.



    Seizures



  There have been postmarketing reports of seizures in patients who received carisoprodol. Most of these cases have occurred in the setting of multiple drug overdoses (including drugs of abuse, illegal drugs, and alcohol) (see   OVERDOSAGE  ).  



   Aspirin    



    Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions



  In addition to serious gastrointestinal adverse reactions, the use of aspirin is also associated with gastritis, gastrointestinal erosions, abdominal pain, heartburn, vomiting, and nausea (see   WARNINGS  ,  Serious Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions  ).  



    Information for Patients



  Patients should be advised to contact their health care provider if they experience any adverse reactions to Carisoprodol and Aspirin Tablets.



    Carisoprodol



    *  1.  Patients should be advised that carisoprodol may cause drowsiness and/or dizziness, and has been associated with motor vehicle accidents. Patients should be advised to avoid taking carisoprodol before engaging in potentially hazardous activities such as driving a motor vehicle or operating machinery (see   WARNINGS  ,  Sedation  ).  
 *  2.  Patients should be advised to avoid alcoholic beverages while taking carisoprodol and to check with their doctor before taking other CNS depressants such as benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, sedating antihistamines, or other sedatives (see   WARNINGS  ,  Sedation  ).  
 *  3.  Patients should be advised that treatment with carisoprodol should be limited to acute use (up to two or three weeks) for the relief of acute, musculoskeletal discomfort. In the post-marketing experience with carisoprodol, cases of dependence, withdrawal, and abuse have been reported with prolonged use. If the musculoskeletal symptoms still persist, patients should contact their healthcare provider for further evaluation. 
      Aspirin    
 

 *  1.  Patients should be warned that aspirin can cause epigastric discomfort, gastric and duodenal ulcers, and serious GI adverse reactions, such as bleeding, perforation, and/or obstruction of the stomach or intestines, which may result in hospitalization and death. Although serious GI bleeding can occur without warning symptoms (e.g., hematemesis, melena, hematochezia), patients should be alert for these symptoms and should seek urgent medical care if any of these indicative symptoms occur (see   WARNINGS  ,  Serious Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions  ). In addition, patients should be alert for symptoms of ulcers (e.g., night time epigastric discomfort, vomiting, weight loss) and should seek medical attention if these symptoms occur. Patients who consume three or more alcoholic drinks every day should be counseled about the GI bleeding risks involved with the use of aspirin with alcohol. 
 *  2.  Patients should be informed of the symptoms of an anaphylactoid reaction or anaphylaxis (e.g., hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat). If these symptoms occur, patients should be instructed to seek immediate emergency help. 
       Drug Interactions
 

    Carisoprodol    



 The sedative effects of carisoprodol and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Therefore, caution should be exercised with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Concomitant use of carisoprodol and meprobamate, a metabolite of carisoprodol, is not recommended (see   WARNINGS  ,  Sedation  ).  



 Carisoprodol is metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 to form meprobamate (see   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  ).  Coadministration of CYP2C19 inhibitors, such as omeprazole or fluvoxamine, with carisoprodol could result in increased exposure of carisoprodol and decreased exposure of meprobamate. Co-administration of CYP2C19 inducers, such as rifampin or St. John's Wort, with carisoprodol could result in decreased exposure of carisoprodol and increased exposure of meprobamate. Low dose aspirin also showed an induction effect on CYP2C19. The full pharmacological impact of these potential alterations of exposures in terms of either efficacy or safety of carisoprodol is unknown.



   Aspirin    



 Clinically important interactions may occur when certain drugs or alcohol are administered concomitantly with aspirin.



  Alcohol:  Concomitant use of aspirin with &gt;= 3 alcoholic drinks may increase the risk of GI bleeding (see   WARNINGS  ,  Serious Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions  ).  



  Anticoagulants:  Concomitant use of aspirin with anticoagulants (e.g., heparin, warfarin, clopidogrel) increases the risk of GI bleeding (see   WARNINGS  ,  Serious Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions  ).  Additionally, aspirin can displace warfarin from protein binding sites, leading to prolongation of the international normalized ratio (INR).



  Antihypertensives:  The concomitant administration of aspirin with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-blockers, and diuretics may diminish the hypotensive effects of these anti-hypertensive products due to aspirin's inhibition of renal prostaglandins, which may lead to decreased renal blood flow and increased sodium and fluid retention. Concomitant use of aspirin and acetazolamide can lead to high serum concentrations of acetazolamide due to competition at the renal tubule for secretion.



  Corticosteroids:  Concomitant administration of aspirin and corticosteroids may decrease salicylate plasma levels.



  Methotrexate:  Aspirin may enhance the toxicity of methotrexate due to displacement of methotrexate from its plasma protein binding sites and/or reduction of the renal clearance of methotrexate.



  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs):  The concurrent use of aspirin with selective and nonselective NSAIDs increases the risk of serious GI adverse reactions (see   WARNINGS  ,  Serious Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions  ).  



  Oral Hypoglycemics Agents:  Aspirin may increase the serum glucose-lowering action of insulin and sulfonylureas leading to hypoglycemia.



  Products that effect urinary pH:  Ammonium chloride and other drugs that acidify the urine can elevate plasma salicylate concentrations. In contrast, antacids, by alkalinizing the urine, may decrease plasma salicylate concentrations.



  Uricosuric Agents:  Salicylates antagonize the uricosuric action of probenecid and sulfinpyrazone.



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility



  No long-term studies of carcinogenesis have been done with Carisoprodol and Aspirin Tablets.



   Carisoprodol    



 Long term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of carisoprodol.



 Carisoprodol was not formally evaluated for genotoxicity. In published studies, carisoprodol was mutagenic in the in vitro  mouse lymphoma cell assay in the absence of metabolizing enzymes, but was not mutagenic in the presence of metabolizing enzymes. Carisoprodol was clastogenic in the in vitro  chromosomal aberration assay using Chinese hamster ovary cells with or without the presence of metabolizing enzymes. Other types of genotoxic tests resulted in negative findings. Carisoprodol was not mutagenic in the Ames reverse mutation assay using S. typhimurium strains with or without metabolizing enzymes, and was not clastogenic in an in vivo  mouse micronucleus assay of circulating blood cells.



 Carisoprodol was not formally evaluated for effects on fertility. Published reproductive studies of carisoprodol in mice found no alteration in fertility although an alteration in reproductive cycles characterized by a greater time spent in estrus was observed at a carisoprodol dose of 1200 mg/kg/day. In a 13-week toxicology study that did not determine fertility, mouse testes weight and sperm motility were reduced at a dose of 1200 mg/kg/day. In both studies, the no effect level was 750 mg/kg/day, corresponding to approximately 2.6 times the human equivalent dosage of 350 mg four times a day, based on a body surface area comparison.



 The significance of these findings for human fertility is not known.



   Aspirin    



 Administration of aspirin for 68 weeks in the feed of rats was not carcinogenic. In the Ames Salmonella assay, aspirin was not mutagenic; however, aspirin did induce chromosome aberrations in cultured human fibroblasts. Aspirin has been shown to inhibit ovulation in rats (see   Pregnancy  .)  



    Pregnancy



    Pregnancy Category D  



  It is not known whether Carisoprodol and Aspirin Tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Adequate animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Carisoprodol and Aspirin Tablets. Carisoprodol and Aspirin Tablets should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.



    Carisoprodol



  There are no data on the use of carisoprodol during human pregnancy. Animal studies indicate that carisoprodol crosses the placenta and results in adverse effects on fetal growth and postnatal survival. The primary metabolite of carisoprodol, meprobamate, is an approved anxiolytic. Retrospective, post-marketing studies do not show a consistent association between maternal use of meprobamate and an increased risk for particular congenital malformations.



    Teratogenic effects



  Animal studies have not adequately evaluated the teratogenic effects of carisoprodol. There was no increase in the incidence of congenital malformations noted in reproductive studies in rats, rabbits, and mice treated with meprobamate. Retrospective, post-marketing studies of meprobamate during human pregnancy were equivocal for demonstrating an increased risk of congenital malformations following first trimester exposure. Across studies that indicated an increased risk, the types of malformations were inconsistent.



    Nonteratogenic effects



  In animal studies, carisoprodol reduced fetal weights, postnatal weight gain, and postnatal survival at maternal doses equivalent to 1 to 1.5 times the human dose (based on a body surface area comparison). Rats exposed to meprobamate in-utero showed behavioral alterations that persisted into adulthood. For children exposed to meprobamate in-utero, one study found no adverse effects on mental or motor development or IQ scores. Carisoprodol should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus.



    Aspirin



   Teratogenic effects



  Prior to 30 weeks gestation, aspirin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Starting at 30 weeks gestation, aspirin should be avoided by pregnant women as premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus which may result in fetal pulmonary hypertension and fetal death. Salicylate products have also been associated with alterations in maternal and neonatal hemostasis mechanisms, decreased birth weight, increased incidence of intracranial hemorrhage in premature infants, stillbirths, and neonatal death. Studies in rodents have shown salicylates to be teratogenic when given in early gestation, and embryocidal when given in later gestation in doses considerably greater than usual therapeutic doses in humans.



    Labor and Delivery



    Carisoprodol:    There is no information about the effects of carisoprodol on the mother and the fetus during labor and delivery.



   Aspirin:    Ingestion of aspirin within one week of delivery or during labor may prolong delivery or lead to excessive blood loss in the mother, fetus, or neonate. Prolonged labor due to prostaglandin inhibition has been reported with aspirin use.



    Nursing Mothers



    Carisoprodol    



 Very limited data in humans show that carisoprodol is present in breast milk and may reach concentrations two to four times the maternal plasma concentrations. In one case report, a breast-fed infant received about 4 to 6% of the maternal daily dose through breast milk and experienced no adverse effects. However, milk production was inadequate and the baby was supplemented with formula. In lactation studies in mice, female pup survival and pup weight at weaning were decreased. This information suggests that maternal use of carisoprodol may lead to reduced or less effective infant feeding (due to sedation) and/or decreased milk production. Caution should be exercised when carisoprodol is administered to a nursing woman.



   Aspirin    



 Nursing mothers should avoid the use of aspirin because salicylate is excreted in breast milk which may lead to bleeding in the infant.



    Pediatric use



  The efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of Carisoprodol and Aspirin Tablets in pediatric patients less than 16 years of age have not been established.



    Geriatric Use



  The efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of Carisoprodol and Aspirin Tablets in patients over 65 years old have not been established.

   Carisoprodol  



    Sedation



  Carisoprodol has sedative properties and may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a motor vehicle or operating machinery. There have been post-marketing reports of motor vehicle accidents associated with the use of carisoprodol.



 Since the sedative effects of carisoprodol and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive, appropriate caution should be exercised with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously.



    Drug Dependence, Withdrawal, and Abuse



  Carisoprodol has been subject to abuse, dependence, withdrawal, misuse, and criminal diversion (see   DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE    ). Abuse of carisoprodol poses a risk of overdose which may lead to death, CNS and respiratory depression, hypotension, seizures and other disorders (see   OVERDOSAGE    ). Post-marketing cases of carisoprodol abuse and dependence have been reported in patients with prolonged use and a history of drug abuse. Although most of these patients took other drugs of abuse, some patients solely abused carisoprodol. Withdrawal symptoms have been reported following abrupt cessation of carisoprodol after prolonged use. Reported withdrawal symptoms included insomnia, vomiting, abdominal cramps, headache, tremors, muscle twitching, ataxia, hallucinations, and psychosis. One of carisoprodol's metabolites, meprobamate (a controlled substance), may also cause dependence (see   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  ).  



 To reduce the risk of carisoprodol abuse, assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing. After prescribing, limit the length of treatment to three weeks for the relief of acute musculoskeletal discomfort, keep careful prescription records, monitor for signs of abuse and overdose, and educate patients and their families about abuse and on proper storage and disposal.



  Aspirin  



    Serious Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions



  Aspirin can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse reactions including bleeding, perforation, and obstruction of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. Aspirin-associated serious GI adverse reactions can occur anywhere along the GI tract, at any time, with or without warning symptoms. Patients at higher risk of aspirin-associated serious upper GI adverse reactions include patients with a history of aspirin-associated GI bleeding from ulcers (complicated ulcers), a history of aspirin-associated ulcers (uncomplicated ulcers), geriatric patients, patients with poor baseline health status, patients taking higher doses of aspirin, and patients taking concomitant anticoagulants, NSAIDs, and/or large amounts of alcohol. To minimize the risk for an aspirin-associated GI serious adverse reaction, the lowest effective aspirin dose should be used for the shortest possible duration.



    Anaphylaxis and Anaphylactoid Reactions



  Aspirin may cause an increased risk of serious anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reactions, which can occur in patients without known prior exposure to aspirin (see   CONTRAINDICATIONS  ).  Patients with a serious anaphalaxis or anaphylactoid reaction should receive emergency care.
