  The safety of Cetrotide  (r)  (cetrorelix acetate for injection) in 949 patients undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation in clinical studies was evaluated. Women were between 19 and 40 years of age (mean: 32). 94.0% of them were Caucasian. Cetrotide  (r)  was given in doses ranging from 0.1 mg to 5 mg as either a single or multiple dose.



 Table 3 shows systemic adverse events, reported in clinical studies without regard to causality, from the beginning of Cetrotide  (r)  treatment until confirmation of pregnancy by ultrasound at an incidence &gt;= 1% in Cetrotide  (r)  treated subjects undergoing COS.

        Local site reactions (e.g. redness, erythema, bruising, itching, swelling, and pruritus) were reported. Usually, they were of a transient nature, mild intensity and short duration. During post-marketing surveillance, cases of mild to moderate Ovarian Hyperstimulation syndrome and infrequent cases of hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactoid reactions have been reported.
 

 Two stillbirths were reported in Phase 3 studies of Cetrotide  (r)  .



   Congenital Anomalies

  Clinical follow-up studies of 316 newborns of women administered Cetrotide  (r)  were reviewed. One infant of a set of twin neonates was found to have anencephaly at birth and died after four days. The other twin was normal. Developmental findings from ongoing baby follow-up included a child with a ventricular septal defect and another child with bilateral congenital glaucoma.



 Four pregnancies that resulted in therapeutic abortion in Phase 2 and Phase 3 controlled ovarian stimulation studies had major anomalies (diaphragmatic hernia, trisomy 21, Klinefelter syndrome, polymalformation, and trisomy 18). In three of these four cases, intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) was the fertilization method employed; in the fourth case,  in vitro  fertilization (IVF) was the method employed.



 The minor congenital anomalies reported include: supernumerary nipple, bilateral strabismus, imperforate hymen, congenital nevi, hemangiomata, and QT syndrome.



 The causal relationship between the reported anomalies and Cetrotide  (r)  is unknown. Multiple factors, genetic and others (including, but not limited to ICSI, IVF, gonadotropins, and progesterone) make causal attribution difficult to study.

   General



  Cases of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactoid reactions with the first dose, have been reported during post-marketing surveillance (see  ADVERSE REACTIONS  ). A severe anaphylactic reaction associated with cough, rash, and hypotension, was observed in one patient after seven months of treatment with Cetrotide  (r)  (10 mg/day) in a study for an indication unrelated to infertility.



 Special care should be taken in women with signs and symptoms of active allergic conditions or known history of allergic predisposition. Treatment with Cetrotide  (r)  is not advised in women with severe allergic conditions.



    Information for Patients



  Prior to therapy with Cetrotide  (r)  (cetrorelix acetate for injection), patients should be informed of the duration of treatment and monitoring procedures that will be required. The risk of possible adverse reactions should be discussed (see  ADVERSE REACTIONS  ). Cetrotide  (r)  should not be prescribed if a patient is pregnant.



 If Cetrotide  (r)  is prescribed to patients for self-administration, information for proper use is given in the Patient Leaflet (see below).



    Laboratory Tests



  After the exclusion of preexisting conditions, enzyme elevations (ALT, AST, GGT, alkaline phosphatase) were found in 1-2% of patients receiving Cetrotide  (r)  during controlled ovarian stimulation. The elevations ranged up to three times the upper limit of normal. The clinical significance of these findings was not determined.



 During stimulation with human menopausal gonadotropin, Cetrotide  (r)  had no notable effects on hormone levels aside from inhibition of LH surges.



    Drug Interactions



  No formal drug interaction studies have been performed with Cetrotide  (r)  .



    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility



  Long-term carcinogenicity studies in animals have not been performed with cetrorelix acetate. Cetrorelix acetate was not genotoxic in vitro  (Ames test, HPRT test, chromosome aberration test) or in vivo  (chromosome aberration test, mouse micronucleus test). Cetrorelix acetate induced polyploidy in CHL-Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts, but not in V79-Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts, cultured peripheral human lymphocytes or in an in vitro  micronucleus test in the CHL-cell line. Treatment with 0.46 mg/kg cetrorelix acetate for 4 weeks resulted in complete infertility in female rats which was reversed 8 weeks after cessation of treatment.



    Pregnancy



   (see  CONTRAINDICATIONS  )  



 Cetrotide  (r)  is contraindicated in pregnant women.



 When administered to rats for the first seven days of pregnancy, cetrorelix acetate did not affect the development of the implanted conceptus at doses up to 38 mug/kg (approximately 1 times the recommended human therapeutic dose based on body surface area). However, a dose of 139 mug/kg (approximately 4 times the human dose) resulted in a resorption rate and a postimplantation loss of 100%. When administered from day 6 to near term to pregnant rats and rabbits, very early resorptions and total implantation losses were seen in rats at doses from 4.6 mug/kg (0.2 times the human dose) and in rabbits at doses from 6.8 mug/kg (0.4 times the human dose). In animals that maintained their pregnancy, there was no increase in the incidence of fetal abnormalities.



 The fetal resorption observed in animals is a logical consequence of the alteration in hormonal levels effected by the antigonadotrophic properties of Cetrotide  (r)  , which could result in fetal loss in humans as well. Therefore, this drug should not be used in pregnant women.



    Nursing Mothers



  It is not known whether Cetrotide  (r)  is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because the effects of Cetrotide  (r)  on lactation and/or the breast-fed child have not been determined, Cetrotide  (r)  should not be used by nursing mothers.



    Geriatric Use



  Cetrotide  (r)  is not intended to be used in subjects aged 65 and over.

    <Section id="S3" name="warnings">    WARNINGS



  Cetrotide  (r)  (cetrorelix acetate for injection) should be prescribed by physicians who are experienced in fertility treatment. Before starting treatment with Cetrotide  (r)  , pregnancy must be excluded (see  CONTRAINDICATIONS  and  PRECAUTIONS  ).
