  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



   Table 1  lists adverse reactions that occurred in worldwide placebo-controlled clinical trials in 3,419 patients with migraine. Only treatment-emergent adverse reactions that occurred at a frequency of 1% or more in the group treated with IMITREX nasal spray 20 mg and that occurred at a frequency greater than the placebo group are included in  Table 1  .

           The incidence of adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender, weight, or age of the patients; use of prophylactic medications; or presence of aura. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions.
 

   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of IMITREX tablets, IMITREX nasal spray, and IMITREX injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or causal connection to IMITREX or a combination of these factors.



   Cardiovascular  



 Hypotension, palpitations.



   Neurological  



 Dystonia, tremor.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *    Myocardial ischemia/infarction and Prinzmetal's angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. (  5.1  ) 
 *    Arrhythmias: Discontinue IMITREX if occurs. (  5.2  ) 
 *    Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk. (  5.3  ) 
 *    Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue IMITREX if occurs. (  5.4  ) 
 *    Gastrointestinal ischemic reactions and peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue IMITREX if occurs. (  5.5  ) 
 *    Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary. (  5.6  ) 
 *    Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue IMITREX if occurs. (  5.7  ) 
 *    Seizures: Use with caution in patients with epilepsy or a lowered seizure threshold. (  5.11  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina



  The use of IMITREX nasal spray is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of IMITREX nasal spray. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. IMITREX nasal spray may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's angina), even in patients without a history of CAD.



 Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving IMITREX nasal spray. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, IMITREX nasal spray is contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of IMITREX nasal spray in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of IMITREX nasal spray. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of IMITREX nasal spray.



    5.2 Arrhythmias



  Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1agonists. Discontinue IMITREX nasal spray if these disturbances occur. IMITREX nasal spray is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders.



    5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure



  Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw may occur after treatment with IMITREX nasal spray and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of IMITREX nasal spray is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal's variant angina.



    5.4 Cerebrovascular Events



  Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue IMITREX nasal spray if a cerebrovascular event occurs.



 Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. IMITREX nasal spray is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA.



    5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions



  IMITREX nasal spray may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud's syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT1agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before using additional IMITREX nasal spray.



 Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1agonists has not been clearly established.



    5.6 Medication Overuse Headache



  Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary.



    5.7 Serotonin Syndrome



  Serotonin syndrome may occur with IMITREX nasal spray, particularly during coadministration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (  7.4  )]  . Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue IMITREX nasal spray if serotonin syndrome is suspected.



    5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure



  Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT1agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with IMITREX. IMITREX nasal spray is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension.



    5.9 Local Irritation



  Local irritative symptoms such as burning, numbness, paresthesia, discharge, and pain or soreness were reported in approximately 5% of patients in controlled clinical trials and were noted to be severe in about 1%. The symptoms were transient and generally resolved in less than 2 hours. Limited examinations of the nose and throat did not reveal any clinically noticeable injury in these patients. The consequences of extended and repeated use of IMITREX nasal spray on the nasal and/or respiratory mucosa have not been systematically evaluated in patients.



    5.10 Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions



  Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving IMITREX. Such reactions can be life-threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. IMITREX nasal spray is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to IMITREX.



    5.11 Seizures



  Seizures have been reported following administration of IMITREX. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. IMITREX nasal spray should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold.
