  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of ORBACTIV cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 ORBACTIV has been evaluated in two, double-blind, controlled ABSSSI clinical trials, which included 976 adult patients treated with a single 1200 mg intravenous dose of ORBACTIV and 983 patients treated with intravenous vancomycin for 7 to 10 days. The median age of patients treated with ORBACTIV was 45.6 years, ranging between 18 and 89 years of age with 8.8% &gt;=65 years of age. Patients treated with ORBACTIV were predominantly male (65.4%), 64.4% were Caucasian, 5.8% were African American, and 28.1% were Asian. Safety was evaluated for up to 60 days after dosing.



 In the pooled ABSSSI clinical trials, serious adverse reactions were reported in 57/976 (5.8%) patients treated with ORBACTIV and 58/983 (5.9%) treated with vancomycin. The most commonly reported serious adverse reaction was cellulitis in both treatment groups: 11/976 (1.1%) in ORBACTIV and 12/983 (1.2%) in the vancomycin arms, respectively.



 The most commonly reported adverse reactions (&gt;=3%) in patients receiving a single 1200 mg dose of ORBACTIV in the pooled ABSSSI clinical trials were: headache, nausea, vomiting, limb and subcutaneous abscesses, and diarrhea.



 In the pooled ABSSSI clinical trials, ORBACTIV was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 36/976 (3.7%) of patients; the most common reported reactions leading to discontinuation were cellulitis (4/976, 0.4%) and osteomyelitis (3/976, 0.3%).



 Table 1 provides selected adverse reactions occurring in &gt;=1.5% of patients receiving ORBACTIV in the pooled ABSSSI clinical trials. There were 540 (55.3%) patients in the ORBACTIV arm and 559 (56.9%) patients in the vancomycin arm, who reported &gt;=1 adverse reaction.

    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Coagulation test interference: ORBACTIV has been shown to artificially prolong aPTT for up to 120 hours, and may prolong PT and INR for up to 12 hours and ACT for up to 24 hours. For patients who require aPTT monitoring within 120 hours of ORBACTIV dosing, consider a non-phospholipid dependent coagulation test such as a Factor Xa (chromogenic) assay or an alternative anticoagulant not requiring aPTT. (  5.1  ,  7.2  ) 
 *  Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with the use of antibacterial agents including ORBACTIV. Discontinue infusion if signs of acute hypersensitivity occur. Monitor closely patients with known hypersensitivity to glycopeptides. (  5.2  ) 
 *  Infusion Related Reactions: Administer ORBACTIV over 3 hours to minimize infusion-related reactions. Stopping or slowing the infusion may result in cessation of these reactions. (  5.3  ) 
 *   Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea: Evaluate patients if diarrhea occurs. (  5.4  ) 
 *  Concomitant warfarin use: ORBACTIV has been shown to artificially prolong PT/INR for up to 12 hours (  5.1  ). Patients should be monitored for bleeding if concomitantly receiving ORBACTIV and warfarin. (  5.5  ) 
 *  Osteomyelitis: Institute appropriate alternate antibacterial therapy in patients with confirmed or suspected osteomyelitis. (  5.6  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Coagulation Test Interference



  ORBACTIV has been shown to artificially prolong aPTT for up to 120 hours, PT and INR for up to 12 hours, and activated clotting time (ACT) for up to 24 hours following administration of a single 1200 mg dose by binding to and preventing action of the phospholipid reagents commonly used in laboratory coagulation tests. ORBACTIV has also been shown to elevate D-dimer concentrations up to 72 hours after ORBACTIV administration.



 For patients who require aPTT monitoring within 120 hours of ORBACTIV dosing, a non-phospholipid dependent coagulation test such as a Factor Xa (chromogenic) assay or an alternative anticoagulant not requiring aPTT monitoring may be considered [see  Contraindications (4.1)  and  Drug Interactions (7.2)  ]  .



 ORBACTIV has no effect on the coagulation system in vivo.



    5.2 Hypersensitivity



  Serious hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with the use of ORBACTIV. If an acute hypersensitivity reaction occurs during ORBACTIV infusion, discontinue ORBACTIV immediately and institute appropriate supportive care. Before using ORBACTIV, inquire carefully about previous hypersensitivity reactions to glycopeptides. Due to the possibility of cross-sensitivity, carefully monitor for signs of hypersensitivity during ORBACTIV infusion in patients with a history of glycopeptide allergy. In the Phase 3 ABSSSI clinical trials, the median onset of hypersensitivity reactions in ORBACTIV-treated patients was 1.2 days and the median duration of these reactions was 2.4 days [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



    5.3 Infusion Related Reactions



   ORBACTIV is administered via intravenous infusion, using a total infusion time of 3 hours to minimize the risk of infusion-related reactions. Infusion related reactions have been reported with the glycopeptide class of antimicrobial agents, including ORBACTIV, that resemble "Red-man Syndrome", including flushing of the upper body, urticaria, pruritus and/or rash. Stopping or slowing the infusion may result in cessation of these reactions [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .  



    5.4 Clostridium difficile-associated Diarrhea



   Clostridium difficile  -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported for nearly all systemic antibacterial drugs, including ORBACTIV, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of C. difficile  .



  C. difficile  produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile  cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antibacterial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary because CDAD has been reported to occur more than 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents.



 If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, antibacterial use not directed against C. difficile  may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile  , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated .  



    5.5 Potential Risk of Bleeding with Concomitant Use of Warfarin



  ORBACTIV has been shown to artificially prolong prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR) for up to 12 hours, making the monitoring of the anticoagulation effect of warfarin unreliable up to 12 hours after an ORBACTIV dose [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1  )]  .



 Patients should be monitored for bleeding if concomitantly receiving ORBACTIV and warfarin [see  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ]  .



    5.6 Osteomyelitis



  In Phase 3 ABSSSI clinical trials, more cases of osteomyelitis were reported in the ORBACTIV treated arm than in the vancomycin-treated arm. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of osteomyelitis. If osteomyelitis is suspected or diagnosed, institute appropriate alternate antibacterial therapy [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .



    5.7 Development of Drug Resistant Bacteria



  Prescribing ORBACTIV in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria [see  Patient Counseling Information (17)  ]  .
