   EXCERPT:    *  Most common adverse reactions with the 3-day oral aprepitant regimen in conjunction with MEC (&gt;= 1% and greater than standard therapy) were: fatigue and eructation. (  6.1  ) 
 *  Most common adverse reactions with the single-dose fosaprepitant regimen in conjunction with HEC were generally similar to that seen in prior HEC studies with oral aprepitant. In addition, infusion site reactions (3%) occurred. (  6.1  ) 
 *  Most common adverse reactions with single-dose CINVANTI (&gt;2%) were: headache and fatigue. (  6.1  )

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 The safety of CINVANTI was evaluated as a single-dose in healthy subjects and established from adequate and well-controlled studies of intravenous fosaprepitant and/or oral aprepitant  [see Clinical Studies (  14  )].  Adverse reactions observed in these adequate and well-controlled studies are described below.



   Safety of CINVANTI  



 A total of 200 healthy subjects received a single 130 mg dose of CINVANTI as a 30-minute infusion. Adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of subjects were headache (3%) and fatigue (2%).



   Single-Dose Intravenous Fosaprepitant -- HEC  



 In an active-controlled clinical study in patients receiving HEC, safety was evaluated for 1143 patients receiving a single intravenous dose of fosaprepitant, a prodrug of aprepitant, compared to 1169 patients receiving a 3-day regimen of oral aprepitant  [see Clinical Studies (  14.1  )].  When administered intravenously, fosaprepitant is converted to aprepitant within 30 minutes. The safety profile was generally similar to that seen in prior HEC studies with a 3-day regimen of oral aprepitant. However, infusion-site reactions occurred at a higher incidence in patients in the intravenous fosaprepitant group (3%) compared to those in the oral aprepitant group (0.5%). The reported infusion-site reactions included: infusion-site erythema, infusion-site pruritus, infusion-site pain, infusion-site induration and infusion-site thrombophlebitis.



 Adverse reactions associated with oral aprepitant may also be expected to occur with CINVANTI. See the full prescribing information for oral aprepitant for complete safety information.



   3-Day Oral Aprepitant -- MEC  



 In 2 active-controlled clinical trials in patients receiving MEC, 868 patients were treated with a 3-day oral aprepitant regimen during Cycle 1 of chemotherapy and 686 of these patients continued into extensions for up to 4 cycles of chemotherapy. In both studies, oral aprepitant was given in combination with ondansetron and dexamethasone (oral aprepitant regimen) and was compared to ondansetron and dexamethasone alone (standard therapy)  [see Clinical Studies (  14.2  )].  



 In the combined analysis of Cycle 1 data for these 2 studies, adverse reactions were reported in approximately 14% of patients treated with the aprepitant regimen compared with approximately 15% of patients treated with standard therapy. Treatment was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 0.7% of patients treated with the aprepitant regimen compared with 0.2% of patients treated with standard therapy.



 The most common adverse reactions reported in patients treated with the oral aprepitant regimen with an incidence of at least 1% and greater than standard therapy are listed in  Table 4  .

 The adverse experience profiles in the Multiple-Cycle extensions of HEC and MEC studies for up to 6 cycles of chemotherapy were similar to that observed in Cycle 1.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of intravenous fosaprepitant and/or oral aprepitant. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders  : pruritus, rash, urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )].  



   Immune system disorders  : hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock  [see Contraindications (  4  ), Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )].  



   Nervous system disorders  : ifosfamide-induced neurotoxicity reported after aprepitant and ifosfamide coadministration.
</Section>
    <Section id="S2" name="warnings and precautions">    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *   CYP3A4 Interactions : Aprepitant is a substrate, weak-to-moderate (dose-dependent) inhibitor and an inducer of CYP3A4; see Full Prescribing Information for recommendations regarding contraindications, risk of adverse reactions, and dosage adjustment of CINVANTI and concomitant drugs. (  4  ,  5.1  ,  7.1  ,  7.2  ) 
 *   Hypersensitivity Reactions (including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock) : Reported during or soon after infusion with fosaprepitant, a prodrug of aprepitant, and with oral aprepitant. If symptoms occur, discontinue CINVANTI. Do not reinitiate if symptoms occur with first time use. (  4  ,  5.2  ) 
 *   Warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate) : Risk of decreased INR of prothrombin time; monitor INR in 2-week period, particularly at 7 to 10 days, following initiation of CINVANTI. (  5.3  ,  7.1  ) 
 *   Hormonal Contraceptives : Efficacy of contraceptives may be reduced during and for 28 days following administration of aprepitant. Use effective alternative or back-up methods of non-hormonal contraception. (  5.4  ,  7.1  ,  8.3  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Clinically Significant CYP3A4 Drug Interactions



  Aprepitant is a substrate, weak-to-moderate (dose-dependent) inhibitor, and an inducer of CYP3A4.



 *  *  Use of pimozide with CINVANTI is contraindicated due to the risk of significantly increased plasma concentrations of pimozide, potentially resulting in prolongation of the QT interval, a known adverse reaction of pimozide [see Contraindications (  4  )].  
   Use of CINVANTI with other drugs that are CYP3A4 substrates may result in increased plasma concentration of the concomitant drug. 
 *  Use of CINVANTI with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, diltiazem) may increase plasma concentrations of aprepitant and result in an increased risk of adverse reactions related to CINVANTI. 
 *  Use of CINVANTI with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may result in a reduction in aprepitant plasma concentrations and decreased efficacy of CINVANTI. 
    See  Table 6  and  Table 7  for a listing of potentially significant drug interactions [see Drug Interactions (  7.1  ,  7.2  )].  
 

    5.2 Hypersensitivity Reactions



  Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock, have occurred during or soon after infusion of fosaprepitant, a prodrug of aprepitant, and with oral aprepitant. Symptoms including flushing, erythema, dyspnea, hypotension and syncope have been reported [see Adverse Reactions (  6.2  )].  



 Monitor patients during and after infusion. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue the infusion and administer appropriate medical therapy. Do not reinitiate CINVANTI in patients who experience these symptoms during first-time use.



    5.3 Decrease in INR with Concomitant Warfarin



  Coadministration of CINVANTI with warfarin, a CYP2C9 substrate, may result in a clinically significant decrease in the International Normalized Ratio (INR) of prothrombin time [see Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )].  Monitor the INR in patients on chronic warfarin therapy in the 2-week period, particularly at 7 to 10 days, following initiation of CINVANTI with each chemotherapy cycle [see Drug Interactions (  7.1  )].  



    5.4 Risk of Reduced Efficacy of Hormonal Contraceptives



  Upon coadministration with CINVANTI, the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be reduced during administration of and for 28 days following the last dose of CINVANTI [see Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )].  Advise patients to use effective alternative or back-up methods of non-hormonal contraception during treatment with CINVANTI and for 1 month following administration of CINVANTI or oral aprepitant, whichever is administered last [see Drug Interactions (  7.1  ), Use in Specific Populations (  8.3  )].
