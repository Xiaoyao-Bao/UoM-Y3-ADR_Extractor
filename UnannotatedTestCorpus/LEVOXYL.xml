  Adverse reactions associated with levothyroxine therapy are primarily those of hyperthyroidism due to therapeutic overdosage. They include the following:

   General:  fatigue, increased appetite, weight loss, heat intolerance, fever, excessive sweating;

   Central nervous system:  headache, hyperactivity, nervousness, anxiety, irritability, emotional lability, insomnia;

   Musculoskeletal:  tremors, muscle weakness;

   Cardiac:  palpitations, tachycardia, arrhythmias, increased pulse and blood pressure, heart failure, angina, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest;

   Pulmonary:  dyspnea;

   GI:  diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramps;

   Dermatologic:  hair loss, flushing;

   Reproductive:  menstrual irregularities, impaired fertility.

 Pseudotumor cerebri and slipped capital femoral epiphysis have been reported in children receiving levothyroxine therapy. Overtreatment may result in craniosynostosis in infants and premature closure of the epiphyses in children with resultant compromised adult height.

 Seizures have been reported rarely with the institution of levothyroxine therapy.

 Inadequate levothyroxine dosage will produce or fail to ameliorate the signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism.

 Hypersensitivity reactions to inactive ingredients have occurred in patients treated with thyroid hormone products. These include urticaria, pruritus, skin rash, flushing, angioedema, various GI symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea), fever, arthralgia, serum sickness and wheezing. Hypersensitivity to levothyroxine itself is not known to occur.

 In addition to the above events, the following have been reported, predominately when Levoxyl tablets were not taken with water: choking, gagging, tablet stuck in throat and dysphagia (see    Information for Patients    ).

    <Section id="S2" name="precautions">   PRECAUTIONS

   General

  Levothyroxine has a narrow therapeutic index. Regardless of the indication for use, careful dosage titration is necessary to avoid the consequences of over- or under-treatment. These consequences include, among others, effects on growth and development, cardiovascular function, bone metabolism, reproductive function, cognitive function, emotional state, gastrointestinal function, and on glucose and lipid metabolism. Many drugs interact with levothyroxine sodium necessitating adjustments in dosing to maintain therapeutic response (see   Drug Interactions    ).

    Effects on bone mineral density

  In women, long-term levothyroxine sodium therapy has been associated with decreased bone mineral density, especially in postmenopausal women on greater than replacement doses or in women who are receiving suppressive doses of levothyroxine sodium. Therefore, it is recommended that patients receiving levothyroxine sodium be given the minimum dose necessary to achieve the desired clinical and biochemical response.

    Patients with underlying cardiovascular disease

  Exercise caution when administering levothyroxine to patients with cardiovascular disorders and to the elderly in whom there is an increased risk of occult cardiac disease. In these patients, levothyroxine therapy should be initiated at lower doses than those recommended in younger individuals or in patients without cardiac disease (see   WARNINGS  ;  PRECAUTIONS , Geriatric Use  ;  and   DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION    ). If cardiac symptoms develop or worsen, the levothyroxine dose should be reduced or withheld for one week and then cautiously restarted at a lower dose. Overtreatment with levothyroxine sodium may have adverse cardiovascular effects such as an increase in heart rate, cardiac wall thickness, and cardiac contractility and may precipitate angina or arrhythmias. Patients with coronary artery disease who are receiving levothyroxine therapy should be monitored closely during surgical procedures, since the possibility of precipitating cardiac arrhythmias may be greater in those treated with levothyroxine. Concomitant administration of levothyroxine and sympathomimetic agents to patients with coronary artery disease may precipitate coronary insufficiency.

    Patients with nontoxic diffuse goiter or nodular thyroid disease

  Exercise caution when administering levothyroxine to patients with nontoxic diffuse goiter or nodular thyroid disease in order to prevent precipitation of thyrotoxicosis (see   WARNINGS    ). If the serum TSH is already suppressed, levothyroxine sodium should not be administered (see   CONTRAINDICATIONS    ).

    Associated endocrine disorders

   Hypothalamic/pituitary hormone deficiencies

  In patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism, additional hypothalamic/pituitary hormone deficiencies should be considered, and, if diagnosed, treated (see   PRECAUTIONS ,Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome    ) for adrenal insufficiency.

    Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome

  Occasionally, chronic autoimmune thyroiditis may occur in association with other autoimmune disorders such as adrenal insufficiency, pernicious anemia, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Patients with concomitant adrenal insufficiency should be treated with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiation of treatment with levothyroxine sodium. Failure to do so may precipitate an acute adrenal crisis when thyroid hormone therapy is initiated, due to increased metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids by thyroid hormone. Patients with diabetes mellitus may require upward adjustments of their antidiabetic therapeutic regimens when treated with levothyroxine (see   PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions    ).

    Other associated medical conditions

  Infants with congenital hypothyroidism appear to be at increased risk for other congenital anomalies, with cardiovascular anomalies (pulmonary stenosis, atrial septal defect, and ventricular septal defect,) being the most common association.

    Information for Patients

  Patients should be informed of the following information to aid in the safe and effective use of LEVOXYL:

 *  Notify your physician if you are allergic to any foods or medicines, are pregnant or intend to become pregnant, are breast-feeding or are taking any other medications, including prescription and over-the-counter preparations. 
 *  Notify your physician of any other medical conditions you may have, particularly heart disease, diabetes, clotting disorders, and adrenal or pituitary gland problems. Your dose of medications used to control these other conditions may need to be adjusted while you are taking LEVOXYL. If you have diabetes, monitor your blood and/or urinary glucose levels as directed by your physician and immediately report any changes to your physician. If you are taking anticoagulants (blood thinners), your clotting status should be checked frequently. 
 *  Use LEVOXYL only as prescribed by your physician. Do not discontinue or change the amount you take or how often you take it, unless directed to do so by your physician. 
 *  The levothyroxine in LEVOXYL is intended to replace a hormone that is normally produced by your thyroid gland. Generally, replacement therapy is to be taken for life, except in cases of transient hypothyroidism, which is usually associated with an inflammation of the thyroid gland (thyroiditis). 
 *  Take LEVOXYL in the morning on an empty stomach, at least one-half hour before eating any food. 
 *  LEVOXYL may rapidly swell and disintegrate resulting in choking, gagging, the tablet getting stuck in your throat or difficulty swallowing. It is very important that you take the tablet with a full glass of water. Most of these problems disappeared when Levoxyl tablets were taken with water. 
 *  It may take several weeks before you notice an improvement in your symptoms. 
 *  Notify your physician if you experience any of the following symptoms: rapid or irregular heartbeat, chest pain, shortness of breath, leg cramps, headache, nervousness, irritability, sleeplessness, tremors, change in appetite, weight gain or loss, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sweating, heat intolerance, fever, changes in menstrual periods, hives or skin rash, or any other unusual medical event. 
 *  Notify your physician if you become pregnant while taking LEVOXYL. It is likely that your dose of LEVOXYL will need to be increased while you are pregnant. 
 *  Notify your physician or dentist that you are taking LEVOXYL prior to any surgery. 
 *  Partial hair loss may occur rarely during the first few months of LEVOXYL therapy, but this is usually temporary. 
 *  LEVOXYL should not be used as a primary or adjunctive therapy in a weight control program. 
 *  Keep LEVOXYL out of the reach of children. Store LEVOXYL away from heat, moisture, and light. 
       Laboratory Tests
 

   General

  The diagnosis of hypothyroidism is confirmed by measuring TSH levels using a sensitive assay (second generation assay sensitivity &lt;=0.1 mIU/L or third generation assay sensitivity &lt;=0.01 mIU/L) and measurement of free-T4.

 The adequacy of therapy is determined by periodic assessment of appropriate laboratory tests and clinical evaluation. The choice of laboratory tests depends on various factors including the etiology of the underlying thyroid disease, the presence of concomitant medical conditions, including pregnancy, and the use of concomitant medications (see   PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions    and   Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions    ). Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of LEVOXYL may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or decreased T4potency of the drug product.

    Adults

  In adult patients with primary (thyroidal) hypothyroidism, serum TSH levels (using a sensitive assay) alone may be used to monitor therapy. The frequency of TSH monitoring during levothyroxine dose titration depends on the clinical situation but it is generally recommended at 6-8 week intervals until normalization. For patients who have recently initiated levothyroxine therapy and whose serum TSH has normalized or in patients who have had their dosage or brand of levothyroxine changed, the serum TSH concentration should be measured after 8-12 weeks. When the optimum replacement dose has been attained, clinical (physical examination) and biochemical monitoring may be performed every 6-12 months, depending on the clinical situation, and whenever there is a change in the patient's status. It is recommended that a physical examination and a serum TSH measurement be performed at least annually in patients receiving LEVOXYL (see   WARNINGS  ,  PRECAUTIONS    , and   DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION    ).

    Pediatrics

  In patients with congenital hypothyroidism, the adequacy of replacement therapy should be assessed by measuring both serum TSH (using a sensitive assay) and total- or free- T4. During the first three years of life, the serum total- or free- T4should be maintained at all times in the upper half of the normal range. While the aim of therapy is to also normalize the serum TSH level, this is not always possible in a small percentage of patients, particularly in the first few months of therapy. TSH may not normalize due to a resetting of the pituitary-thyroid feedback threshold as a result of in utero  hypothyroidism. Failure of the serum T4to increase into the upper half of the normal range within 2 weeks of initiation of LEVOXYL therapy and/or of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 mU/L within 4 weeks should alert the physician to the possibility that the child is not receiving adequate therapy. Careful inquiry should then be made regarding compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to raising the dose of LEVOXYL.

 The recommended frequency of monitoring of TSH and total or free T4in children is as follows: at 2 and 4 weeks after the initiation of treatment; every 1-2 months during the first year of life; every 2-3 months between 1 and 3 years of age; and every 3 to 12 months thereafter until growth is completed. More frequent intervals of monitoring may be necessary if poor compliance is suspected or abnormal values are obtained. It is recommended that TSH and T4levels, and a physical examination, if indicated, be performed 2 weeks after any change in LEVOXYL dosage. Routine clinical examination, including assessment of mental and physical growth and development, and bone maturation, should be performed at regular intervals (see   PRECAUTIONS , Pediatric Use    and   DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION    ).

    Secondary (pituitary) and tertiary (hypothalamic) hypothyroidism

  Adequacy of therapy should be assessed by measuring serum free-T4levels ,which should be maintained in the upper half of the normal range in these patients.

    Drug Interactions

  Many drugs affect thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics and metabolism (e.g., absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to LEVOXYL. In addition, thyroid hormones and thyroid status have varied effects on the pharmacokinetics and action of other drugs. A listing of drug-thyroidal axis interactions is contained in Table 2.

 The list of drug-thyroidal axis interactions in Table 2 may not be comprehensive due to the introduction of new drugs that interact with the thyroidal axis or the discovery of previously unknown interactions. The prescriber should be aware of this fact and should consult appropriate reference sources. (e.g., package inserts of newly approved drugs, medical literature) for additional information if a drug-drug interaction with levothyroxine is suspected.

 Table 2: Drug - Thyroidal Axis Interactions 
 Drug or Drug Class                        Effect                                                         
  
  Drugs that may reduce TSH secretion -the reduction is not sustained; therefore, hypothyroidism does not occur     
 Dopamine / DopamineAgonists GlucocorticoidsOctreotide  Use of these agents may result in a transient reduction in TSH secretion when administered at the following doses: Dopamine (&gt;=1 mcg/kg/min); Glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone &gt;=100 mg/day or equivalent); Octreotide (&gt;100 mcg/day).   
  Drugs that alter thyroid hormone secretion     
  Drugs that may decrease thyroid hormone secretion, which may result in hypothyroidism     
 AminoglutethimideAmiodaroneIodide (including iodine-containing Radiographic contrast agents)LithiumMethimazolePropylthiouracil (PTU)SulfonamidesTolbutamide  Long-term lithium therapy can result in goiter in up to 50% of patients, and either subclinical or overt hypothyroidism, each in up to 20% of patients. The fetus, neonate, elderly and euthyroid patients with underlying thyroid disease (e.g., Hashimoto's thyroiditis or with Grave's disease previously treated with radioiodine or surgery) are among those individuals who are particularly susceptible to iodine-induced hypothyroidism. Oral cholecystographic agents and amiodarone are slowly excreted, producing more prolonged hypothyroidism than parenterally administered iodinated contrast agents. Long-term aminoglutethimide therapy may minimally decrease T4and T3levels and increase TSH, although all values remain within normal limits in most patients.   
  Drugs that may increase thyroid hormone secretion, which may result in hyperthyroidism     
 AmiodaroneIodide (including iodine-containing Radiographic contrast agents)  Iodide and drugs that contain pharmacologic amounts of iodide may cause hyperthyroidism in euthyroid patients with Grave's disease previously treated with antithyroid drugs or in euthyroid patients with thyroid autonomy (e.g., multinodular goiter or hyperfunctioning thyroid adenoma). Hyperthyroidism may develop over several weeks and may persist for several months after therapy discontinuation. Amiodarone may induce hyperthyroidism by causing thyroiditis.   
  Drugs that may decrease T4absorption, which may result in hypothyroidism     
 Antacids- Aluminum &amp; Magnesium Hydroxides- SimethiconeBile Acid Sequestrants- Cholestyramine- ColestipolCalcium CarbonateCation Exchange Resins- KayexalateFerrous SulfateOrlistatSucralfate  Concurrent use may reduce the efficacy of levothyroxine by binding and delaying or preventing absorption, potentially resulting in hypothyroidism. Calcium carbonate may form an insoluble chelate with levothyroxine, and ferrous sulfate likely forms a ferric-thyroxine complex. Administer levothyroxine at least 4 hours apart from these agents. Patients treated concomitantly with orlistat and levothyroxine should be monitored for changes in thyroid function.   
  Drugs that may alter T4and T3serum transport - but FT4concentration remains normal; and, therefore, the patient remains euthyroid     
  Drugs that may increase serum TBG concentration     Drugs that may decrease serum TBG concentration               
 ClofibrateEstrogen-containing oral contraceptivesEstrogens (oral)Heroin / Methadone5-FluorouracilMitotaneTamoxifen  Androgens / Anabolic SteroidsAsparaginaseGlucocorticoidsSlow-Release Nicotinic Acid   
  Drugs that may cause protein-binding site displacement     
 Furosemide ( &gt; 80 mg IV)HeparinHydantoinsNon Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs- Fenamates- PhenylbutazoneSalicylates ( &gt; 2 g/day)  Administration of these agents with levothyroxine results in an initial transient increase in FT4. Continued administration results in a decrease in serum T4and normal FT4and TSH concentrations and, therefore, patients are clinically euthyroid. Salicylates inhibit binding of T4and T3to TBG and transthyretin. An initial increase in serum FT4is followed by return of FT4to normal levels with sustained therapeutic serum salicylate concentrations, although total-T4levels may decrease by as much as 30%.   
  Drugs that may alter T4and T3metabolism     
  Drugs that may increase hepatic metabolism, which may result in hypothyroidism     
 CarbamazepineHydantoinsPhenobarbitalRifampin  Stimulation of hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing enzyme activity may cause increased hepatic degradation of levothyroxine, resulting in increased levothyroxine requirements. Phenytoin and carbamazepine reduce serum protein binding of levothyroxine, and total- and free-T4may be reduced by 20% to 40%, but most patients have normal serum TSH levels and are clinically euthyroid.   
  Drugs that may decrease T45'-deiodinase activity     
 AmiodaroneBeta-adrenergic antagonists- (e.g., Propranolol &gt; 160 mg/day)Glucocorticoids- (e.g., Dexamethasone &gt; 4 mg/day)Propylthiouracil (PTU)  Administration of these enzyme inhibitors decreases the peripheral conversion of T4to T3, leading to decreased T3levels. However, serum T4levels are usually normal but may occasionally be slightly increased. In patients treated with large doses of propranolol (&gt;160 mg/day), T3and T4levels change slightly, TSH levels remain normal, and patients are clinically euthyroid. It should be noted that actions of particular beta-adrenergic antagonists may be impaired when the hypothyroid patient is converted to the euthyroid state. Short-term administration of large doses of glucocorticoids may decrease serum T3concentrations by 30% with minimal change in serum T4levels. However, long-term glucocorticoid therapy may result in slightly decreased T3and T4levels due to decreased TBG production (see above).   
  Miscellaneous                             
 Anticoagulants (oral)- Coumarin Derivatives- Indandione Derivatives  Thyroid hormones appear to increase the catabolism of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, thereby increasing the anticoagulant activity of oral anticoagulants. Concomitant use of these agents impairs the compensatory increases in clotting factor synthesis. Prothrombin time should be carefully monitored in patients taking levothyroxine and oral anticoagulants and the dose of anticoagulant therapy adjusted accordingly.   
 Antidepressants- Tricyclics (e.g., Amitriptyline)- Tetracyclics (e.g., Maprotiline)- Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs; e.g., Sertraline)  Concurrent use of tri/tetracyclic antidepressants and levothyroxine may increase the therapeutic and toxic effects of both drugs, possibly due to increased receptor sensitivity to catecholamines. Toxic effects may include increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and CNS stimulation; onset of action of tricyclics may be accelerated. Administration of sertraline in patients stabilized on levothyroxine may result in increased levothyroxine requirements.   
 Antidiabetic Agents- Biguanides- Meglitinides- Sulfonylureas- Thiazolidediones- Insulin  Addition of levothyroxine to antidiabetic or insulin therapy may result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Careful monitoring of diabetic control is recommended, especially when thyroid therapy is started, changed, or discontinued.   
 Cardiac Glycosides                        Serum digitalis glycoside levels may be reduced in hyperthyroidism or when the hypothyroid patient is converted to the euthyroid state. Therapeutic effect of digitalis glycosides may be reduced.   
 Cytokines- Interferon-alpha- Interleukin-2  Therapy with interferon-alpha has been associated with the development of antithyroid microsomal antibodies in 20% of patients and some have transient hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, or both. Patients who have antithyroid antibodies before treatment are at higher risk for thyroid dysfunction during treatment. Interleukin-2 has been associated with transient painless thyroiditis in 20% of patients. Interferon-beta and -gamma have not been reported to cause thyroid dysfunction.   
 Growth Hormones- Somatrem- Somatropin     Excessive use of thyroid hormones with growth hormones may accelerate epiphyseal closure. However, untreated hypothyroidism may interfere with growth response to growth hormone.   
 Ketamine                                  Concurrent use may produce marked hypertension and tachycardia; cautious administration to patients receiving thyroid hormone therapy is recommended.   
 Methylxanthine Bronchodilators- (e.g., Theophylline)  Decreased theophylline clearance may occur in hypothyroid patients; clearance returns to normal when the euthyroid state is achieved.   
 Radiographic Agents                       Thyroid hormones may reduce the uptake of  123  I,  131  I, and  99m  Tc.   
 Sympathomimetics                          Concurrent use may increase the effects of sympathomimetics or thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormones may increase the risk of coronary insufficiency when sympathomimetic agents are administered to patients with coronary artery disease.   
 Chloral HydrateDiazepamEthionamideLovastatinMetoclopramide6-MercaptopurineNitroprussidePara-aminosalicylate sodiumPerphenazineResorcinol (excessive topical use)Thiazide Diuretics  These agents have been associated with thyroid hormone and / or TSH level alterations by various mechanisms.   
           Oral anticoagulants
 

  Levothyroxine increases the response to oral anticoagulant therapy. Therefore, a decrease in the dose of anticoagulant may be warranted with correction of the hypothyroid state or when the LEVOXYL dose is increased. Prothrombin time should be closely monitored to permit appropriate and timely dosage adjustments (see   Table 2    ).

    Digitalis glycosides

  The therapeutic effects of digitalis glycosides may be reduced by levothyroxine. Serum digitalis glycoside levels may be decreased when a hypothyroid patient becomes euthyroid, necessitating an increase in the dose of digitalis glycosides (see   Table 2    ).

    Drug-Food Interactions

  Consumption of certain foods may affect levothyroxine absorption thereby necessitating adjustments in dosing. Soybean flour (infant formula), cotton seed meal, walnuts, and dietary fiber may bind and decrease the absorption of levothyroxine sodium from the GI tract.

    Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions

  Changes in TBG concentration must be considered when interpreting T4and T3values, which necessitates measurement and evaluation of unbound (free) hormone and/or determination of the free T4index (FT4I). Pregnancy, infectious hepatitis, estrogens, estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, and acute intermittent porphyria increase TBG concentrations. Decreases in TBG concentrations are observed in nephrosis, severe hypoproteinemia, severe liver disease, acromegaly, and after androgen or corticosteroid therapy (see also   Table 2    ). Familial hyper- or hypo-thyroxine binding globulinemias have been described, with the incidence of TBG deficiency approximating 1 in 9000.

    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility

  Animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential or effects on fertility of levothyroxine. The synthetic T4in LEVOXYL is identical to that produced naturally by the human thyroid gland. Although there has been a reported association between prolonged thyroid hormone therapy and breast cancer, this has not been confirmed. Patients receiving LEVOXYL for appropriate clinical indications should be titrated to the lowest effective replacement dose.

    Pregnancy

   Category A

  Studies in women taking levothyroxine sodium during pregnancy have not shown an increased risk of congenital abnormalities. Therefore, the possibility of fetal harm appears remote. LEVOXYL should not be discontinued during pregnancy and hypothyroidism diagnosed during pregnancy should be promptly treated.

 Hypothyroidism during pregnancy is associated with a higher rate of complications, including spontaneous abortion, pre-eclampsia, stillbirth and premature delivery. Maternal hypothyroidism may have an adverse effect on fetal and childhood growth and development. During pregnancy, serum T4levels may decrease and serum TSH levels increase to values outside the normal range. Since elevations in serum TSH may occur as early as 4 weeks gestation, pregnant women taking LEVOXYL should have their TSH measured during each trimester. An elevated serum TSH level should be corrected by an increase in the dose of LEVOXYL. Since postpartum TSH levels are similar to preconception values, the LEVOXYL dosage should return to the pre-pregnancy dose immediately after delivery. A serum TSH level should be obtained 6-8 weeks postpartum.

 Thyroid hormones do not readily cross the placental barrier; however, some transfer does occur as evidenced by levels in cord blood of athyreotic fetuses being approximately one-third maternal levels. Transfer of thyroid hormone from the mother to the fetus, however, may not be adequate to prevent in utero hypothyroidism.

    Nursing Mothers

  Although thyroid hormones are excreted only minimally in human milk, caution should be exercised when LEVOXYL is administered to a nursing woman. However, adequate replacement doses of levothyroxine are generally needed to maintain normal lactation.

    Pediatric Use

   General

  The goal of treatment in pediatric patients with hypothyroidism is to achieve and maintain normal intellectual and physical growth and development.

 The initial dose of levothyroxine varies with age and body weight (see   DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , Table 3    ). Dosing adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual patient's clinical and laboratory parameters (see   PRECAUTIONS , Laboratory Tests    ).

 In children in whom a diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been established, it is recommended that levothyroxine administration be discontinued for a 30-day trial period, but only after the child is at least 3 years of age. Serum T4and TSH levels should then be obtained. If the T4is low and the TSH high, the diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism is established, and levothyroxine therapy should be reinstituted. If the T4and TSH levels are normal, euthyroidism may be assumed and, therefore, the hypothyroidism can be considered to have been transient. In this instance, however, the physician should carefully monitor the child and repeat the thyroid function tests if any signs or symptoms of hypothyroidism develop. In this setting, the clinician should have a high index of suspicion of relapse. If the results of the levothyroxine withdrawal test are inconclusive, careful follow-up and subsequent testing will be necessary.

 Since some more severely affected children may become clinically hypothyroid when treatment is discontinued for 30 days, an alternate approach is to reduce the replacement dose of levothyroxine by half during the 30-day trial period. If, after 30 days, the serum TSH is elevated above 20 mU/L, the diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism is confirmed, and full replacement therapy should be resumed. However, if the serum TSH has not risen to greater than 20mU/L, levothyroxine treatment should be discontinued for another 30-day trial period followed by repeat serum T4and TSH.

 The presence of concomitant medical conditions should be considered in certain clinical circumstances and, if present, appropriately treated (see   PRECAUTIONS    ).

    Congenital Hypothyroidism

  (see   PRECAUTIONS , Laboratory Tests    and   DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION    )

 Rapid restoration of normal serum T4concentrations is essential for preventing the adverse effects of congenital hypothyroidism on intellectual development as well as on overall physical growth and maturation. Therefore, LEVOXYL therapy should be initiated immediately upon diagnosis and is generally continued for life.

 During the first 2 weeks of LEVOXYL therapy, infants should be closely monitored for cardiac overload, arrhythmias, and aspiration from avid suckling.

 The patient should be monitored closely to avoid undertreatment or overtreatment. Undertreatment may have deleterious effects on intellectual development and linear growth. Overtreatment has been associated with craniosynostosis in infants, and may adversely affect the tempo of brain maturation and accelerate the bone age with resultant premature closure of the epiphyses and compromised adult stature.

    Acquired Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients

  The patient should be monitored closely to avoid undertreatment and overtreatment. Undertreatment may result in poor school performance due to impaired concentration and slowed mentation and in reduced adult height. Overtreatment may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature.

 Treated children may manifest a period of catch-up growth, which may be adequate in some cases to normalize adult height. In children with severe or prolonged hypothyroidism, catch-up growth may not be adequate to normalize adult height.

    Geriatric Use

  Because of the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease among the elderly, levothyroxine therapy should not be initiated at the full replacement dose (see   WARNINGS  ,  PRECAUTIONS  ,  and   DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION    ).

</Section>
    <Section id="S3" name="warnings">   WARNINGS

   WARNING

   Thyroid hormones, including LEVOXYL, either alone or with other therapeutic agents, should not be used for the treatment of obesity or for weight loss. In euthyroid patients, doses within the range of daily hormonal requirements are ineffective for weight reduction. Larger doses may produce serious or even life threatening manifestations of toxicity, particularly when given in association with sympathomimetic amines such as those used for their anorectic effects.  

   Levothyroxine sodium should not be used in the treatment of male or female infertility unless this condition is associated with hypothyroidism.

 In patients with nontoxic diffuse goiter or nodular thyroid disease, particularly the elderly or those with underlying cardiovascular disease, levothyroxine sodium therapy is contraindicated if the serum TSH level is already suppressed due to the risk of precipitating overt thyrotoxicosis (see   CONTRAINDICATIONS    ). If the serum TSH level is not suppressed, LEVOXYL should be used with caution in conjunction with careful monitoring of thyroid function for evidence of hyperthyroidism and clinical monitoring for potential associated adverse cardiovascular signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism.
