    <Section id="S2" name="precautions">    PRECAUTIONS:



  Open under aseptic conditions only.



 Studies suggest that intraocular irrigating solutions which are iso-osmotic with normal aqueous fluids should be used with caution in diabetic patients undergoing vitrectomy since intraoperative lens changes have been observed.



 There have been reports of corneal clouding and edema following ocular surgery in which BSS Sterile Irrigating Solution was used as an irrigating solution.
