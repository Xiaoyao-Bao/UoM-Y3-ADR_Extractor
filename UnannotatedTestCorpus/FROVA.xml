  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 FROVA was evaluated in four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, short-term trials. These trials involved 2392 patients (1554 on FROVA 2.5 mg and 838 on placebo). In these short-term trials, patients were predominately female (88%) and Caucasian (94%) with a mean age of 42 years (range 18 to 69).The treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred most frequently following administration of FROVA 2.5 mg (  i.e.,  in at least 2% of patients), and at an incidence &gt;=1% greater than with placebo, were dizziness, paresthesia, headache, dry mouth, fatigue, flushing, hot or cold sensation, dyspepsia, skeletal pain, and chest pain. In a long-term, open-label study where 496 patients were allowed to treat multiple migraine attacks with FROVA 2.5 mg for up to 1 year, 5% of patients (n=26) discontinued due to treatment-emergent adverse events.



 Table 1 lists treatment-emergent adverse events reported within 48 hours of drug administration that occurred with FROVA 2.5 mg at an incidence of &gt;=2% and more often than on placebo, in the four placebo-controlled trials. The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical trials in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these incidence estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ.

         The incidence of adverse events in clinical trials did not increase when up to 3 doses were used within 24 hours. The incidence of adverse events in placebo-controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender, age, or concomitant medications commonly used by migraine patients. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse events.
 

     Other Events Observed in Association with the Administration of FROVA    



 The incidence of frequently reported adverse events in four placebo-controlled trials is presented below. Events are further classified within body system categories. Frequent adverse events are those occurring in at least 1/100 patients.



   Central and peripheral nervous system:  dysesthesia and hypoesthesia.



   Gastrointestinal:  vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea.



   Body as a whole:  pain.



   Psychiatric:  insomnia and anxiety.



   Respiratory:  sinusitis and rhinitis.



   Vision disorders    :  vision abnormal.



   Skin and appendages:  sweating increased.



   Hearing and vestibular disorders:  tinnitus.



   Heart rate and rhythm:  palpitation.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions were identified during post approval use of FROVA. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

   5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction,  and Prinzmetal's Angina



  FROVA is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of FROVA. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. FROVA may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's angina), even in patients without a history of CAD.



 Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving FROVA.  Do not administer FROVA if there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm [ see Contraindications (  4  )  ]. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administrating the first FROVA dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following FROVA administration.  For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of FROVA.



    5.2 Arrhythmias



  Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1agonists.  Discontinue FROVA if these disturbances occur.  FROVA is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders [see Contraindications (  4  )].  



    5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure



  Sensations of pain, tightness, pressure, and heaviness have been reported in the chest, throat, neck, and jaw after treatment with FROVA and are usually non-cardiac in origin.  However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk.  The use of FROVA is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal's angina [ see Contraindications (  4  )  ].



    5.4 Cerebrovascular Events



  Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, and other cerebrovascular events have been reported in patients treated with 5-HT1agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not.



 Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical of migraine, other potentially serious neurological conditions need to be excluded. FROVA is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA [see Contraindications (  4  )].  



    5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions



  FROVA may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud's syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of a vasospastic reaction following the use of any 5-HT1agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before using FROVA [ see Contraindications (  4  )  ].



 Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1agonists have not been clearly established.



    5.6  Medication Overuse Headache



  Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary.



    5.7 Serotonin Syndrome



  Serotonin syndrome may occur with FROVA, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors [ see Drug Interactions (  7.3  )  ]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue FROVA if serotonin syndrome is suspected.



    5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure



  Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT1agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension.  Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with FROVA.  FROVA is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see Contraindications (  4  )].  



    5.9 Hypersensitivity Reactions



  There have been reports of reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema, in patients receiving FROVA. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal.  In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens.  FROVA is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to FROVA [see Contraindications (  4  )].
