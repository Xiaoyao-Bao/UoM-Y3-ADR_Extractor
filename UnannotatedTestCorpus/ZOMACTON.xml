  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed during the clinical trials performed with one somatropin formulation cannot always be directly compared to the rates observed during the clinical trials performed with a different approved somatropin formulation, and may not reflect the adverse reaction rates observed in practice.



     Pediatric Patients  



     Growth Failure due to Inadequate Secretion of Endogenous Growth Hormone  



 ZOMACTON was evaluated in 164 pediatric patients with short stature due to GHD in an open-label study for 24 weeks. The subjects ranged in age from 2.1 to 17.7 years with a mean of 10.8 years. One hundred twenty (73%) of the subjects were male and 44 (27%) were female. Two subjects were Asian, 12 were Black, 130 were Caucasian, and 20 were categorized as 'other'.

        All pediatric patients were carefully observed for signs or laboratory abnormalities of hypothyroidism. Fifteen patients had T4 values which occasionally fell below the central laboratory's lower limit of normal; T4 levels rose to normal when tested during the next visit for all patients except one who continued to be monitored. Six of the 15 patients received thyroxine therapy before and throughout the study period, and thyroxine dose adjustments were made during the study in 3/6 subjects.
 

 In studies with GH deficient pediatric patients, injection site pain was reported in 1.6% of patients. A mild and transient edema, which appeared in 1.6% of patients, was observed early during the course of treatment.



     Short Stature Associated with Turner Syndrome  



 In a randomized, concurrent-controlled, open-label study, there was an increase in the occurrence of otitis media, ear disorders and surgical procedures in patients receiving another somatropin product at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg/week, compared with untreated control patients (Table 2). A similar increase in otitis media was observed in an 18-month placebo-controlled study.

             Idiopathic Short Stature  
 

 Adverse reactions from a randomized, placebo-controlled study of another somatropin product dosed at 0.22 mg/kg/week are presented in Table 3. Mean fasting serum insulin concentration increased 10% in the group treated with another somatropin product at the end of treatment relative to baseline, but remained within the normal reference range.

     Short Stature or Growth Failure in SHOX Deficiency  



 Adverse reactions from a 2-year open-label study with another somatropin product compared to no treatment are presented in Table 4. During the study, the proportion of patients who had at least one IGF-1 concentration greater than 2.0 SD above the age- and gender-appropriate mean was 37.0% for the somatropin-treated group vs. 0% patients for the untreated group. The proportion of patients who had at least one IGFBP-3 concentration greater than 2.0 SD above the age and gender appropriate mean was 59% for the somatropin treated group vs. 29% for the untreated group.

             Small for Gestational Age (SGA) with No Catch-up Growth by 2 Years to 4 Years of Age  
 

 In a 2-year study, 193 pediatric patients were treated with another somatropin product using 2 different treatment regimens: a fixed dose of 0.067 mg/kg/day (FHD group) or an individually adjusted dose regimen (IAD group; starting dose 0.035 mg/kg/day which could be increased as early as Month 3 to 0.067 mg/kg/day based on a validated growth prediction model). Adverse reactions included common childhood infectious diseases, otitis media, headaches, and slipped capital femoral epiphysis (n=1). Six patients (4 in the FHD group and 2 in the IAD group whose dose was increased from 0.035 mg/kg/day to 0.067 mg/kg/day [one at Month 3 and one at Year 1])) had impaired fasting glucose at Year 2. Two of 6 had impaired fasting glucose during the study, and 1 discontinued treatment at month 15 as a consequence. At study completion, 20-25% of patients had serum IGF-1 SDS values &gt; +2.



 The following adverse reactions were reported from an observational study of 340 pediatric patients who received another somatropin product with an average dosage of 0.041 mg/kg/day for an average of 3 years: type 2 diabetes mellitus (n=1), carpal tunnel syndrome (n=1) and exacerbation of preexisting scoliosis (n=1).



     Adult Patients  



     Adult-Onset GH Deficiency  



 In the first 6 months of controlled blinded trials during which patients received either another somatropin product or placebo, patients who received this other somatropin product experienced a statistically significant increase in edema (another somatropin product 17% vs. placebo 4%, p=0.043) and peripheral edema (12% vs. 0%, respectively, p=0.017). Edema, muscle pain, joint pain, and joint disorder were reported early in therapy and tended to be transient or responsive to dosage titration.



 Two of 113 patients developed carpal tunnel syndrome after beginning maintenance therapy without a low dose (0.00625 mg/kg/day) lead-in phase. Symptoms abated in these patients after dosage reduction.



 All adverse reactions with &gt;=5% overall occurrence rate during 12 or 18 months of replacement therapy with another somatropin product are shown in Table 5 (adult-onset patients) and in Table 6 (childhood-onset patients).



 Adult patients treated with another somatropin product who had been diagnosed with GH deficiency in childhood reported adverse reactions less frequently than those with adult-onset GH deficiency.

             Childhood-Onset GH Deficiency  
 

 Two double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were conducted in 67 adult patients who had received previous somatropin treatment during childhood. Patients were randomized to receive either placebo injections or another somatropin product (0.00625 mg/kg/day for the first 4 weeks, then 0.0125 mg/kg/day thereafter) for the first 6 months, followed by open-label use of another somatropin product for the next 12 months for all patients. The patients in these studies reported side effects less frequently than those with adult-onset GH deficiency. During the placebo-controlled phase (first 6 months) of the study, elevations of serum glutamic oxaloacetic transferase were reported significantly more often for somatropin-treated (12.5%) than placebo-treated patients (0.0%, p=0.031). No other events were reported significantly more often for somatropin-treated patients during the placebo-controlled phase.

   6.2 Immunogenicity

  As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to ZOMACTON in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading.



 In a clinical trial with another recombinant growth hormone during the first 6 months of somatropin therapy in 314 naive patients, 1.6% developed specific antibodies to somatropin (binding capacity &gt;=0.02 mg/L). None had antibody concentrations which exceeded 2 mg/L. Throughout 8 years of this same study, two patients (0.6%) had binding capacity &gt;2 mg/L. Neither patient demonstrated a decrease in growth velocity at or near the time of increased antibody production. It has been reported that growth attenuation from pituitary-derived GH may occur when antibody concentrations are &gt;1.5 mg/L.



   6.3 Post-Marketing Experience

  Because the following adverse events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



   Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions  - Serious systemic hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and angioedema



   Neurologic  - Headaches (common in pediatric patients and occasional in adults)



   Skin  - Increase in size or number of cutaneous nevi



   Endocrine  - Gynecomastia.



   Gastrointestinal  - Pancreatitis



   Metabolic  - New-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus



   Neoplasia  - Leukemia has been reported in a small number of GH deficient pediatric patients treated with somatropin, somatrem (methionylated rhGH), and GH of pituitary origin.

   5.1 Increased Mortality in Patients with Acute Critical Illness



  Increased mortality in patients with acute critical illness due to complications following open heart surgery, abdominal surgery or multiple accidental trauma, or those with acute respiratory failure has been reported after treatment with pharmacologic doses of somatropin [see  Contraindications (4)  ]  . Two placebo-controlled clinical trials in non-GH deficient adult patients (n=522) with these conditions in intensive care units revealed a significant increase in mortality (42% vs. 19%) among somatropin-treated patients (doses 5.3 mg/day-8 mg/day) compared to those receiving placebo. The safety of continuing ZOMACTON treatment in patients receiving replacement doses for approved indications who concurrently develop these illnesses has not been established. ZOMACTON is not indicated for the treatment of non-GH deficient adults.



    5.2 Sudden Death in Pediatric Patients with Prader-Willi Syndrome



  There have been reports of sudden death after initiating therapy with somatropin in pediatric patients with Prader-Willi syndrome who had one or more of the following risk factors: severe obesity, history of upper airway obstruction or sleep apnea, or unidentified respiratory infection. Male patients with one or more of these factors may be at greater risk than females. Patients with Prader-Willi syndrome should be evaluated for signs of upper airway obstruction and sleep apnea before initiation of treatment with somatropin. If, during treatment with somatropin, patients show signs of upper airway obstruction (including onset of, or increased, snoring) and/or new onset sleep apnea, treatment should be interrupted. All patients with Prader-Willi syndrome treated with somatropin should also have effective weight control and be monitored for signs of respiratory infection, which should be diagnosed as early as possible and treated aggressively [see  Contraindications (4)  ]  . ZOMACTON is not indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients who have growth failure due to Prader-Willi syndrome.



    5.3 Increased Risk of Neoplasms



   Active Malignancy  



 There is an increased risk of malignancy progression with somatropin treatment in patients with active malignancy [see  Contraindications (4)  ].  Any preexisting malignancy should be inactive and its treatment complete prior to instituting therapy with ZOMACTON. Discontinue ZOMACTON if there is evidence of recurrent activity.



    Risk of Second Neoplasm in Pediatric Patients  



 There is an increased risk of a second neoplasm in pediatric cancer survivors who were treated with radiation to the brain/head and who developed subsequent GH deficiency and were treated with somatropin. Intracranial tumors, in particular meningiomas, were the most common of these second neoplasms. In adults, it is unknown whether there is any relationship between somatropin replacement therapy and CNS tumor recurrence. Monitor all patients receiving ZOMACTON who have a history of GH deficiency secondary to an intracranial neoplasm for progression or recurrence of the tumor.



    New Malignancy During Treatment  



 Because pediatric patients with certain rare genetic causes of short stature have an increased risk of developing malignancies, thoroughly consider the risks and benefits of starting ZOMACTON in these patients. If ZOMACTON is initiated, these patients should be carefully monitored for development of neoplasms.



 Monitor all patients receiving ZOMACTON carefully for increased growth, or potential malignant changes, of preexisting nevi. Advise patients/caregivers to report marked changes in behavior, onset of headaches, vision disturbances and/or changes in skin pigmentation or changes in the appearance of pre-existing nevi.



    5.4 Glucose Intolerance and Diabetes Mellitus



  Treatment with somatropin may decrease insulin sensitivity, particularly at higher doses. New onset type 2 diabetes mellitus has been reported in patients taking somatropin. Previously undiagnosed impaired glucose tolerance and overt diabetes mellitus may be unmasked. Monitor glucose levels periodically in all patients receiving ZOMACTON, especially in those with risk factors for diabetes mellitus, such as obesity, Turner syndrome, or a family history of diabetes mellitus. Patients with preexisting type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance should be monitored closely. The doses of antidiabetic agents may require adjustment when ZOMACTON is initiated.



    5.5 Intracranial Hypertension



  Intracranial hypertension (IH) with papilledema, visual changes, headache, nausea, and/or vomiting has been reported in a small number of patients treated with somatropin. Symptoms usually occurred within the first eight (8) weeks after the initiation of somatropin. In all reported cases, IH-associated signs and symptoms resolved rapidly after cessation of therapy or a reduction of the somatropin dose. Fundoscopic examination should be performed routinely before initiating treatment with ZOMACTON to exclude preexisting papilledema, and periodically thereafter. If papilledema is observed by fundoscopy, treatment should be stopped. If somatropin-induced IH is diagnosed, treatment with ZOMACTON can be restarted at a lower dose after IH-associated signs and symptoms have resolved. Patients with Turner syndrome may be at increased risk for the development of IH.



    5.6 Severe Hypersensitivity



  Serious systemic hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and angioedema have been reported with postmarketing use of somatropin products. Patients and caregivers should be informed that such reactions are possible and that prompt medical attention should be sought if an allergic reaction occurs [see  Contraindications (4)  ]  .



    5.7 Fluid Retention



  Fluid retention during somatropin replacement therapy in adults may frequently occur. Clinical manifestations of fluid retention (e.g. edema, arthralgia, myalgia, nerve compression syndromes including carpal tunnel syndrome/paresthesias) are usually transient and dose dependent.



    5.8 Hypoadrenalism



  Patients receiving somatropin therapy who have or are at risk for pituitary hormone deficiency(s) may be at risk for reduced serum cortisol levels and/or unmasking of central (secondary) hypoadrenalism. In addition, patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses following initiation of ZOMACTON. Monitor patients for reduced serum cortisol levels and/or need for glucocorticoid dose increases in those with known hypoadrenalism [see  Drug Interactions (7)  ]  .



    5.9 Hypothyroidism



  Undiagnosed or untreated hypothyroidism may prevent response to ZOMACTON, in particular, the growth response in pediatric patients. Patients with Turner syndrome have an increased risk of developing autoimmune thyroid disease and primary hypothyroidism. In patients with GH deficiency, central (secondary) hypothyroidism may first become evident or worsen during somatropin treatment. Therefore, patients should have periodic thyroid function tests performed, and thyroid hormone replacement therapy should be initiated or appropriately adjusted when indicated.



    5.10 Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis in Pediatric Patients



  Slipped capital femoral epiphysis may occur more frequently in patients undergoing rapid growth. Evaluate pediatric patients with the onset of a limp or complaints of hip or knee pain.



    5.11 Progression of Preexisting Scoliosis in Pediatric Patients



  Somatropin increases the growth rate and progression of existing scoliosis can occur in patients who experience rapid growth. Somatropin has not been shown to increase the occurrence of scoliosis. Monitor patients with a history of scoliosis for progression of scoliosis.



    5.12 Pancreatitis



  Cases of pancreatitis have been reported in pediatric patients and adults receiving somatropin. The risk may be greater in pediatric patients compared with adults. Published literature indicates that girls who have Turner syndrome may be at greater risk than other pediatric patients receiving somatropin. Pancreatitis should be considered in patients who develop abdominal pain.



    5.13 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants due to Benzyl Alcohol Preserved Solution



  Serious and fatal adverse reactions including "gasping syndrome" can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including the bacteriostatic 0.9% sodium chloride diluent provided with ZOMACTON 5 mg. The "gasping syndrome" is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations.



 When administering ZOMACTON 5 mg to infants, reconstitute with 0.9% sodium chloride injection, not with the diluent provided. Use only one dose per vial and discard the unused portion [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.4)  ].  



    5.14 Lipoatrophy



  When somatropin is administered subcutaneously at the same site over a long period of time, tissue atrophy may result. Rotate injection sites when administering ZOMACTON to reduce this risk [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  .



    5.15 Laboratory Tests



  Serum levels of inorganic phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, parathyroid hormone and IGF-1 may increase after ZOMACTON treatment.
