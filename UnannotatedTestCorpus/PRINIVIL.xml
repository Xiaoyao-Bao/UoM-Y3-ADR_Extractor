  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     Hypertension  



 The following adverse reactions (events 2% greater on PRINIVIL than on placebo) were observed with PRINIVIL vs placebo: headache (5.7% vs 1.9%), dizziness (5.4% vs 1.9%), cough (3.5% vs 1.0%).



     Heart Failure  



 In controlled studies in patients with heart failure, therapy was discontinued in 8.1% of patients treated with PRINIVIL for 12 weeks, compared to 7.7% of patients treated with placebo for 12 weeks.



 The following adverse reactions (events 2% greater on PRINIVIL than on placebo) were observed with PRINIVIL vs placebo: hypotension (4.4% vs 0.6%), chest pain (3.4% vs 1.3%).



 In the ATLAS trial  [see  Clinical Studies (14.2)  ]  in heart failure patients, withdrawals for adverse reactions were similar in the low- and high-dose groups. The following adverse reactions, mostly related to ACE inhibition, were reported more commonly in the high dose group:



 Table 1: Dose-related Adverse Drug Reactions: ATLAS trial 
                                            High Dose(n=1568)                   Low Dose(n=1596)            
  
 Dizziness                                         19%                                 12%                  
 Hypotension                                       11%                                 7%                   
 Creatinine increased                              10%                                 7%                   
 Hyperkalemia                                       6%                                 4%                   
 Syncope                                            7%                                 5%                   
             Acute Myocardial Infarction  
 

 Patients in the GISSI-3 study, treated with PRINIVIL, had a higher incidence of hypotension (9.0% vs 3.7%) and renal dysfunction (2.4% vs 1.1%) compared with patients not taking PRINIVIL.



 Other clinical adverse reactions occurring in 1% or higher of patients with hypertension or heart failure treated with PRINIVIL in controlled clinical trials and do not appear in other sections of labeling are listed below:



   Body as a whole:  Fatigue, asthenia, orthostatic effects.



   Digestive:  Pancreatitis, constipation, flatulence, dry mouth, diarrhea.



   Hematologic:  Rare cases of bone marrow depression, hemolytic anemia, leukopenia/neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.



   Endocrine:  Diabetes mellitus, inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion.



   Metabolic:  Gout



   Skin:  Urticaria, alopecia, photosensitivity, erythema, flushing, diaphoresis, cutaneous pseudolymphoma, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens - Johnson syndrome, and pruritus.



   Special Senses:  Visual loss, diplopia, blurred vision, tinnitus, photophobia, taste disturbances, olfactory disturbances.



   Urogenital:  Impotence



   Miscellaneous  : A symptom complex has been reported which may include a positive ANA, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, arthralgia/arthritis, myalgia, fever, vasculitis, eosinophilia, leukocytosis, paresthesia and vertigo. Rash, photosensitivity or other dermatological manifestations may occur alone or in combination with these symptoms.



     Clinical Laboratory Test Findings  



     Serum Potassium:  In clinical trials hyperkalemia (serum potassium &gt;5.7 mEq/L) occurred in 2.2% and 4.8% of PRINIVIL-treated patients with hypertension and heart failure, respectively  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.5)  ].  



     Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen:  Minor increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, reversible upon discontinuation of therapy, were observed in about 2% of patients with hypertension treated with PRINIVIL alone. Increases were more common in patients receiving concomitant diuretics and in patients with renal artery stenosis  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.4)  ].  Reversible minor increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine were observed in 11.6% of patients with heart failure on concomitant diuretic therapy. Frequently, these abnormalities resolved when the dosage of the diuretic was decreased.



 Patients with acute myocardial infarction in the GISSI-3 trial treated with PRINIVIL had a higher (2.4% versus 1.1% in placebo) incidence of renal dysfunction in-hospital and at 6 weeks (increasing creatinine concentration to over 3 mg/dL or a doubling or more of the baseline serum creatinine concentration).



     Hemoglobin and Hematocrit:  Small decreases in hemoglobin (mean 0.4 mg/dL) and hematocrit (mean 1.3%) occurred frequently in patients treated with PRINIVIL but were rarely of clinical importance in patients without some other cause of anemia. In clinical trials, fewer than 0.1% of patients discontinued therapy for anemia.



     Liver Enzymes  



 Rarely, elevations of liver enzymes and/or serum bilirubin have occurred  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.6)  ]  .



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of lisinopril that are not included in other sections of labeling. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 Other reactions include:



   Metabolism and nutrition disorders  



 Hyponatremia  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.4)  ]  , cases of hypoglycemia in diabetic patients on oral antidiabetic agents or insulin  [see  Drug Interactions (7.2)  ]  



   Nervous system and psychiatric disorders  



 Mood alterations (including depressive symptoms), mental confusion

   5.1 Fetal Toxicity



   Pregnancy Category D  



 Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue PRINIVIL as soon as possible [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ]  .



    5.2 Angioedema and Anaphylactoid Reactions



   Angioedema  



     Head and Neck Angioedema:    



 Angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis and/or larynx, including some fatal reactions, have occurred in patients treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, including PRINIVIL, at any time during treatment. Patients with involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx are likely to experience airway obstruction, especially those with a history of airway surgery. PRINIVIL should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and monitoring should be provided until complete and sustained resolution of signs and symptoms of angioedema has occurred.



 Patients with a history of angioedema unrelated to ACE inhibitor therapy may be at increased risk of angioedema while receiving an ACE inhibitor [see  Contraindications (4)  ]  . ACE inhibitors have been associated with a higher rate of angioedema in Black than in non-Black patients.



 Patients receiving concomitant ACE inhibitor and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor (e.g., temsirolimus, sirolimus, everolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema [see  Drug Interactions (7.7)  ]  .



 Patients receiving concomitant ACE inhibitor and neprilysin inhibitor therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema [see  Contraindications (4)  and  Drug Interactions (7.8)  ]  .



     Intestinal Angioedema:    



 Intestinal angioedema has occurred in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. These patients presented with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vomiting); in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C-1 esterase levels were normal. In some cases, the angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor.



     Anaphylactoid Reactions    



     Anaphylactoid Reactions During Desensitization:    



 Two patients undergoing desensitizing treatment with Hymenoptera venom while receiving ACE inhibitors sustained life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions.



     Anaphylactoid Reactions During Dialysis:    



 Sudden and potentially life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in some patients dialyzed with high-flux membranes and treated concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor. In such patients, dialysis must be stopped immediately, and aggressive therapy for anaphylactoid reactions must be initiated. Symptoms have not been relieved by antihistamines in these situations. In these patients, consideration should be given to using a different type of dialysis membrane or a different class of antihypertensive agent. Anaphylactoid reactions have also been reported in patients undergoing low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate absorption.



    5.3 Impaired Renal Function



  Monitor renal function periodically in patients treated with PRINIVIL. Changes in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe congestive heart failure, post-myocardial infarction or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing acute renal failure on PRINIVIL. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on PRINIVIL [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  and  Drug Interactions (7.4)  ]  .



    5.4 Hypotension



  PRINIVIL can cause symptomatic hypotension, sometimes complicated by oliguria, progressive azotemia, acute renal failure or death. Patients at risk of excessive hypotension include those with the following conditions or characteristics: heart failure with systolic blood pressure below 100 mmHg, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, hyponatremia, high dose diuretic therapy, renal dialysis, or severe volume and/or salt depletion of any etiology.



 In these patients, start PRINIVIL under medical supervision and follow such patients for the first two weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of PRINIVIL and/or diuretic is increased. Avoid use of PRINIVIL in patients who are hemodynamically unstable after acute MI.



 Symptomatic hypotension is also possible in patients with severe aortic stenosis or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.



    Surgery/Anesthesia:  In patients undergoing major surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, PRINIVIL may block angiotensin II formation secondary to compensatory renin release. If hypotension occurs and is considered to be due to this mechanism, it can be corrected by volume expansion.



    5.5 Hyperkalemia



   Monitor serum potassium periodically in patients receiving PRINIVIL. Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, potassium-containing salt substitutes, or other drugs that may increase serum potassium [see  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ]  .  



    5.6 Hepatic Failure



  ACE inhibitors have been associated with a syndrome that starts with cholestatic jaundice or hepatitis and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis and sometimes death. The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood. Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical treatment.
