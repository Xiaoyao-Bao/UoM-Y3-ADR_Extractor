  6.1       Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.  The adverse reaction information from clinical studies does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates.



 Safety data are presented from two clinical trials in which patients received Vectibix:  Study 20020408, an open-label, multinational, randomized, controlled, monotherapy clinical trial (N = 463) evaluating Vectibix with best supportive care (BSC) versus BSC alone in patients with EGFR-expressing mCRC and Study 20050203, a randomized, controlled trial (N = 1183) in patients with mCRC that evaluated Vectibix in combination with FOLFOX chemotherapy versus FOLFOX chemotherapy alone. Safety data for Study 20050203 are limited to 656 patients with wild-type  KRAS  mCRC. The safety profile of Vectibix in patients with wild-type  RAS  mCRC is similar with that seen in patients with wild-type  KRAS  mCRC.



   Vectibix Monotherapy  



 In Study 20020408, the most common adverse reactions (&gt;= 20%) with Vectibix were skin rash with variable presentations, paronychia, fatigue, nausea, and diarrhea.



 The most common (&gt; 5%) serious adverse reactions in the Vectibix arm were general physical health deterioration and intestinal obstruction. The most frequently reported adverse reactions for Vectibix leading to withdrawal were general physical health deterioration (n = 2) and intestinal obstruction (n = 2).



 For Study 20020408, the data described in Table 1 and in other sections below, except where noted, reflect exposure to Vectibix administered to patients with mCRC as a single agent at the recommended dose and schedule (6 mg/kg every 2 weeks).

           Adverse reactions in Study 20020408 that did not meet the threshold criteria for inclusion in Table 1 were conjunctivitis (4.8% vs &lt; 1%), dry mouth (4.8% vs 0%), pyrexia (16.6% vs 13.2%), chills (3.1% vs &lt; 1%), pustular rash (4.4% vs 0%), papular rash (1.7% vs 0%), dehydration (2.6% vs 1.7%), epistaxis (3.9% vs 0%), and pulmonary embolism (1.3% vs 0%).
 

 In Study 20020408, dermatologic toxicities occurred in 90% of patients receiving Vectibix. Skin toxicity was severe (NCI-CTC grade 3 and higher) in 15% of patients. Ocular toxicities occurred in 16% of patients and included, but were not limited to, conjunctivitis (5%). One patient experienced an NCI-CTC grade 3 event of mucosal inflammation. The incidence of paronychia was 25% and was severe in 2% of patients  [see Warnings and Precautions (      5.1      )].  



 In Study 20020408 (N = 229), median time to the development of dermatologic, nail, or ocular toxicity was 12 days after the first dose of Vectibix; the median time to most severe skin/ocular toxicity was 15 days after the first dose of Vectibix; and the median time to resolution after the last dose of Vectibix was 98 days. Severe toxicity necessitated dose interruption in 11% of Vectibix-treated patients  [see Dosage and Administration (      2.3      )]  .



 Subsequent to the development of severe dermatologic toxicities, infectious complications, including sepsis, septic death, necrotizing fasciitis, and abscesses requiring incisions and drainage were reported.



   Vectibix in Combination    w    ith    FOLFOX    Chemotherapy  



 The most commonly reported adverse reactions (&gt;= 20%) in patients with wild-type  KRAS  mCRC receiving Vectibix (6 mg/kg every 2 weeks) and FOLFOX therapy (N = 322) in Study 20050203 were diarrhea, stomatitis, mucosal inflammation, asthenia, paronychia, anorexia, hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, rash, acneiform dermatitis, pruritus, and dry skin (Table 2). Serious adverse reactions (&gt;= 2% difference between treatment arms) in Vectibix-treated patients with wild-type  KRAS  mCRC were diarrhea and dehydration. The commonly reported adverse reactions (&gt;= 1%) leading to discontinuation in patients with wild-type  KRAS  mCRC receiving Vectibix were rash, paresthesia, fatigue, diarrhea, acneiform dermatitis, and hypersensitivity.  One grade 5 adverse reaction, hypokalemia, occurred in a patient who received Vectibix.

   Infusion Reactions  



 Infusional toxicity manifesting as fever, chills, dyspnea, bronchospasm or hypotension was assessed within 24 hours of an infusion during the clinical study.  Vital signs and temperature were measured within 30 minutes prior to initiation and upon completion of the Vectibix infusion.  The use of premedication was not standardized in the clinical trials.  Thus, the utility of premedication in preventing the first or subsequent episodes of infusional toxicity is unknown.  Across clinical trials of Vectibix monotherapy, 3% (24/725) experienced infusion reactions of which &lt; 1% (3/725) were severe (NCI-CTC grade 3-4).  In one patient, Vectibix was permanently discontinued for a serious infusion reaction  [    see    Dosage and Administration    (      2.2      ,      2.3      )    ]  .



   6.2       Immunogenicity

  As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to panitumumab in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.



 The immunogenicity of Vectibix has been evaluated using two different screening immunoassays for the detection of binding anti-panitumumab antibodies: an acid dissociation bridging enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) detecting high-affinity antibodies and a Biacore  (r)  biosensor immunoassay detecting both high- and low-affinity antibodies. For patients whose sera tested positive in screening immunoassays, an  in vitro  biological assay was performed to detect neutralizing antibodies.



   Monotherapy  :  The incidence of treatment-emergent binding anti-panitumumab antibodies was 0.5% (7/1295) as detected by ELISA and 5.3% (68/1295) as detected by the Biacore  (r)  assay.  The incidence of neutralizing anti-panitumumab antibodies was 0.8% (11/1295). There was no evidence of altered pharmacokinetics or safety profiles in patients who developed antibodies to panitumumab.



   In combination with chemotherapy  : The incidence of treatment-emergent binding anti-panitumumab antibodies was 0.9% (12/1297) as detected by the ELISA and 0.7% (9/1296) as detected by the Biacore  (r)  assay.  The incidence of neutralizing anti-panitumumab antibodies was 0.2% (2/1297). No evidence of an altered safety profile was found in patients who developed antibodies to panitumumab.



   6.3       Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Vectibix.  Because these reactions are reported in a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



 *   Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:   Skin necrosis, angioedema, life-threatening and fatal bullous mucocutaneous disease [see    Boxed Warning    , Dosage and Administration (    2.3    ), and Warnings and Precautions (    5.1    )]

   5.1       Dermatologic and Soft Tissue Toxicity



  In Study 20020408, dermatologic toxicities occurred in 90% of patients and were severe (NCI-CTC grade 3 and higher) in 15% of patients with mCRC receiving Vectibix.  The clinical manifestations included, but were not limited to, acneiform dermatitis, pruritus, erythema, rash, skin exfoliation, paronychia, dry skin, and skin fissures.



 Monitor patients who develop dermatologic or soft tissue toxicities while receiving Vectibix for the development of inflammatory or infectious sequelae. Life-threatening and fatal infectious complications including necrotizing fasciitis, abscesses, and sepsis have been observed in patients treated with Vectibix. Life-threatening and fatal bullous mucocutaneous disease with blisters, erosions, and skin sloughing has also been observed in patients treated with Vectibix. It could not be determined whether these mucocutaneous adverse reactions were directly related to EGFR inhibition or to idiosyncratic immune-related effects (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis).  Withhold or discontinue Vectibix for dermatologic or soft tissue toxicity associated with severe or life-threatening inflammatory or infectious complications  [   see     Boxed Warning         and   Adverse Reactions       (     6.1     ,     6.3     )   ].    Dose modifications for Vectibix concerning dermatologic toxicity are provided     [see   Dosage and Administration   (     2.3     )   ]  .



    5.2       Increased Tumor Progression, Increased Mortality, or Lack of Benefit in Patients with RAS  -Mutant mCRC



  Vectibix is not indicated for the treatment of patients with colorectal cancer that harbor somatic RAS   mutations in exon 2 (codons 12 and 13), exon 3 (codons 59 and 61), and exon 4 (codons 117 and 146) of either KRAS  or NRAS  and hereafter is referred to as " RAS  "  [   see    Indications and Usage (     1.1     ), Dosage and Administration (     2.1     ),   Clinical Pharmacology (     12.1     )   and    Clinical Studies (     14     )   ]  .



 Retrospective subset analyses across several randomized clinical trials were conducted to investigate the role of RAS  mutations on the clinical effects of anti-EGFR-directed monoclonal antibodies (panitumumab or cetuximab). Anti-EGFR antibodies in patients with tumors containing RAS  mutations resulted in exposing those patients to anti-EGFR related adverse reactions without clinical benefit from these agents  [see Indications and Usage (     1.1     ), and Clinical Pharmacology (     12.1     )]  .



 Additionally, in Study 20050203, 272 patients with RAS  -mutant mCRC tumors received Vectibix in combination with FOLFOX and 276 patients received FOLFOX alone.  In an exploratory subgroup analysis ,  OS was shorter (HR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.01-1.45) in patients    with RAS  -mutant mCRC who received Vectibix and FOLFOX versus FOLFOX alone [see Indications and Usage (     1.1     )]  .



    5.3       Electrolyte Depletion/Monitoring



  Progressively decreasing serum magnesium levels leading to severe (grade 3-4) hypomagnesemia occurred in up to 7% (in Study 20080763) of patients across clinical trials. Monitor patients for hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia prior to initiating Vectibix treatment, periodically during Vectibix treatment, and for up to 8 weeks after the completion of treatment.  Other electrolyte disturbances, including hypokalemia, have also been observed. Replete magnesium and other electrolytes as appropriate.



    5.4       Infusion Reactions



  In Study 20020408, 4% of patients experienced infusion reactions and 1% of patients experienced severe infusion reactions (NCI-CTC grade 3-4).



 Infusion reactions, manifesting as fever, chills, dyspnea, bronchospasm, and hypotension, can occur following Vectibix administration [see Adverse Reactions (     6.1     ,     6.3     )]  . Fatal infusion reactions occurred in postmarketing experience. Terminate the infusion for severe infusion reactions [see Dosage and Administration (     2.3     )]  .



    5.5       Acute Renal Failure in Combination with Chemotherapy



  Severe diarrhea and dehydration, leading to acute renal failure and other complications, have been observed in patients treated with Vectibix in combination with chemotherapy.



    5.6       Pulmonary Fibrosis/Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)



  Fatal and nonfatal cases of interstitial lung disease (ILD) (1%) and pulmonary fibrosis have been observed in patients treated with Vectibix. Pulmonary fibrosis occurred in less than 1% (2/1467) of patients enrolled in clinical studies of Vectibix. In the event of acute onset or worsening of pulmonary symptoms, interrupt Vectibix therapy. Discontinue Vectibix therapy if ILD is confirmed.



 In patients with a history of interstitial pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis, or evidence of interstitial pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis, the benefits of therapy with Vectibix versus the risk of pulmonary complications must be carefully considered.



    5.7       Photosensitivity



  Exposure to sunlight can exacerbate dermatologic toxicity.  Advise patients to wear sunscreen and hats and limit sun exposure while receiving Vectibix.



    5.8       Ocular Toxicities



  Keratitis and ulcerative keratitis, known risk factors for corneal perforation, have been reported with Vectibix use. Monitor for evidence of keratitis or ulcerative keratitis. Interrupt or discontinue Vectibix therapy for acute or worsening keratitis.



    5.9       Increased Mortality and Toxicity with Vectibix in Combination with Bevacizumab and Chemotherapy



  In an interim analysis of an open-label, multicenter, randomized clinical trial in the first-line setting in patients with mCRC, the addition of Vectibix to the combination of bevacizumab and chemotherapy resulted in decreased OS and increased incidence of NCI-CTC grade 3-5 (87% vs 72%) adverse reactions. NCI-CTC grade 3-4 adverse reactions occurring at a higher rate in Vectibix-treated patients included rash/acneiform dermatitis (26% vs 1%), diarrhea (23% vs 12%), dehydration (16% vs 5%), primarily occurring in patients with diarrhea, hypokalemia (10% vs 4%), stomatitis/mucositis (4% vs &lt; 1%), and hypomagnesemia (4% vs 0).



 NCI-CTC grade 3-5 pulmonary embolism occurred at a higher rate in Vectibix-treated patients (7% vs 3%) and included fatal events in three (&lt; 1%) Vectibix-treated patients.



 As a result of the toxicities experienced, patients randomized to Vectibix, bevacizumab, and chemotherapy received a lower mean relative dose intensity of each chemotherapeutic agent (oxaliplatin, irinotecan, bolus 5-FU, and/or infusional 5-FU) over the first 24 weeks on study compared with those randomized to bevacizumab and chemotherapy.



    5.10       Embryo-fetal Toxicity



   Based on data from animal studies and its mechanism of action, Vectibix can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.  When given during organogenesis, panitumumab administration resulted in embryolethality in cynomolgus monkeys at exposures approximately 1.25 to 5-times the recommended human dose.  Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus.  Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment, and for at least 2 months after the last dose of Vectibix  [see Use in Specific Populations (     8.1     ,     8.3     ), Clinical Pharmacology (     12.1     )].
