   5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

   EXCERPT:    *  Serious Infections: Do not start SIMPONI during an active infection. If an infection develops, monitor carefully, and stop SIMPONI if infection becomes serious (  5.1  ) 
 *  Invasive Fungal Infections: For patients who develop a systemic illness on SIMPONI, consider empiric antifungal therapy for those who reside in or travel to regions where mycoses are endemic (  5.1  ) 
 *  Hepatitis B Reactivation: Monitor HBV carriers during and several months after therapy. If reactivation occurs, stop SIMPONI and begin antiviral therapy (  5.1  ) 
 *  Malignancies: Incidence of lymphoma was greater than in the general U.S. population. Cases of other malignancies have been observed among patients receiving TNF blockers (  5.2  ) 
 *  Congestive Heart Failure: Worsening, or new onset, may occur. Stop SIMPONI if new or worsening symptoms occur (  5.3  ) 
 *  Demyelinating Disorders: Exacerbation or new onset may occur (  5.4  ) 
 *  Lupus-like Syndrome: Discontinue SIMPONI if symptoms develop (  5.5  ) 
 *  Hypersensitivity Reactions: Serious systemic hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis may occur (  5.11  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Serious Infections

  Patients treated with SIMPONI are at increased risk for developing serious  infections≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  involving various organ systems and sites that may lead to hospitalization or  death≠B-NonOSE_AE .

  Opportunistic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   infections≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   due≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   to≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   bacterial≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, or parasitic  organisms≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  including  aspergillosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  blastomycosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  candidiasis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  coccidioidomycosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  histoplasmosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  legionellosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  listeriosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  pneumocystosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  tuberculosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported with TNF blockers. Patients have frequently presented with disseminated rather than localized disease. The concomitant use of a TNF blocker and abatacept or anakinra was associated with a higher risk of serious  infections≠B-NonOSE_AE ; therefore, the concomitant use of SIMPONI and these biologic products is not recommended [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.6  ,  5.7)  and  Drug Interactions (7.2)  ]  .

 Treatment with SIMPONI should not be initiated in patients with an  active≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   infection≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , including clinically important  localized≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   infections≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Patients greater than 65 years of age, patients with co-morbid conditions and/or patients taking concomitant  immunosuppressants≠B-NonOSE_AE  such as corticosteroids or methotrexate may be at greater risk of  infection≠B-NonOSE_AE . Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating SIMPONI in patients:

 *  with chronic or recurrent  infection≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ; 
 *  who have been  exposed≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   to≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   tuberculosis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ; 
 *  with a history of an  opportunistic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   infection≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ; 
 *  who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic  tuberculosis≠B-NonOSE_AE  or endemic  mycoses≠B-NonOSE_AE , such as  histoplasmosis≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  coccidioidomycosis≠B-NonOSE_AE , or  blastomycosis≠B-NonOSE_AE ; or 
 *  with underlying conditions that may  predispose≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   them≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   to≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   infection≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . 
       Monitoring  
 

 Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of  infection≠B-NonOSE_AE  during and after treatment with SIMPONI. Discontinue SIMPONI if a patient develops a serious  infection≠B-NonOSE_AE , an  opportunistic≠B-NonOSE_AE   infection≠I-NonOSE_AE , or  sepsis≠B-NonOSE_AE . For a patient who develops a new  infection≠B-NonOSE_AE  during treatment with SIMPONI, perform a prompt and complete diagnostic workup appropriate for an  immunocompromised≠B-NonOSE_AE  patient, initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy, and closely monitor them.

    Serious Infection in Clinical Trials  

 In controlled Phase 3 trials through Week 16 in patients with  RA≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ,  PsA≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , and  AS≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , serious  infections≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  were observed in 1.4% of SIMPONI-treated patients and 1.3% of control-treated patients. In the controlled Phase 3 trials through Week 16 in patients with  RA≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ,  PsA≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , and  AS≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , the incidence of serious  infections≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  per 100 patient-years of follow-up was 5.7 (95% CI: 3.8, 8.2) for the SIMPONI group and 4.2 (95% CI: 1.8, 8.2) for the placebo group. In the controlled Phase 2/3 trial through Week 6 of SIMPONI induction in  UC≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , the incidence of serious  infections≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  in SIMPONI 200/100 mg-treated patients was similar to the incidence of serious  infections≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  in placebo-treated patients. Through Week 60, the incidence of serious  infections≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was similar in patients who received SIMPONI induction and 100 mg during maintenance compared with patients who received SIMPONI induction and placebo during the maintenance portion of the  UC≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  trial. Serious  infections≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  observed in SIMPONI-treated patients included  sepsis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  pneumonia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  cellulitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  abscess≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  tuberculosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  invasive≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   fungal≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infections≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  hepatitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   B≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infection≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE .

    Tuberculosis  

 Cases of  reactivation≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   tuberculosis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  or new  tuberculosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   infections≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been observed in patients receiving TNF blockers, including patients who have previously received treatment for  latent≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or active  tuberculosis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Evaluate patients for  tuberculosis≠B-NonOSE_AE  risk factors and test for  latent≠B-NonOSE_AE   infection≠I-NonOSE_AE  prior to initiating SIMPONI and periodically during therapy.

 Treatment of  latent≠B-NonOSE_AE   tuberculosis≠I-NonOSE_AE   infection≠I-NonOSE_AE  prior to therapy with TNF blockers has been shown to reduce the risk of  tuberculosis≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactivation≠I-NonOSE_AE  during therapy. Prior to initiating SIMPONI, assess if treatment for  latent≠B-NonOSE_AE   tuberculosis≠I-NonOSE_AE  is needed; an induration of 5 mm or greater is a  positive≠B-NonOSE_AE   tuberculin≠I-NonOSE_AE   skin≠I-NonOSE_AE   test≠I-NonOSE_AE , even for patients previously vaccinated with  Bacille≠B-NonOSE_AE   Calmette≠I-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  Guerin≠I-NonOSE_AE   (≠I-NonOSE_AE  BCG≠I-NonOSE_AE ).

 Consider  anti≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  tuberculosis≠I-NonOSE_AE  therapy prior to initiation of SIMPONI in patients with a past history of  latent≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or active  tuberculosis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a  negative≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   test≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   for≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   latent≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   tuberculosis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  but having risk factors for  tuberculosis≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   infection≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of  tuberculosis≠B-NonOSE_AE  is recommended to aid in the decision whether initiating  anti≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  tuberculosis≠I-NonOSE_AE  therapy is appropriate for an individual patient.

 Cases of  active≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   tuberculosis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  have occurred in patients treated with SIMPONI during and after treatment for  latent≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   tuberculosis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of  tuberculosis≠B-NonOSE_AE  including patients who tested  negative≠B-NonOSE_AE   for≠I-NonOSE_AE   latent≠I-NonOSE_AE   tuberculosis≠I-NonOSE_AE   infection≠I-NonOSE_AE  prior to initiating therapy, patients who are on treatment for  latent≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   tuberculosis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , or patients who were previously treated for  tuberculosis≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   infection≠I-Not_AE_Candidate .

 Consider  tuberculosis≠B-NonOSE_AE  in the differential diagnosis in patients who develop a new  infection≠B-NonOSE_AE  during SIMPONI treatment, especially in patients who have previously or recently traveled to countries with a high prevalence of  tuberculosis≠B-NonOSE_AE , or who have had close contact with a person with  active≠B-NonOSE_AE   tuberculosis≠I-NonOSE_AE .

 In the controlled and uncontrolled portions of the Phase 2  RA≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and Phase 3  RA≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ,  PsA≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , and  AS≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  trials, the incidence of  active≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   TB≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  was 0.23 and 0 per 100 patient-years in 2347 SIMPONI-treated patients and 674 placebo-treated patients, respectively. Cases of  TB≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  included  pulmonary≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and extrapulmonary  TB≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . The overwhelming majority of the  TB≠B-NonOSE_AE  cases occurred in countries with a high incidence rate of  TB≠B-NonOSE_AE . In the controlled Phase 2/3 trial of SIMPONI induction through Week 6 in  UC≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , no cases of  TB≠B-NonOSE_AE  were observed in SIMPONI 200/100 mg-treated patients or in placebo-treated patients. Through Week 60, the incidence per 100 patient-years of  TB≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  in patients who received SIMPONI induction and 100 mg during the maintenance portion of the  UC≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  trial was 0.52 (95% CI: 0.11, 1.53). One case of  TB≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was observed in the placebo maintenance group in a patient who received SIMPONI intravenous (IV) induction.

     Invasive≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   Fungal≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   Infections≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   

 If patients develop a serious  systemic≠B-NonOSE_AE   illness≠I-NonOSE_AE  and they reside or travel in regions where  mycoses≠B-NonOSE_AE  are endemic, consider  invasive≠B-NonOSE_AE   fungal≠I-NonOSE_AE   infection≠I-NonOSE_AE  in the differential diagnosis. Consider appropriate empiric antifungal therapy, and take into account both the risk for severe  fungal≠B-NonOSE_AE   infection≠I-NonOSE_AE  and the risks of antifungal therapy while a diagnostic workup is being performed.  Antigen≠B-NonOSE_AE  and antibody  testing≠I-NonOSE_AE   for≠I-NonOSE_AE   histoplasmosis≠I-NonOSE_AE   may≠I-NonOSE_AE   be≠I-NonOSE_AE   negative≠I-NonOSE_AE  in some patients with  active≠B-NonOSE_AE   infection≠I-NonOSE_AE . To aid in the management of such patients, consider consultation with a physician with expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of  invasive≠B-NonOSE_AE   fungal≠I-NonOSE_AE   infections≠I-NonOSE_AE .

    Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation  

 The use of TNF blockers including SIMPONI has been associated with  reactivation≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   hepatitis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   B≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   virus≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  HBV≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ) in patients who are  chronic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   hepatitis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   B≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   carriers≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   (≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  i≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  .≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  e≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  .≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  ,≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   surface≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   antigen≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   positive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ). In some instances,  HBV≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactivation≠I-NonOSE_AE  occurring in conjunction with TNF blocker therapy has been  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE . The majority of these reports have occurred in patients who received concomitant  immunosuppressants≠B-NonOSE_AE .

 All patients should be tested for  HBV≠B-NonOSE_AE   infection≠I-NonOSE_AE  before initiating TNF-blocker therapy. For patients who test  positive≠B-NonOSE_AE   for≠I-NonOSE_AE   hepatitis≠I-NonOSE_AE   B≠I-NonOSE_AE   surface≠I-NonOSE_AE   antigen≠I-NonOSE_AE , consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of  hepatitis≠B-NonOSE_AE   B≠I-NonOSE_AE  is recommended before initiating TNF-blocker therapy. The risks and benefits of treatment should be considered prior to prescribing TNF blockers, including SIMPONI, to patients who are  carriers≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   of≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   HBV≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Adequate data are not available on whether antiviral therapy can reduce the risk of  HBV≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactivation≠I-NonOSE_AE  in  HBV≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   carriers≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  who are treated with TNF blockers. Patients who are  carriers≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   of≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   HBV≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and require treatment with TNF blockers should be closely monitored for clinical and laboratory signs of active  HBV≠B-NonOSE_AE   infection≠I-NonOSE_AE  throughout therapy and for several months following termination of therapy.

 In patients who develop  HBV≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactivation≠I-NonOSE_AE , TNF blockers should be stopped and antiviral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated. The safety of resuming TNF blockers after  HBV≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactivation≠I-NonOSE_AE  has been controlled is not known. Therefore, prescribers should exercise caution when considering resumption of TNF blockers in this situation and monitor patients closely.

    5.2 Malignancies

   Malignancies≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , some  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE , have been reported among children, adolescents, and young adults who received treatment with TNF-blocking agents (initiation of therapy <= 18 years of age), of which SIMPONI is a member. Approximately half the cases were  lymphomas≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , including  Hodgkin≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  '≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  s≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and non-Hodgkin's  lymphoma≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . The other cases represented a variety of  malignancies≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , including rare  malignancies≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  that are usually associated with  immunosuppression≠B-NonOSE_AE , and  malignancies≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  that are not usually observed in children and adolescents. The  malignancies≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred after a median of 30 months (range 1 to 84 months) after the first dose of TNF-blocker therapy. Most of the patients were receiving concomitant  immunosuppressants≠B-NonOSE_AE . These cases were reported postmarketing and are derived from a variety of sources, including registries and spontaneous postmarketing reports.

 The risks and benefits of TNF-blocker treatment, including SIMPONI, should be considered prior to initiating therapy in patients with a known  malignancy≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  other than a successfully treated  nonmelanoma≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   skin≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   (≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  NMSC≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ) or when considering continuing a TNF-blocker in patients who develop a  malignancy≠B-NonOSE_AE .

 In the controlled portions of clinical trials of TNF blockers, including SIMPONI, more cases of  lymphoma≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been observed among patients receiving anti-TNF treatment compared with patients in the control groups. During the controlled portions of the Phase 2 trials in  RA≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , and the Phase 3 trials in  RA≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ,  PsA≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and  AS≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , the incidence of  lymphoma≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  per 100 patient-years of follow-up was 0.21 (95% CI: 0.03, 0.77) in the combined SIMPONI group compared with an incidence of 0 (95% CI: 0, 0.96) in the placebo group. In the controlled and uncontrolled portions of these clinical trials in 2347 SIMPONI-treated patients with a median follow-up of 1.4 years, the incidence of  lymphoma≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was 3.8-fold higher than expected in the general U.S. population according to the SEER database (adjusted for age, gender, and race).  1  Through Week 60 of the  UC≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  trials, there were no cases of  lymphoma≠B-NonOSE_AE  with SIMPONI. Patients with  RA≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and other  chronic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   inflammatory≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   diseases≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , particularly patients with highly active disease and/or chronic exposure to  immunosuppressant≠B-NonOSE_AE   therapies≠I-NonOSE_AE , may be at higher risk (up to several fold) than the general population for the development of  lymphoma≠B-NonOSE_AE , even in the absence of TNF-blocking therapy. Cases of  acute≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and chronic  leukemia≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported with TNF-blocker use, including SIMPONI, in  rheumatoid≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   arthritis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and other indications. Even in the absence of TNF-blocker therapy, patients with  rheumatoid≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   arthritis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  may be at a higher risk (approximately 2-fold) than the general population for the development of  leukemia≠B-NonOSE_AE .

 Rare postmarketing cases of  hepatosplenic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   T≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  cell≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   lymphoma≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  HSTCL≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ) have been reported in patients treated with TNF-blocking agents. This rare type of  T≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  cell≠I-NonOSE_AE   lymphoma≠I-NonOSE_AE  has a very aggressive disease course and is usually  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE . Nearly all of the reported TNF blocker associated cases have occurred in patients with  Crohn≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  s≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  or  ulcerative≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   colitis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . The majority were in adolescent and young adult males. Almost all these patients had received treatment with azathioprine (AZA) or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. The potential risk with the combination of AZA or 6-MP and SIMPONI should be carefully considered. A risk for the development for  hepatosplenic≠B-NonOSE_AE   T≠I-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  cell≠I-NonOSE_AE   lymphoma≠I-NonOSE_AE  in patients treated with TNF blockers cannot be excluded.

 During the controlled portions of the Phase 2 trial in  RA≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , and the Phase 3 trials in  RA≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ,  PsA≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and  AS≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , the incidence of  malignancies≠B-NonOSE_AE  other than  lymphoma≠B-NonOSE_AE  per 100 patient-years of follow-up was not elevated in the combined SIMPONI group compared with the placebo group. In the controlled and uncontrolled portions of these trials, the incidence of  malignancies≠B-NonOSE_AE , other than  lymphoma≠B-NonOSE_AE , in SIMPONI-treated patients was similar to that expected in the general U.S. population according to the SEER database (adjusted for age, gender, and race).  1  In the 6-week placebo-controlled portions of the SIMPONI Phase 2/3 clinical trials in  UC≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , the incidence of  non≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  lymphoma≠I-NonOSE_AE   malignancies≠I-NonOSE_AE  (excluding  nonmelanoma≠B-NonOSE_AE   skin≠I-NonOSE_AE   cancer≠I-NonOSE_AE ) was similar between the SIMPONI and the placebo group. Through Week 60, the incidence of  non≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  lymphoma≠I-NonOSE_AE   malignancies≠I-NonOSE_AE  (excluding  nonmelanoma≠B-NonOSE_AE   skin≠I-NonOSE_AE   cancer≠I-NonOSE_AE ) was similar to the general U.S. population according to the SEER database (adjusted for age, gender, and race).  1  Short follow-up periods, such as those of one year or less in the studies above, may not adequately reflect the true incidence of  malignancies≠B-NonOSE_AE  .  

 It is not known if SIMPONI treatment influences the risk for developing  dysplasia≠B-NonOSE_AE  or  colon≠B-NonOSE_AE   cancer≠I-NonOSE_AE . All patients with  ulcerative≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   colitis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  who are at increased risk for  dysplasia≠B-NonOSE_AE  or  colon≠B-NonOSE_AE   carcinoma≠I-NonOSE_AE  (for example, patients with long-standing  ulcerative≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   colitis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  or  primary≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   sclerosing≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   cholangitis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ), or who had a prior history of  dysplasia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or  colon≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   carcinoma≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  should be screened for  dysplasia≠B-NonOSE_AE  at regular intervals before therapy and throughout their disease course. This evaluation should include colonoscopy and biopsies per local recommendations. In patients with newly diagnosed  dysplasia≠B-NonOSE_AE  treated with SIMPONI, the risks and benefits to the individual patient must be carefully reviewed and consideration should be given to whether therapy should be continued.

   Melanoma≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  Merkel≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   cell≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   carcinoma≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported in patients treated with TNF-blocking agents, including SIMPONI. Periodic skin examination is recommended for all patients, particularly those with risk factors for  skin≠B-NonOSE_AE   cancer≠I-NonOSE_AE .  

 In controlled trials of other TNF blockers in patients at higher risk for  malignancies≠B-NonOSE_AE  (e.g., patients with  chronic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   obstructive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   pulmonary≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   [≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  COPD≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ], patients with  Wegener≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  s≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   granulomatosis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  treated with concomitant cyclophosphamide) a greater portion of  malignancies≠B-NonOSE_AE  occurred in the TNF-blocker group compared to the controlled group. In an exploratory 1-year clinical trial evaluating the use of 50 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg of SIMPONI in 309 patients with severe persistent  asthma≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , 6 patients developed  malignancies≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  other than  NMSC≠B-NonOSE_AE  in the SIMPONI groups compared to none in the control group. Three of the 6 patients were in the 200-mg SIMPONI group.

    5.3 Congestive Heart Failure

  Cases of  worsening≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   congestive≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   heart≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   failure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  CHF≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ) and new onset  CHF≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported with TNF blockers, including SIMPONI. Some cases had a  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE  outcome. In several exploratory trials of other TNF blockers in the treatment of  CHF≠B-NonOSE_AE , there were greater proportions of TNF-blocker-treated patients who had  CHF≠B-NonOSE_AE   exacerbations≠I-NonOSE_AE  requiring hospitalization or increased  mortality≠B-NonOSE_AE . SIMPONI has not been studied in patients with a history of  CHF≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and SIMPONI should be used with caution in patients with  CHF≠B-Not_AE_Candidate . If a decision is made to administer SIMPONI to patients with  CHF≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , these patients should be closely monitored during therapy, and SIMPONI should be discontinued if new or worsening symptoms of  CHF≠B-NonOSE_AE  appear.

    5.4 Demyelinating Disorders

  Use of TNF blockers, of which SIMPONI is a member, has been associated with rare cases of new onset or exacerbation of  central≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   nervous≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   system≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  CNS≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  )≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   demyelinating≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   disorders≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , including  multiple≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   sclerosis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  MS≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ) and  peripheral≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   demyelinating≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   disorders≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , including  Guillain≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  Barre≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   syndrome≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . Cases of  central≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   demyelination≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  MS≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  optic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   neuritis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  peripheral≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   demyelinating≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   polyneuropathy≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  have rarely been reported in patients treated with SIMPONI [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Prescribers should exercise caution in considering the use of TNF blockers, including SIMPONI, in patients with  central≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or peripheral  nervous≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   system≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   demyelinating≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disorders≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Discontinuation of SIMPONI should be considered if these disorders develop.

    5.5  Autoimmunity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE 

  Treatment with TNF blockers, including SIMPONI, may result in the formation of  antinuclear≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   antibodies≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  ANA≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ) and, rarely, in the development of a  lupus≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  like≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   syndrome≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . If a patient develops symptoms suggestive of a  lupus≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  like≠I-NonOSE_AE   syndrome≠I-NonOSE_AE  following treatment with SIMPONI, treatment should be discontinued.

    5.6 Use with Abatacept

  In controlled trials, the concurrent administration of another TNF blocker and abatacept was associated with a greater proportion of serious  infections≠B-NonOSE_AE  than the use of a TNF blocker alone; and the combination therapy, compared to the use of a TNF blocker alone, has not demonstrated improved clinical benefit in the treatment of  RA≠B-Not_AE_Candidate . Therefore, the combination of TNF blockers, including SIMPONI, and abatacept is not recommended [see  Drug Interactions (7.2)  ]  .

    5.7 Use with Anakinra

  Concurrent administration of anakinra (an interleukin-1 antagonist) and another TNF blocker was associated with a greater portion of serious  infections≠B-NonOSE_AE  and  neutropenia≠B-NonOSE_AE  and no additional benefits compared with the TNF-blocker alone. Therefore, the combination of anakinra with TNF blockers, including SIMPONI, is not recommended [see  Drug Interactions (7.2)  ]  .

    5.8 Switching Between Biological Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs

  Care should be taken when switching from one biological product to another biological product since overlapping biological activity may further increase the risk of  infection≠B-NonOSE_AE .

    5.9  Hematologic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   Cytopenias≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE 

  There have been postmarketing reports of  pancytopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  leukopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  neutropenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  aplastic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   anemia≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  thrombocytopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  in patients receiving TNF blockers. In clinical trials, cases of  pancytopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  leukopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  neutropenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  thrombocytopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  have also occurred in SIMPONI-treated patients. Caution should be exercised when using TNF blockers, including SIMPONI, in patients who have or have had significant  cytopenias≠B-Not_AE_Candidate .

    5.10 Vaccinations/Therapeutic Infectious Agents

   Live Vaccines  

 Patients treated with SIMPONI may receive vaccinations, except for live vaccines. In patients receiving anti-TNF therapy, limited data are available on the response to live vaccination, or on the secondary transmission of  infection≠B-NonOSE_AE  by live vaccines. Use of live vaccines could result in clinical  infections≠B-NonOSE_AE , including  disseminated≠B-NonOSE_AE   infections≠I-NonOSE_AE .

    Therapeutic Infectious Agents  

 Other uses of  therapeutic≠B-NonOSE_AE   infectious≠I-NonOSE_AE   agents≠I-NonOSE_AE  such as live attenuated bacteria (e.g., BCG bladder instillation for the treatment of  cancer≠B-NonOSE_AE ) could result in clinical  infections≠B-NonOSE_AE , including  disseminated≠B-NonOSE_AE   infections≠I-NonOSE_AE . It is recommended that therapeutic  infectious≠B-NonOSE_AE  agents not be given concurrently with SIMPONI.

    Non-live Vaccines  

 In the Phase 3  PsA≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  trial, after  pneumococcal≠B-NonOSE_AE   vaccination≠I-NonOSE_AE , a similar proportion of SIMPONI-treated and placebo-treated patients were able to  mount≠B-NonOSE_AE   an≠I-NonOSE_AE   adequate≠I-NonOSE_AE   immune≠I-NonOSE_AE   response≠I-NonOSE_AE  of at least a 2-fold  increase≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   antibody≠I-NonOSE_AE   titers≠I-NonOSE_AE   to≠I-NonOSE_AE   pneumococcal≠I-NonOSE_AE   polysaccharide≠I-NonOSE_AE   vaccine≠I-NonOSE_AE . In both SIMPONI-treated and placebo-treated patients, the proportions of patients with response to  pneumococcal≠B-NonOSE_AE   vaccine≠I-NonOSE_AE  were lower among patients receiving MTX compared with patients not receiving MTX. The data suggest that SIMPONI does not  suppress≠B-NonOSE_AE   the≠I-NonOSE_AE   humoral≠I-NonOSE_AE   immune≠I-NonOSE_AE   response≠I-NonOSE_AE  to the  pneumococcal≠B-NonOSE_AE   vaccine≠I-NonOSE_AE .

    5.11 Hypersensitivity Reactions

  In postmarketing experience, serious systemic  hypersensitivity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (including  anaphylactic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reaction≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ) have been reported following SIMPONI administration. Some of these reactions occurred after the first administration of SIMPONI. If an  anaphylactic≠B-NonOSE_AE  or other serious allergic  reaction≠I-NonOSE_AE  occurs, administration of SIMPONI should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy instituted.
