  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. In the following description of clinical trials experience, adverse reactions are listed regardless of causality assessment.

 The most common adverse reactions (incidence >=5% and greater than placebo; listed in descending order of frequency) in controlled clinical trials were:  upper≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   respiratory≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infection≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  fever≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  headache≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  pharyngitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  cough≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  abdominal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  diarrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  otitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   media≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  influenza≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  rhinorrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  sinusitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  otitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .

 The safety profile of SINGULAIR, when administered as a single dose for prevention of  EIB≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  in adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older, was consistent with the safety profile previously described for SINGULAIR.

 Cumulatively, 569 patients were treated with SINGULAIR for at least 6 months, 480 for one year, and 49 for two years in clinical trials. With prolonged treatment, the adverse experience profile did not significantly change.

   Pediatric Patients 6 to 14 Years of Age with Asthma  

 SINGULAIR has been evaluated for safety in 476 pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age. Cumulatively, 289 pediatric patients were treated with SINGULAIR for at least 6 months, and 241 for one year or longer in clinical trials. The safety profile of SINGULAIR in the 8-week, double-blind, pediatric efficacy trial was generally similar to the adult safety profile. In pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age receiving SINGULAIR, the following events occurred with a frequency >=2% and more frequently than in pediatric patients who received placebo:  pharyngitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  influenza≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  fever≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  sinusitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  nausea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  diarrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  dyspepsia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  otitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  viral≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   infection≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  laryngitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . The frequency of less common adverse events was comparable between SINGULAIR and placebo. With prolonged treatment, the adverse experience profile did not significantly change.

 The safety profile of SINGULAIR, when administered as a single dose for prevention of  EIB≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older, was consistent with the safety profile previously described for SINGULAIR.

 In studies evaluating growth rate, the safety profile in these pediatric patients was consistent with the safety profile previously described for SINGULAIR. In a 56-week, double-blind study evaluating growth rate in pediatric patients 6 to 8 years of age receiving SINGULAIR, the following events not previously observed with the use of SINGULAIR in this age group occurred with a frequency >=2% and more frequently than in pediatric patients who received placebo:  headache≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  rhinitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  infective≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ),  varicella≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  gastroenteritis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  atopic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   dermatitis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  acute≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   bronchitis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  tooth≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   infection≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  skin≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   infection≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  myopia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .

   Pediatric Patients 2 to 5 Years of Age with Asthma  

 SINGULAIR has been evaluated for safety in 573 pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age in single- and multiple-dose studies. Cumulatively, 426 pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age were treated with SINGULAIR for at least 3 months, 230 for 6 months or longer, and 63 patients for one year or longer in clinical trials. In pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age receiving SINGULAIR, the following events occurred with a frequency >=2% and more frequently than in pediatric patients who received placebo:  fever≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  cough≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  abdominal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  diarrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  headache≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  rhinorrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  sinusitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  otitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  influenza≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  rash≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  ear≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  gastroenteritis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  eczema≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  urticaria≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  varicella≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  pneumonia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  dermatitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  conjunctivitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .

   Pediatric Patients 6 to 23 Months of Age with Asthma  

 Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients younger than 12 months of age with  asthma≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  have not been established.

 SINGULAIR has been evaluated for safety in 175 pediatric patients 6 to 23 months of age. The safety profile of SINGULAIR in a 6-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study was generally similar to the safety profile in adults and pediatric patients 2 to 14 years of age. In pediatric patients 6 to 23 months of age receiving SINGULAIR, the following events occurred with a frequency >=2% and more frequently than in pediatric patients who received placebo:  upper≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   respiratory≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infection≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  wheezing≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ;  otitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   media≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ;  pharyngitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  tonsillitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  cough≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ; and  rhinitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . The frequency of less common adverse events was comparable between SINGULAIR and placebo.

   Adults and Adolescents 15 Years of Age and Older with Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis  

 SINGULAIR has been evaluated for safety in 2199 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older in clinical trials. SINGULAIR administered once daily in the morning or in the evening had a safety profile similar to that of placebo. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following event was reported with SINGULAIR with a frequency >=1% and at an incidence greater than placebo:  upper≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   respiratory≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infection≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , 1.9% of patients receiving SINGULAIR vs. 1.5% of patients receiving placebo. In a 4-week, placebo-controlled clinical study, the safety profile was consistent with that observed in 2-week studies. The incidence of  somnolence≠B-NonOSE_AE  was similar to that of placebo in all studies.

   Pediatric Patients 2 to 14 Years of Age with Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis  

 SINGULAIR has been evaluated in 280 pediatric patients 2 to 14 years of age in a 2-week, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group safety study. SINGULAIR administered once daily in the evening had a safety profile similar to that of placebo. In this study, the following events occurred with a frequency >=2% and at an incidence greater than placebo:  headache≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  otitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   media≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  pharyngitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  upper≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   respiratory≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infection≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE .

   Adults and Adolescents 15 Years of Age and Older with Perennial Allergic Rhinitis  

 SINGULAIR has been evaluated for safety in 3357 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older with  perennial≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   allergic≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   rhinitis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  of whom 1632 received SINGULAIR in two, 6-week, clinical studies. SINGULAIR administered once daily had a safety profile consistent with that observed in patients with  seasonal≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   allergic≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   rhinitis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and similar to that of placebo. In these two studies, the following events were reported with SINGULAIR with a frequency >=1% and at an incidence greater than placebo:  sinusitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  upper≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   respiratory≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infection≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  sinus≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   headache≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  cough≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  epistaxis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  increased≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   ALT≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . The incidence of  somnolence≠B-NonOSE_AE  was similar to that of placebo.

   Pediatric Patients 6 Months to 14 Years of Age with Perennial Allergic Rhinitis  

 The safety in patients 2 to 14 years of age with  perennial≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   allergic≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   rhinitis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  is supported by the safety in patients 2 to 14 years of age with  seasonal≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   allergic≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   rhinitis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . The safety in patients 6 to 23 months of age is supported by data from pharmacokinetic and safety and efficacy studies in  asthma≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  in this pediatric population and from adult pharmacokinetic studies.

   6.2 Post-Marketing Experience
