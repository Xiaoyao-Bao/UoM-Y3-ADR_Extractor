    Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.
 

    EXCERPT:    *    Common adverse reactions (>=5%): nausea, diarrhea, pyrexia, nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, insomnia, pain in extremity, depression, migraine, pharyngitis, and injection site reactions (subcutaneous administration). (  6.1  ,  6.2  )

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience with Intravenous Administration

  The data described below reflect exposure to BENLYSTA administered intravenously plus standard therapy compared with placebo plus standard therapy in 2,133 patients in 3 controlled trials. Patients received BENLYSTA plus standard therapy at doses of 1 mg/kg (n = 673), 4 mg/kg (n = 111; Trial 1 only), or 10 mg/kg (n = 674), or placebo plus standard therapy (n = 675) intravenously over a 1-hour period on Days 0, 14, 28, and then every 28 days. In 2 of the trials (Trial 1 and Trial 3), treatment was given for 48 weeks, while in the other trial (Trial 2) treatment was given for 72 weeks  [see Clinical Studies (  14.1  )]  . Because there was no apparent dose-related increase in the majority of adverse events observed with BENLYSTA, the safety data summarized below are presented for the 3 intravenous doses pooled, unless otherwise indicated; the adverse reaction table displays the results for the recommended intravenous dose of 10 mg/kg compared with placebo.

 The population had a mean age of 39 years (range: 18 to 75), 94% were female, and 52% were white. In these trials, 93% of patients treated with BENLYSTA plus standard therapy reported an adverse event compared with 92% treated with placebo plus standard therapy.

 The most common serious adverse events were serious  infections≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (6.0% and 5.2% in the groups receiving BENLYSTA and placebo plus standard therapy, respectively), some of which were  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE   [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )]  .

 The most commonly reported adverse events, occurring in >=5% of patients in clinical trials were  nausea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  diarrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  pyrexia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  nasopharyngitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  bronchitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  insomnia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  pain≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   extremity≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  depression≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  migraine≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  pharyngitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .

 The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to any adverse reaction during the controlled clinical trials was 6.2% for patients receiving BENLYSTA plus standard therapy and 7.1% for patients receiving placebo plus standard therapy. The most common adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of treatment (>=1% of patients receiving BENLYSTA or placebo) were  infusion≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (1.6% BENLYSTA and 0.9% placebo),  lupus≠B-NonOSE_AE   nephritis≠I-NonOSE_AE  (0.7% BENLYSTA and 1.2% placebo), and  infections≠B-NonOSE_AE  (0.7% BENLYSTA and 1.0% placebo).

   Table 1  lists adverse reactions, regardless of causality, occurring in at least 3% of patients with  SLE≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  who received BENLYSTA 10 mg/kg plus standard therapy and at an incidence at least 1% greater than that observed with placebo plus standard therapy in the 3 controlled studies.

           6.2 Clinical Trials Experience with Subcutaneous Administration
   The data described below reflect exposure to BENLYSTA administered subcutaneously plus standard therapy compared with placebo plus standard therapy in 836 patients in a controlled trial (Trial 4). In addition to standard therapy, patients received BENLYSTA 200 mg (n = 556) or placebo (n = 280) (2:1 randomization) once weekly for up to 52 weeks  [see Clinical Studies (  14.2  )]  .

 The overall population had a mean age of 39 years (range: 18 to 77), 94% were female, and 60% were white. In the trial, 81% of patients treated with BENLYSTA plus standard therapy reported an adverse event compared with 84% treated with placebo plus standard therapy. The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to any adverse reaction during the controlled clinical trial was 7.2% of patients receiving BENLYSTA plus standard therapy and 8.9% of patients receiving placebo plus standard therapy.

 The safety profile observed for BENLYSTA administered subcutaneously plus standard therapy was consistent with the known safety profile of BENLYSTA administered intravenously plus standard therapy, with the exception of local  injection≠B-NonOSE_AE   site≠I-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE .

   Injection Site Reactions  

 In the clinical study for BENLYSTA administered subcutaneously, the frequency of  injection≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   site≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  was 6.1% (34/556) for patients receiving BENLYSTA plus standard therapy and 2.5% (7/280) for patients receiving placebo plus standard therapy. These  injection≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   site≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (most commonly pain, erythema, hematoma, pruritus, and induration) were mild to moderate in severity. The majority (94%) did not necessitate discontinuation of treatment.

   6.3 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of BENLYSTA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

 *     Fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE   anaphylaxis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  )] . 
      6.4 Immunogenicity
   As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for  immunogenicity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . The detection of  antibody≠B-NonOSE_AE   formation≠I-NonOSE_AE  is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of  antibody≠B-NonOSE_AE  (including neutralizing a ntibody≠B-NonOSE_AE  )≠I-NonOSE_AE    positivity≠I-NonOSE_AE  ≠≠I-NonOSE_AE I-NonOSE_AE  in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of  antibodies≠B-NonOSE_AE   to≠I-NonOSE_AE   belimumab≠I-NonOSE_AE  with the incidence of  antibodies≠B-NonOSE_AE  in other studies or to other products may be misleading.

 In Trials 2 and 3 (intravenous dosing),  anti≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  belimumab≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   antibodies≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  were detected in 4 of 563 (0.7%) patients receiving BENLYSTA 10 mg/kg and in 27 of 559 (4.8%) patients receiving BENLYSTA 1 mg/kg. The reported frequency for the group receiving 10 mg/kg may underestimate the actual frequency due to lower assay sensitivity in the presence of high drug concentrations.  Neutralizing≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   antibodies≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  were  detected≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  in 3 patients receiving BENLYSTA 1 mg/kg. Three patients with  anti≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  belimumab≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   antibodies≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  experienced mild  infusion≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  of  nausea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  erythematous≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   rash≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  pruritus≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  eyelid≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   edema≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  headache≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  dyspnea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ; none of the reactions was life-threatening. In Trial 4 (subcutaneous dosing), there was no formation of  anti≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  belimumab≠I-NonOSE_AE   antibodies≠I-NonOSE_AE  in 556 patients receiving BENLYSTA 200 mg during the 52-week placebo-controlled period. The clinical relevance of the presence of  anti≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  belimumab≠I-NonOSE_AE   antibodies≠I-NonOSE_AE  is not known.

 The data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were  positive≠B-NonOSE_AE   for≠I-NonOSE_AE   antibodies≠I-NonOSE_AE   to≠I-NonOSE_AE   belimumab≠I-NonOSE_AE  in specific assays.
