  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

     Sitagliptin and Metformin Coadministration in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Inadequately Controlled on Diet and Exercise  

 Table 1 summarizes the most common (>=5% of patients) adverse reactions reported (regardless of investigator assessment of causality) in a 24-week placebo-controlled factorial study in which sitagliptin and metformin were coadministered to patients with  type≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   2≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   diabetes≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  inadequately controlled on diet and exercise.

               Sitagliptin Add-on Therapy in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Inadequately Controlled on Metformin Alone  
 

 In a 24-week placebo-controlled trial of sitagliptin 100 mg administered once daily added to a twice daily metformin regimen, there were no adverse reactions reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in >=5% of patients and more commonly than in patients given placebo. Discontinuation of therapy due to clinical adverse reactions was similar to the placebo treatment group (sitagliptin and metformin, 1.9%; placebo and metformin, 2.5%).

     Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions  

 The incidences of pre-selected  gastrointestinal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   adverse≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   experiences≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  in patients treated with sitagliptin and metformin were similar to those reported for patients treated with metformin alone. See  Table 2  .

     Sitagliptin in Combination with Metformin and Insulin  

 In a 24-week placebo-controlled study of sitagliptin 100 mg as add-on therapy in patients with  type≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   2≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   diabetes≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  inadequately controlled on metformin and insulin (sitagliptin, N=229; placebo, N=233), the only adverse reaction reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in >=5% of patients treated with sitagliptin and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo was  hypoglycemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (Table 3).

     Hypoglycemia  

 In all (N=5) studies, adverse reactions of  hypoglycemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  were based on all reports of symptomatic  hypoglycemia≠B-NonOSE_AE ; a concurrent glucose measurement was not required although most (77%) reports of  hypoglycemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  were accompanied by a  blood≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   glucose≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   measurement≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   <≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  =≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  7≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  0≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   mg≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  /≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  dL≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . When the combination of sitagliptin and metformin was coadministered with a sulfonylurea or with insulin, the percentage of patients reporting at least one adverse reaction of  hypoglycemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  was higher than that observed with placebo and metformin coadministered with a sulfonylurea or with insulin (Table 3).

In patients with  type≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   2≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   diabetes≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  inadequately controlled on metformin alone, the overall incidence of adverse reactions of  hypoglycemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  was 1.3% in patients given add-on sitagliptin and 2.1% in patients given add-on placebo.
 

 In the study of sitagliptin and add-on combination therapy with metformin and rosiglitazone, the overall incidence of  hypoglycemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was 2.2% in patients given add-on sitagliptin and 0.0% in patients given add-on placebo through Week 18. Through Week 54, the overall incidence of  hypoglycemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was 3.9% in patients given add-on sitagliptin and 1.0% in patients given add-on placebo.

     Vital Signs and Electrocardiograms  

 With the combination of sitagliptin and metformin, no clinically meaningful  changes≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   vital≠I-NonOSE_AE   signs≠I-NonOSE_AE  or in ECG (including in QTc interval) were observed.

     Pancreatitis  

 In a pooled analysis of 19 double-blind clinical trials that included data from 10,246 patients randomized to receive sitagliptin 100 mg/day (N=5429) or corresponding (active or placebo) control (N=4817), the incidence of  acute≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pancreatitis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  was 0.1 per 100 patient-years in each group (4 patients with an event in 4708 patient-years for sitagliptin and 4 patients with an event in 3942 patient-years for control).  [See  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  .]  

     Sitagliptin  

 The most common adverse experience in sitagliptin monotherapy reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in >=5% of patients and more commonly than in patients given placebo was  nasopharyngitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .

     Metformin hydrochloride  

 The most common (>5%) established adverse reactions due to initiation of metformin therapy are  diarrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  nausea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE / vomiting≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  flatulence≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  abdominal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   discomfort≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  indigestion≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  asthenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  headache≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .

     Laboratory Tests  

     Sitagliptin  

 The incidence of  laboratory≠B-NonOSE_AE   adverse≠I-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE  was similar in patients treated with sitagliptin and metformin (7.6%) compared to patients treated with placebo and metformin (8.7%).

This change in laboratory parameters is not considered to be clinically relevant.

     Metformin hydrochloride  

 In controlled clinical trials of metformin of 29 weeks duration, a  decrease≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   to≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   subnormal≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  levels of previously normal serum  Vitamin≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   B≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  1≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  2≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  levels≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to  interference≠B-NonOSE_AE   with≠I-NonOSE_AE   B≠I-NonOSE_AE  1≠I-NonOSE_AE  2≠I-NonOSE_AE  absorption≠I-NonOSE_AE  from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, is, however, very rarely associated with  anemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  and appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or Vitamin B12supplementation.  [See  Warnings and Precautions (5.5)  .]  

   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  Additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of JANUMET, sitagliptin, or metformin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
