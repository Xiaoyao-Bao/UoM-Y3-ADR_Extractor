   5.1 Infusion Reactions

  Rituxan can cause severe, including  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  infusion≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . Severe reactions typically occurred during the first infusion with time to onset of 30-120 minutes.  Rituxan≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  induced≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infusion≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and sequelae include  urticaria≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  hypotension≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  angioedema≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  hypoxia≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  bronchospasm≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  pulmonary≠B-NonOSE_AE   infiltrates≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  acute≠B-NonOSE_AE   respiratory≠I-NonOSE_AE   distress≠I-NonOSE_AE   syndrome≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  myocardial≠B-NonOSE_AE   infarction≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  ventricular≠B-NonOSE_AE   fibrillation≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  cardiogenic≠B-NonOSE_AE   shock≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  anaphylactoid≠B-NonOSE_AE   events≠I-NonOSE_AE , or  death≠B-NonOSE_AE .

 Premedicate patients with an antihistamine and acetaminophen prior to dosing. For  RA≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  patients, methylprednisolone 100 mg intravenously or its equivalent is recommended 30 minutes prior to each infusion. Institute medical management (e.g. glucocorticoids, epinephrine, bronchodilators, or oxygen) for  infusion≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE  as needed. Depending on the severity of the  infusion≠B-NonOSE_AE   reaction≠I-NonOSE_AE  and the required interventions, temporarily or permanently discontinue Rituxan. Resume infusion at a minimum 50% reduction in rate after symptoms have resolved. Closely monitor the following patients: those with pre-existing  cardiac≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or pulmonary  conditions≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , those who experienced prior  cardiopulmonary≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   adverse≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   reactions≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , and those with  high≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   numbers≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   of≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   circulating≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   malignant≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   cells≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   (≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   >≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  =≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   2≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  5≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  ,≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  0≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  0≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  0≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  /≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  mm≠I-Not_AE_Candidate    3≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   ). [ See  Boxed Warning  ,  Warnings and Precautions (5.7)  ,  Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ].

    5.2 Severe Mucocutaneous Reactions

   Mucocutaneous≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , some with  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE  outcome, can occur in patients treated with Rituxan. These reactions include  paraneoplastic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pemphigus≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  Stevens≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  Johnson≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   syndrome≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  lichenoid≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   dermatitis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  vesiculobullous≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   dermatitis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  toxic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   epidermal≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   necrolysis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . The onset of these reactions has been variable and includes reports with onset on the first day of Rituxan exposure. Discontinue Rituxan in patients who experience a severe  mucocutaneous≠B-NonOSE_AE   reaction≠I-NonOSE_AE . The safety of readministration of Rituxan to patients with severe  mucocutaneous≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE  has not been determined. [ See  Boxed Warning  ,  Adverse Reactions (6  )  ].

    5.3 Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation

   Hepatitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   B≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   virus≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  HBV≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  )≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactivation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , in some cases resulting in fulminant  hepatitis≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  hepatic≠B-NonOSE_AE   failure≠I-NonOSE_AE  and  death≠B-NonOSE_AE , can occur in patients treated with drugs classified as  CD≠B-NonOSE_AE  2≠I-NonOSE_AE  0≠I-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  directed≠I-NonOSE_AE   cytolytic≠I-NonOSE_AE   antibodies≠I-NonOSE_AE , including Rituxan. Cases have been reported in patients who are  hepatitis≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   B≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   surface≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   antigen≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   (≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  HBsAg≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  )≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   positive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and also in patients who are  HBsAg≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   negative≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  but are  hepatitis≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   B≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   core≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   antibody≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   (≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  anti≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  HBc≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  )≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   positive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Reactivation also has occurred in patients who appear to have resolved  hepatitis≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   B≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   infection≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   (≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  i≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  .≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  e≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  .≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  ,≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   HBsAg≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   negative≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  anti≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  HBc≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   positive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and  hepatitis≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   B≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   surface≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   antibody≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   [≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  anti≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  HBs≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  ]≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   positive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ).

  HBV≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactivation≠I-NonOSE_AE  is defined as an abrupt  increase≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   HBV≠I-NonOSE_AE   replication≠I-NonOSE_AE  manifesting as a rapid  increase≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   serum≠I-NonOSE_AE   HBV≠I-NonOSE_AE   DNA≠I-NonOSE_AE   level≠I-NonOSE_AE  or  detection≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   HBsAg≠I-NonOSE_AE  in a person who was previously  HBsAg≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   negative≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and  anti≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  HBc≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   positive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate .  Reactivation≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   HBV≠I-NonOSE_AE   replication≠I-NonOSE_AE  is often followed by  hepatitis≠B-NonOSE_AE , i.e.,  increase≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   transaminase≠I-NonOSE_AE   levels≠I-NonOSE_AE . In severe cases  increase≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   bilirubin≠I-NonOSE_AE   levels≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  liver≠B-NonOSE_AE   failure≠I-NonOSE_AE , and  death≠B-NonOSE_AE  can occur.

 Screen all patients for  HBV≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   infection≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  by measuring HBsAg and anti-HBc before initiating treatment with Rituxan. For patients who show evidence of prior  hepatitis≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   B≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   infection≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  ( HBsAg≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   positive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  [regardless of  antibody≠B-NonOSE_AE  status] or  HBsAg≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   negative≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  but  anti≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  HBc≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   positive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ), consult with physicians with expertise in managing  hepatitis≠B-NonOSE_AE   B≠I-NonOSE_AE  regarding monitoring and consideration for  HBV≠B-NonOSE_AE  antiviral therapy before and/or during Rituxan treatment.

 Monitor patients with evidence of current or prior  HBV≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   infection≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  for clinical and laboratory signs of  hepatitis≠B-NonOSE_AE  or  HBV≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactivation≠I-NonOSE_AE  during and for several months following Rituxan therapy.  HBV≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactivation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  has been reported up to 24 months following completion of Rituxan therapy.

 In patients who develop  reactivation≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   HBV≠I-NonOSE_AE  while on Rituxan, immediately discontinue Rituxan and any concomitant chemotherapy, and institute appropriate treatment. Insufficient data exist regarding the safety of resuming Rituxan in patients who develop  HBV≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactivation≠I-NonOSE_AE . Resumption of Rituxan in patients whose  HBV≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactivation≠I-NonOSE_AE  resolves should be discussed with physicians with expertise in managing hepatitis B. [ See  Boxed Warning  ,  Adverse Reactions (6)    ]

    5.4  Progressive≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   Multifocal≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   Leukoencephalopathy≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  PML≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE )

   JC≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   virus≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infection≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  resulting in  PML≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  death≠B-NonOSE_AE  can occur in Rituxan-treated patients with  hematologic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   malignancies≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  or with  autoimmune≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   diseases≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . The majority of patients with  hematologic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   malignancies≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  diagnosed with  PML≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  received Rituxan in combination with chemotherapy or as part of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The patients with  autoimmune≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   diseases≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  had prior or concurrent immunosuppressive therapy. Most cases of  PML≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  were diagnosed within 12 months of their last infusion of Rituxan.

 Consider the diagnosis of  PML≠B-NonOSE_AE  in any patient presenting with new-onset neurologic manifestations. Evaluation of  PML≠B-NonOSE_AE  includes, but is not limited to, consultation with a neurologist, brain MRI, and lumbar puncture. Discontinue Rituxan and consider discontinuation or reduction of any concomitant chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy in patients who develop  PML≠B-NonOSE_AE . [ See  Boxed Warning  ,  Adverse Reactions (6)    ].

    5.5  Tumor≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   Lysis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   Syndrome≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  TLS≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE )

   Acute≠B-NonOSE_AE   renal≠I-NonOSE_AE   failure≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  hyperkalemia≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  hypocalcemia≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  hyperuricemia≠B-NonOSE_AE , or  hyperphosphatemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  from  tumor≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   lysis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , some  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE , can occur within 12-24 hours after the first infusion of Rituxan in patients with  NHL≠B-Not_AE_Candidate . A  high≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   number≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   of≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   circulating≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   malignant≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   cells≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   (≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   >≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  =≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   2≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  5≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  ,≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  0≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  0≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  0≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  /≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  mm≠I-Not_AE_Candidate    3≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   ) or high  tumor≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  burden, confers a greater risk of  TLS≠B-NonOSE_AE .

 Administer aggressive intravenous hydration and anti-hyperuricemic therapy in patients at high risk for  TLS≠B-NonOSE_AE . Correct  electrolyte≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   abnormalities≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , monitor renal function and fluid balance, and administer supportive care, including dialysis as indicated. [ See  Warnings and Precautions (5.8)  ,  Adverse Reactions (6)    ].

    5.6 Infections

  Serious, including  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  bacterial≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , fungal, and new or reactivated viral  infections≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  can occur during and following the completion of Rituxan-based therapy.  Infections≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported in some patients with prolonged  hypogammaglobulinemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  (defined as  hypogammaglobulinemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  >11 months after rituximab exposure). New or reactivated  viral≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   infections≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  included  cytomegalovirus≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  herpes≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   simplex≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   virus≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  parvovirus≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   B≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  1≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  9≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  varicella≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   zoster≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   virus≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  West≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   Nile≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   virus≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  hepatitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   B≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and C. Discontinue Rituxan for serious  infections≠B-NonOSE_AE  and institute appropriate anti-infective therapy. [ See  Adverse Reactions (6  ,  6.1)    ].

    5.7  Cardiovascular≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE 

  Discontinue infusions for serious or life-threatening  cardiac≠B-NonOSE_AE   arrhythmias≠I-NonOSE_AE . Perform cardiac monitoring during and after all infusions of Rituxan for patients who develop clinically significant  arrhythmias≠B-NonOSE_AE , or who have a history of  arrhythmia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or  angina≠B-Not_AE_Candidate . [ See  Adverse Reactions (6)    ].

    5.8 Renal

  Severe, including  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  renal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   toxicity≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  can occur after Rituxan administration in patients with  NHL≠B-Not_AE_Candidate .  Renal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   toxicity≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  has occurred in patients who experience  tumor≠B-NonOSE_AE   lysis≠I-NonOSE_AE   syndrome≠I-NonOSE_AE  and in patients with  NHL≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  administered concomitant cisplatin therapy during clinical trials. The combination of cisplatin and Rituxan is not an approved treatment regimen. Monitor closely for signs of  renal≠B-NonOSE_AE   failure≠I-NonOSE_AE  and discontinue Rituxan in patients with a  rising≠B-NonOSE_AE   serum≠I-NonOSE_AE   creatinine≠I-NonOSE_AE  or  oliguria≠B-NonOSE_AE . [ See  Warnings and Precautions (5.5)    ].

    5.9 Bowel Obstruction and Perforation

   Abdominal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  bowel≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   obstruction≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and perforation, in some cases leading to  death≠B-NonOSE_AE , can occur in patients receiving Rituxan in combination with chemotherapy. In postmarketing reports, the mean time to documented  gastrointestinal≠B-NonOSE_AE  perforation was 6 (range 1-77) days in patients with NHL. Evaluate  if≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  symptoms of  obstruction≠I-NonOSE_AE  such as  abdominal≠B-NonOSE_AE   pain≠I-NonOSE_AE  or repeated  vomiting≠B-NonOSE_AE  occur. [ See  Adverse Reactions (6)    ].

    5.10 Immunization

  The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines following Rituxan therapy has not been studied and vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended.

 For  RA≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  patients, physicians should follow current immunization guidelines and administer non-live vaccines at least 4 weeks prior to a course of Rituxan.

 The effect of Rituxan on immune responses was assessed in a randomized, controlled study in patients with  RA≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  treated with Rituxan and methotrexate (MTX) compared to patients treated with MTX alone.

 A positive response to tetanus toxoid vaccine (a T-cell dependent antigen with existing immunity) was similar in patients treated with Rituxan plus MTX compared to patients on MTX alone (39% vs. 42%). The proportion of patients maintaining a  positive≠B-NonOSE_AE   Candida≠I-NonOSE_AE   skin≠I-NonOSE_AE   test≠I-NonOSE_AE  (to evaluate delayed type  hypersensitivity≠B-NonOSE_AE ) was also similar (77% of patients on Rituxan plus MTX vs. 70% of patients on MTX alone).

 Most patients in the Rituxan-treated group had  B≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  cell≠I-NonOSE_AE   counts≠I-NonOSE_AE   below≠I-NonOSE_AE   the≠I-NonOSE_AE   lower≠I-NonOSE_AE   limit≠I-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   normal≠I-NonOSE_AE  at the time of immunization. The clinical implications of these findings are not known.

    5.11 Laboratory Monitoring

  In patients with  lymphoid≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   malignancies≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , during treatment with Rituxan monotherapy, obtain complete blood counts (CBC) and platelet counts prior to each Rituxan course. During treatment with Rituxan and chemotherapy, obtain CBC and platelet counts at weekly to monthly intervals and more frequently in patients who develop  cytopenias≠B-NonOSE_AE  [ See  Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ] .  In patients with  RA≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ,  GPA≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or  MPA≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , obtain CBC and platelet counts at two to four month intervals during Rituxan therapy. The duration of  cytopenias≠B-NonOSE_AE  caused by Rituxan can extend months beyond the treatment period.

    5.12 Concomitant Use with Biologic Agents and DMARDS other than Methotrexate in RA, GPA and MPA

  Limited data are available on the safety of the use of biologic agents or DMARDs other than methotrexate in  RA≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  patients exhibiting peripheral  B≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  cell≠I-NonOSE_AE   depletion≠I-NonOSE_AE  following treatment with rituximab. Observe patients closely for signs of  infection≠B-NonOSE_AE  if biologic agents and/or DMARDs are used concomitantly. Use of concomitant immunosuppressants other than corticosteroids has not been studied in  GPA≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or  MPA≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  patients exhibiting peripheral  B≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  cell≠I-NonOSE_AE   depletion≠I-NonOSE_AE  following treatment with Rituxan.

    5.13 Use in RA Patients Who Have Not Had Prior Inadequate Response to Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) Antagonists

  While the efficacy of Rituxan was supported in four controlled trials in patients with  RA≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  with prior inadequate responses to non-biologic DMARDs, and in a controlled trial in MTX-naive patients, a favorable risk-benefit relationship has not been established in these populations. The use of Rituxan in patients with  RA≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  who have not had prior inadequate response to one or more TNF antagonists is not recommended [ See  Clinical Studies (14.6)    ].

    5.14 Retreatment in Patients with Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA) (Wegener's Granulomatosis) and Microscopic Polyangiitis (MPA)

  Limited data are available on the safety and efficacy of subsequent courses of Rituxan in patients with  GPA≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and  MPA≠B-Not_AE_Candidate . The safety and efficacy of retreatment with Rituxan have not been established [ See  Dosage and Administration (2.6)  ,  Adverse Reactions (6.3)  , and  Clinical Studies (14.7)    ] .
