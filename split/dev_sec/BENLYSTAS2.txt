   5.1 Mortality

  There were more  deaths≠B-NonOSE_AE  reported with BENLYSTA than with placebo during the controlled period of the intravenous clinical trials. Out of 2,133 patients in 3 clinical trials, a total of 14  deaths≠B-NonOSE_AE  occurred during the placebo-controlled, double-blind treatment periods: 3/675 (0.4%), 5/673 (0.7%), 0/111 (0%), and 6/674 (0.9%)  deaths≠B-NonOSE_AE  in the groups receiving placebo, BENLYSTA 1 mg/kg, BENLYSTA 4 mg/kg, and BENLYSTA 10 mg/kg, respectively. No single cause of  death≠B-NonOSE_AE  predominated. Etiologies included  infection≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  cardiovascular≠B-NonOSE_AE   disease≠I-NonOSE_AE , and  suicide≠B-NonOSE_AE .

  In the controlled trial of BENLYSTA administered subcutaneously (N = 836), a total of 5  deaths≠B-NonOSE_AE  occurred during the placebo-controlled, double-blind treatment period (0.7% [2/280] of patients receiving placebo and 0.5% [3/556] of patients receiving BENLYSTA).  Infection≠B-NonOSE_AE  was the most common cause of  death≠B-NonOSE_AE .  

    5.2 Serious Infections

  Serious and sometimes  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE   infections≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported in patients receiving  immunosuppressive≠B-NonOSE_AE   agents≠I-NonOSE_AE , including BENLYSTA. Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use of BENLYSTA in patients with severe or chronic  infections≠B-Not_AE_Candidate . Consider interrupting therapy with BENLYSTA in patients who develop a new  infection≠B-NonOSE_AE  while undergoing treatment with BENLYSTA and monitor these patients closely.

 In the controlled clinical trials of BENLYSTA administered intravenously, the overall incidence of  infections≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was 71% in patients treated with BENLYSTA compared with 67% in patients who received placebo. The most frequent  infections≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (>5% of patients receiving BENLYSTA) were  upper≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   respiratory≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   tract≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infection≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  urinary≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   tract≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infection≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  nasopharyngitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  sinusitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  bronchitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  influenza≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . Serious  infections≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred in 6.0% of patients treated with BENLYSTA and in 5.2% of patients who received placebo. The most frequent serious  infections≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  included  pneumonia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  urinary≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   tract≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infection≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  cellulitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  bronchitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .  Infections≠B-NonOSE_AE  leading to discontinuation of treatment occurred in 0.7% of patients receiving BENLYSTA and 1.0% of patients receiving placebo.  Infections≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  resulting in  death≠B-NonOSE_AE  occurred in 0.3% (4/1,458) of patients treated with BENLYSTA and in 0.1% (1/675) of patients receiving placebo.

  In the controlled trial of BENLYSTA administered subcutaneously (N = 836), the overall incidence of  infections≠B-NonOSE_AE  was 55% in patients treated with BENLYSTA compared with 57% in patients who received placebo (serious  infections≠B-NonOSE_AE : 4.1% with BENLYSTA and 5.4% with placebo). The most commonly reported  infections≠B-NonOSE_AE  with BENLYSTA administered subcutaneously were similar to those reported with BENLYSTA administered intravenously.  

   Progressive≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   Multifocal≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   Leukoencephalopathy≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  PML≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE )  

 Cases of  JC≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   virus≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  associated≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   PML≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  resulting in  neurological≠B-NonOSE_AE   deficits≠I-NonOSE_AE , including  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE  cases, have been reported in patients with  SLE≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  receiving  immunosuppressants≠B-NonOSE_AE , including BENLYSTA. Risk factors for  PML≠B-NonOSE_AE  include treatment with  immunosuppressant≠B-NonOSE_AE   therapies≠I-NonOSE_AE  and  impairment≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   immune≠I-NonOSE_AE   function≠I-NonOSE_AE . Consider the diagnosis of  PML≠B-NonOSE_AE  in any patient presenting with new-onset or deteriorating  neurological≠B-NonOSE_AE   signs≠I-NonOSE_AE  and symptoms and consult with a neurologist or other appropriate specialist as clinically indicated. In patients with confirmed  PML≠B-NonOSE_AE , consider stopping  immunosuppressant≠B-NonOSE_AE   therapy≠I-NonOSE_AE , including BENLYSTA.

    5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions, including Anaphylaxis

  Acute  hypersensitivity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , including  anaphylaxis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  death≠B-NonOSE_AE , have been reported in association with BENLYSTA. These events generally occurred within hours of the infusion; however, they may occur later. Non-acute  hypersensitivity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  including  rash≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  nausea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  fatigue≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  myalgia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  headache≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  facial≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   edema≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , have been reported and typically occurred up to a week following the most recent infusion.  Hypersensitivity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , including serious reactions, has occurred in patients who have previously tolerated infusions of BENLYSTA. Limited data suggest that patients with a history of multiple  drug≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   allergies≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  or significant  hypersensitivity≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  may be at increased risk.

 In the controlled clinical trials of BENLYSTA administered intravenously,  hypersensitivity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (occurring on the same day of infusion) were reported in 13% (191/1,458) of patients receiving BENLYSTA and 11% (76/675) of patients receiving placebo.  Anaphylaxis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was observed in 0.6% (9/1,458) of patients receiving BENLYSTA and 0.4% (3/675) of patients receiving placebo. Manifestations included  hypotension≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  angioedema≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  urticaria≠B-NonOSE_AE  or other  rash≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  pruritus≠B-NonOSE_AE , and  dyspnea≠B-NonOSE_AE . Due to overlap in signs and symptoms, it was not possible to distinguish between  hypersensitivity≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE  and  infusion≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE  in all cases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]  . Some patients (13%) received premedication, which may have mitigated or masked a  hypersensitivity≠B-NonOSE_AE  response; however, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether premedication diminishes the frequency or severity of  hypersensitivity≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE .

 BENLYSTA for intravenous use should be administered by healthcare providers prepared to manage  anaphylaxis≠B-NonOSE_AE . In the event of a serious reaction, administration of BENLYSTA must be discontinued immediately and appropriate medical therapy administered. Patients should be monitored during and for an appropriate period of time after intravenous administration of BENLYSTA.

  In the controlled trial of BENLYSTA administered subcutaneously (N = 836), systemic  hypersensitivity≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE  were similar to those observed in the intravenous clinical trials.  

 Patients receiving BENLYSTA should be informed of the signs and symptoms of  hypersensitivity≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE  and be instructed to seek immediate medical care should a reaction occur.

    5.4 Infusion Reactions

  In the controlled clinical trials of BENLYSTA administered intravenously,  adverse≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   events≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   associated≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   with≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   the≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infusion≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (occurring on the same day of the infusion) were reported in 17% (251/1,458) of patients receiving BENLYSTA and 15% (99/675) of patients receiving placebo. Serious  infusion≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (excluding  hypersensitivity≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE ) were reported in 0.5% of patients receiving BENLYSTA and 0.4% of patients receiving placebo and included  bradycardia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  myalgia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  headache≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  rash≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  urticaria≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  hypotension≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . The most common  infusion≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (>=3% of patients receiving BENLYSTA) were  headache≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  nausea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  skin≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . Due to overlap in signs and symptoms, it was not possible to distinguish between  hypersensitivity≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE  and  infusion≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE  in all cases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]  . Some patients (13%) received premedication, which may have mitigated or masked an  infusion≠B-NonOSE_AE   reaction≠I-NonOSE_AE ; however, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether premedication diminishes the frequency or severity of  infusion≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE  [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]  .

 BENLYSTA for intravenous use should be administered by healthcare providers prepared to manage  infusion≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE . The infusion rate may be slowed or interrupted if the patient develops an  infusion≠B-NonOSE_AE   reaction≠I-NonOSE_AE . Healthcare providers should be aware of the risk of  hypersensitivity≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE , which may present as  infusion≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE , and monitor patients closely.

    5.5 Depression

  In the controlled clinical trials of BENLYSTA administered intravenously,  psychiatric≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   events≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  were reported more frequently with BENLYSTA (16%) than with placebo (12%), related primarily to  depression≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  related≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   events≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (6.3% BENLYSTA and 4.7% placebo),  insomnia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (6.0% BENLYSTA and 5.3% placebo), and  anxiety≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (3.9% BENLYSTA and 2.8% placebo). Serious  psychiatric≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   events≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  were reported in 0.8% of patients receiving BENLYSTA (0.6% and 1.2% with 1 and 10 mg/kg, respectively) and 0.4% of patients receiving placebo. Serious  depression≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was reported in 0.4% (6/1,458) of patients receiving BENLYSTA and 0.1% (1/675) of patients receiving placebo. Two  suicides≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (0.1%) were reported in patients receiving BENLYSTA.

  In the controlled trial of BENLYSTA administered subcutaneously (N = 836),  psychiatric≠B-NonOSE_AE   events≠I-NonOSE_AE  were reported in 6% of patients treated with BENLYSTA and in 11% of patients who received placebo.  Depression≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  related≠I-NonOSE_AE   events≠I-NonOSE_AE  were reported in 2.7% of patients receiving BENLYSTA and 3.6% of patients receiving placebo. Serious  psychiatric≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   events≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  were reported in 0.2% of patients receiving BENLYSTA and in no patients receiving placebo. There were no serious  depression≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  related≠I-NonOSE_AE   events≠I-NonOSE_AE  or  suicides≠B-NonOSE_AE  reported in either group.  

 The majority of patients who reported serious  depression≠B-NonOSE_AE  or  suicidal≠B-NonOSE_AE   behavior≠I-NonOSE_AE  had a history of  depression≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or other serious  psychiatric≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorders≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and most were receiving psychoactive medications. It is unknown if treatment with BENLYSTA is associated with increased risk for these events.

 Patients receiving BENLYSTA should be instructed to contact their healthcare provider if they experience new or worsening  depression≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  suicidal≠B-NonOSE_AE   thoughts≠I-NonOSE_AE , or other  mood≠B-NonOSE_AE   changes≠I-NonOSE_AE .

    5.6 Malignancy

  The impact of treatment with BENLYSTA on the development of  malignancies≠B-NonOSE_AE  is not known.

  In the controlled clinical trials of BENLYSTA administered intravenously,  malignancies≠B-NonOSE_AE  (including  non≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  melanoma≠I-NonOSE_AE   skin≠I-NonOSE_AE   cancers≠I-NonOSE_AE ) were reported in 0.4% of patients receiving BENLYSTA and 0.4% of patients receiving placebo. In the intravenous controlled clinical trials,  malignancies≠B-NonOSE_AE , excluding  non≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  melanoma≠I-NonOSE_AE   skin≠I-NonOSE_AE   cancers≠I-NonOSE_AE , were observed in 0.2% (3/1,458) and 0.3% (2/675) of patients receiving BENLYSTA and placebo, respectively. In the controlled clinical trial of BENLYSTA administered subcutaneously (N = 836), the data were similar. The mechanism of action of BENLYSTA could increase the risk for the development of  malignancies≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .  

    5.7 Immunization

  Live vaccines should not be given for 30 days before or concurrently with BENLYSTA as clinical safety has not been established. No data are available on the  secondary≠B-NonOSE_AE   transmission≠I-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   infection≠I-NonOSE_AE  from persons receiving live vaccines to patients receiving BENLYSTA or the effect of BENLYSTA on new immunizations. Because of its mechanism of action, BENLYSTA may  interfere≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   with≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   the≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   response≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   to≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   immunizations≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE .

    5.8 Concomitant Use with Other Biologic Therapies or Intravenous Cyclophosphamide

  BENLYSTA has not been studied in combination with other biologic therapies, including B-cell targeted therapies, or intravenous cyclophosphamide. Therefore, use of BENLYSTA is not recommended in combination with biologic therapies or intravenous cyclophosphamide.
