   WARNINGS

  In patients with  hepatic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   cirrhosis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and  ascites≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , furosemide therapy is best initiated in the hospital. In  hepatic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   coma≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and in states of  electrolyte≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depletion≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , therapy should not be instituted until the basic condition is improved. Sudden  alterations≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   fluid≠I-NonOSE_AE  and electrolyte  balance≠I-NonOSE_AE  in patients with  cirrhosis≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  may precipitate  hepatic≠B-NonOSE_AE   coma≠I-NonOSE_AE ; therefore, strict observation is necessary during the period of  diuresis≠B-NonOSE_AE . Supplemental potassium chloride and, if required, an aldosterone antagonist are helpful in preventing  hypokalemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  and  metabolic≠B-NonOSE_AE   alkalosis≠I-NonOSE_AE .

 If increasing  azotemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  and  oliguria≠B-NonOSE_AE  occur during treatment of severe progressive  renal≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , furosemide should be discontinued.

 Cases of  tinnitus≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and reversible or  irreversible≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   hearing≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   impairment≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  deafness≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported. Reports usually indicate that furosemide  ototoxicity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  is associated with rapid injection, severe  renal≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   impairment≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , the use of higher than recommended doses,  hypoproteinemia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , or concomitant therapy with aminoglycoside antibiotics, ethacrynic acid, or other  ototoxic≠B-NonOSE_AE   drugs≠I-NonOSE_AE . If the physician elects to use high dose parenteral therapy, controlled intravenous infusion is advisable (for adults, an infusion rate not exceeding 4 mg furosemide per minute has been used).
