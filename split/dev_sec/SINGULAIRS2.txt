   5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

   EXCERPT:    *  Do not prescribe SINGULAIR to treat an acute asthma attack (  5.1  ). 
 *  Advise patients to have appropriate rescue medication available (  5.1  ). 
 *  Inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually. Do not abruptly substitute SINGULAIR for inhaled or oral corticosteroids (  5.2  ). 
 *  Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue to avoid aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking SINGULAIR (  5.3  ). 
 *  Neuropsychiatric events have been reported with SINGULAIR. Instruct patients to be alert for neuropsychiatric events. Evaluate the risks and benefits of continuing treatment with SINGULAIR if such events occur (  5.4  and  6.2  ). 
 *  Systemic eosinophilia, sometimes presenting with clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome, has been reported. These events have been sometimes associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy (  5.5  and  6.2  ). 
 *  Inform patients with phenylketonuria that the 4-mg and 5-mg chewable tablets contain phenylalanine (  5.6  ). 
    
 

   5.1 Acute Asthma

  SINGULAIR is not indicated for use in the reversal of  bronchospasm≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  in  acute≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   asthma≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   attacks≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , including  status≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   asthmaticus≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with SINGULAIR can be continued during  acute≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   exacerbations≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   of≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   asthma≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Patients who have  exacerbations≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   of≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   asthma≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   after≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   exercise≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  should have available for rescue a short-acting inhaled beta-agonist.

    5.2 Concomitant Corticosteroid Use

  While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, SINGULAIR should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids.

    5.3 Aspirin Sensitivity

  Patients with known  aspirin≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   sensitivity≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking SINGULAIR. Although SINGULAIR is effective in improving airway function in  asthmatics≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  with documented  aspirin≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   sensitivity≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , it has not been shown to truncate  bronchoconstrictor≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   response≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   to≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   aspirin≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in  aspirin≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  sensitive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   asthmatic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  patients [see  Clinical Studies (14.1)  ]  .

    5.4 Neuropsychiatric Events

    Neuropsychiatric≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   events≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported in adult, adolescent, and pediatric patients taking SINGULAIR. Post-marketing reports with SINGULAIR use include  agitation≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  aggressive≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   behavior≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  or  hostility≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  anxiousness≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  depression≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  disorientation≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  disturbance≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   attention≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  dream≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   abnormalities≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  hallucinations≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  insomnia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  irritability≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  memory≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   impairment≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  restlessness≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  somnambulism≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  suicidal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   thinking≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  behavior≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (including  suicide≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ),  tic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  tremor≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . The clinical details of some post-marketing reports involving SINGULAIR appear consistent with a drug-induced effect.  

 Patients and prescribers should be alert for  neuropsychiatric≠B-NonOSE_AE   events≠I-NonOSE_AE . Patients should be instructed to notify their prescriber if these changes occur. Prescribers should carefully evaluate the risks and benefits of continuing treatment with SINGULAIR if such events occur [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ].  

    5.5 Eosinophilic Conditions

  Patients with  asthma≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  on therapy with SINGULAIR may present with  systemic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   eosinophilia≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , sometimes presenting with clinical features of  vasculitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  consistent with  Churg≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  Strauss≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   syndrome≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , a condition which is often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These events have been sometimes associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. Physicians should be alert to  eosinophilia≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  vasculitic≠B-NonOSE_AE   rash≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  worsening≠B-NonOSE_AE   pulmonary≠I-NonOSE_AE   symptoms≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  cardiac≠B-NonOSE_AE   complications≠I-NonOSE_AE , and/or  neuropathy≠B-NonOSE_AE  presenting in their patients. A causal association between SINGULAIR and these underlying conditions has not been established [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ].  

    5.6 Phenylketonuria

   Phenylketonuric≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  patients should be informed that the 4-mg and 5-mg chewable tablets contain phenylalanine (a component of aspartame), 0.674 and 0.842 mg per 4-mg and 5-mg chewable tablet, respectively.
