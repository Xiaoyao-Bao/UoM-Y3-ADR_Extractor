  6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

  Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

 The most common adverse reactions observed in patients receiving Avastin as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy at a rate > 10%, are epistaxis, headache, hypertension, rhinitis, proteinuria, taste alteration, dry skin, rectal hemorrhage, lacrimation disorder, back pain and exfoliative dermatitis.

 The safety data below reflect exposure to Avastin in 2919 patients with mCRC, non-squamous NSCLC, glioblastoma, mRCC, cervical cancer, platinum-resistant or platinum-sensitive recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, including controlled studies (AVF2107g, E3200, E4599, EORTC 26101, BO17705, GOG-0240, MO22224, AVF4095, GOG-0213) at the recommended dose and schedule for a median of 6 to 23 doses.

 Across clinical studies, Avastin was discontinued in 8% to 22% of patients because of adverse reactions  [see  Clinical Studies (14)  ].  

     Platinum  -  Resistant Recurrent Epithelia Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer  

 The safety of Avastin was evaluated in 179 patients who received at least one dose of Avastin in a multicenter, open-label study (MO22224) in which patients were randomized (1:1) to Avastin with chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone in patients with platinum resistant, recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer that recurred within < 6 months from the most recent platinum based therapy. Patients were randomized to receive Avastin (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks). Patients had received no more than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens. The trial excluded patients with evidence of recto-sigmoid involvement by pelvic examination or bowel involvement on CT scan or clinical symptoms of bowel obstruction. Patients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Forty percent of patients on the chemotherapy alone arm received Avastin alone upon progression. The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population. Adverse reactions are presented in  Table 2  .

     Platinum-Sensitive Recurrent Epithelial Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer  

 The safety of Avastin was evaluated in 247 patients who received at least one dose of Avastin in a double-blind study (AVF4095g) in patients with platinum sensitive recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive Avastin (15 mg/kg) or placebo every 3 weeks with carboplatin and gemcitabine for 6 to 10 cycles followed by Avastin or placebo alone until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population. Adverse reactions are presented in  Table 3  .

     Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (mRCC)  

 The safety of Avastin was evaluated in 337 patients who received at least one dose of Avastin in a multicenter, double-blind study (BO17705) in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Patients who had undergone a nephrectomy were randomized (1:1) to receive either Avastin (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks) or placebo with interferon alfa. Patients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population.

 Grade 3-5 adverse reactions occurring at a higher incidence ( >2%) were fatigue (13% vs. 8%), asthenia (10% vs. 7%), proteinuria (7% vs. 0%), hypertension (6% vs. 1%; including hypertension and hypertensive crisis), and hemorrhage (3% vs. 0.3%; including epistaxis, small intestinal hemorrhage, aneurysm ruptured, gastric ulcer hemorrhage, gingival bleeding, hemoptysis, hemorrhage intracranial, large intestinal hemorrhage, respiratory tract hemorrhage, and traumatic hematoma). Adverse reactions are presented in  Table 5  .

     Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (mCRC)  

 The safety of Avastin was evaluated in 392 patients who received at least one dose of Avastin in a double-blind, active-controlled study (AVF2107g), which compared Avastin (5 mg/kg every 2 weeks) with bolus-IFL to placebo with bolus IFL in patients with mCRC. Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to placebo with bolus IFL, Avastin with bolus IFL, or Avastin with 5 fluorouracil and leucovorin. The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population.

 All Grade 3-4 adverse reactions and selected Grade 1-2 adverse reactions (i.e., hypertension, proteinuria, thromboembolic events) were collected in the entire study population. Adverse reactions are presented in  Table 7  .

         The safety of Avastin was evaluated in 521 patients in an open-label, active-controlled study (E3200). Patients who were previously treated with irinotecan and fluorouracil for initial therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer. Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to FOLFOX4, Avastin (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks prior to FOLFOX4 on Day 1) with FOLFOX4, or Avastin alone (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks). Avastin was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
 

 The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population. The most frequent adverse reactions (selected Grade 3-5 non-hematologic and Grade 4-5 hematologic) occurring at a higher incidence (>= 2%) in patients receiving Avastin with FOLFOX4 compared to FOLFOX4 alone were fatigue (19% vs. 13%), diarrhea (18% vs. 13%), sensory neuropathy (17% vs. 9%), nausea (12% vs. 5%), vomiting (11% vs. 4%), dehydration (10% vs. 5%), hypertension (9% vs. 2%), abdominal pain (8% vs. 5%), hemorrhage (5% vs. 1%), other neurological (5% vs. 3%), ileus (4% vs. 1%) and headache (3% vs. 0%). These data are likely to under-estimate the true adverse event rates due to the reporting mechanisms.

     First-Line Non Squamous Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)  

 The safety of Avastin was evaluated as first-line treatment in 422 patients with unresectable NSCLC who received at least one dose of Avastin in an active-controlled, open-label, multicenter trial (E4599). Chemotherapy naive patients with locally advanced, metastatic or recurrent non-squamous NSCLC were randomized (1:1) to receive six 21 day cycles of paclitaxel and carboplatin with or without Avastin (15 mg/kg every 3 weeks). After completion or upon discontinuation of chemotherapy, patients randomized to receive Avastin continued to receive Avastin alone until disease progression or until unacceptable toxicity. The trial excluded patients with predominant squamous histology (mixed cell type tumors only), CNS metastasis, gross hemoptysis (1/2 teaspoon or more of red blood), unstable angina, or receiving therapeutic anticoagulation. The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population.

 Only Grade 3-5 non hematologic and Grade 4-5 hematologic adverse reactions were collected. Grade 3-5 non hematologic and Grade 4-5 hematologic adverse reactions occurring at a higher incidence (>= 2%) in patients receiving Avastin with paclitaxel and carboplatin compared with patients receiving chemotherapy alone were neutropenia (27% vs. 17%), fatigue (16% vs. 13%), hypertension (8% vs. 0.7%), infection without neutropenia (7% vs. 3%), venous thromboembolism (5% vs. 3%), febrile neutropenia (5% vs. 2%), pneumonitis/pulmonary infiltrates (5% vs. 3%), infection with Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (4% vs. 2%), hyponatremia (4% vs. 1%), headache (3% vs. 1%) and proteinuria (3% vs. 0%).

     Recurrent Glioblastoma  

 EORTC 26101 was a multicenter, randomized, open-label study in patients with recurrent GBM following radiotherapy and temozolomide of whom 278 patients received at least one dose of Avastin and are considered safety evaluable. Patients were randomized (2:1) to receive Avastin (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks) with lomustine or lomustine alone until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population. In the Avastin with lomustine arm, 22% of patients discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions compared with 10% of patients in the lomustine arm. In patients receiving Avastin with lomustine, the adverse reaction profile was similar to that observed in other approved indications.

   6.2 Immunogenicity

  As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to bevacizumab in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading.

 In clinical studies for adjuvant treatment of a solid tumor, 0.6% (14/2323) of patients tested positive for treatment-emergent anti-bevacizumab antibodies as detected by an electrochemiluminescent (ECL) based assay. Among these 14 patients, three tested positive for neutralizing antibodies against bevacizumab using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The clinical significance of these anti-bevacizumab antibodies is not known.

   6.3 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Avastin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

   Body as a Whole:  Polyserositis  Cardiovascular:  Pulmonary hypertension, Mesenteric venous occlusion  Gastrointestinal:  Gastrointestinal ulcer, Intestinal necrosis, Anastomotic ulceration  Hemic and lymphatic:  Pancytopenia  Hepatobiliary disorders:  Gallbladder perforation  Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders:  Osteonecrosis of the jaw  Renal:  Renal thrombotic microangiopathy (manifested as severe proteinuria)  Respiratory:  Nasal septum perforation
