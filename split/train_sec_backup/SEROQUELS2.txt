  WARNING:  INCREASED MORTALITY IN ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH DEMENTIA-RELATED PSYCHOSIS; and SUICIDAL THOUGHTS AND BEHAVIORS

      Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis    

   Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ].   SEROQUEL is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ].  

     Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors    

   Antidepressants increased the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior in children, adolescents, and young adults in short-term studies. These studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior with antidepressant use in patients over age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressant use in patients aged 65 and older   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ].     

   In patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy, monitor closely for worsening, and for emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors.  Advise families and caregivers of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber [  see   Warnings and Precautions (5.2)    ].  

   SEROQUEL is not approved for use in pediatric patients under ten years of age   [see   Use in Specific Populations (8.4)  ].
