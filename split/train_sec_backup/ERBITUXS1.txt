  6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

  The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label:

 *    Infusion reactions [See   Boxed Warning  ,  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)   .] 
 *    Cardiopulmonary arrest [See   Boxed Warning  ,  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)   .] 
 *    Pulmonary toxicity [See   Warnings and Precautions (5.3)   .] 
 *    Dermatologic toxicity [See   Warnings and Precautions (5.4)   .] 
 *    Hypomagnesemia and Electrolyte Abnormalities [See   Warnings and Precautions (5.6)   .] 
    The most common adverse reactions in Erbitux clinical trials (incidence >=25%) include cutaneous adverse reactions (including rash, pruritus, and nail changes), headache, diarrhea, and infection.
 

 The most serious adverse reactions with Erbitux are infusion reactions, cardiopulmonary arrest, dermatologic toxicity and radiation dermatitis, sepsis, renal failure, interstitial lung disease, and pulmonary embolus.

 Across Studies 1, 3, 5, and 6, Erbitux was discontinued in 3-10% of patients because of adverse reactions.

   EXCERPT:   The most common adverse reactions (incidence >=25%) are: cutaneous adverse reactions (including rash, pruritus, and nail changes), headache, diarrhea, and infection.  (6)

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

 The data below reflect exposure to Erbitux in 1373 patients with SCCHN or colorectal cancer in randomized Phase 3 (Studies 1 and 5) or Phase 2 (Studies 3 and 6) trials treated at the recommended dose and schedule for medians of 7 to 14 weeks. [See    Clinical Studies (14)    .]

   Infusion reactions:  Infusion reactions, which included pyrexia, chills, rigors, dyspnea, bronchospasm, angioedema, urticaria, hypertension, and hypotension occurred in 15-21% of patients across studies. Grades 3 and 4 infusion reactions occurred in 2-5% of patients; infusion reactions were fatal in 1 patient.

   Infections:  The incidence of infection was variable across studies, ranging from 13-35%. Sepsis occurred in 1-4% of patients.

   Renal:  Renal failure occurred in 1% of patients with colorectal cancer.

    Erbitux in Combination with Radiation Therapy  

    Table 2  contains selected adverse reactions in 420 patients receiving radiation therapy either alone or with Erbitux for locally or regionally advanced SCCHN in Study 1. Erbitux was administered at the recommended dose and schedule (400 mg/m  2  initial dose, followed by 250 mg/m  2  weekly). Patients received a median of 8 infusions (range 1-11).

           The incidence and severity of mucositis, stomatitis, and xerostomia were similar in both arms of the study.
 

     Late Radiation Toxicity  

  The overall incidence of late radiation toxicities (any grade) was higher in Erbitux in combination with radiation therapy compared with radiation therapy alone. The following sites were affected: salivary glands (65% versus 56%), larynx (52% versus 36%), subcutaneous tissue (49% versus 45%), mucous membrane (48% versus 39%), esophagus (44% versus 35%), skin (42% versus 33%). The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 late radiation toxicities was similar between the radiation therapy alone and the Erbitux plus radiation treatment groups.

     Study 2: EU-Approved Cetuximab in Combination with Platinum-based Therapy with 5-Fluorouracil  

  Study 2 used EU-approved cetuximab. Since U.S.-licensed Erbitux provides approximately 22% higher exposure relative to the EU-approved cetuximab, the data provided below may underestimate the incidence and severity of adverse reactions anticipated with Erbitux for this indication. However, the tolerability of the recommended dose is supported by safety data from additional studies of Erbitux [see    Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)    ].

   Table 3  contains selected adverse reactions in 434 patients with recurrent locoregional disease or metastatic SCCHN receiving EU-approved cetuximab in combination with platinum-based therapy with 5-FU or platinum-based therapy with 5-FU alone in Study 2. Cetuximab was administered at 400 mg/m  2  for the initial dose, followed by 250 mg/m  2  weekly. Patients received a median of 17 infusions (range 1-89).

           For cardiac disorders, approximately 9% of subjects in both the EU-approved cetuximab plus chemotherapy and chemotherapy-only treatment arms in Study 2 experienced a cardiac event. The majority of these events occurred in patients who received cisplatin/5-FU, with or without cetuximab as follows: 11% and 12% in patients who received cisplatin/5-FU with or without cetuximab, respectively, and 6% or 4% in patients who received carboplatin/5-FU with or without cetuximab, respectively. In both arms, the incidence of cardiovascular events was higher in the cisplatin with 5-FU containing subgroup. Death attributed to cardiovascular event or sudden death was reported in 3% of the patients in the cetuximab plus platinum-based therapy with 5-FU arm and 2% in the platinum-based chemotherapy with 5-FU alone arm.
 

     Colorectal Cancer  

    Study 4: EU-Approved Cetuximab in Combination with FOLFIRI  

  Study 4 used EU-approved cetuximab. U.S.-licensed Erbitux provides approximately 22% higher exposure to cetuximab relative to the EU-approved cetuximab. The data provided below for Study 4 is consistent in incidence and severity of adverse reactions with those seen for Erbitux in this indication. The tolerability of the recommended dose is supported by safety data from additional studies of Erbitux [see    Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)    ].

   Table 4  contains selected adverse reactions in 667 patients with  K-Ras  wild-type, EGFR-expressing, metastatic colorectal cancer receiving EU-approved cetuximab plus FOLFIRI or FOLFIRI alone in Study 4 [see    Warnings and Precautions (5.8)    ]. Cetuximab was administered at the recommended dose and schedule (400 mg/m  2  initial dose, followed by 250 mg/m  2  weekly). Patients received a median of 26 infusions (range 1-224).

Erbitux was administered at the recommended dose and schedule (400 mg/m  2  initial dose, followed by 250 mg/m  2  weekly). Patients received a median of 17 infusions (range 1-51).

               Erbitux in Combination with Irinotecan  
   The most frequently reported adverse reactions in 354 patients treated with Erbitux plus irinotecan in clinical trials were acneiform rash (88%), asthenia/malaise (73%), diarrhea (72%), and nausea (55%). The most common Grades 3-4 adverse reactions included diarrhea (22%), leukopenia (17%), asthenia/malaise (16%), and acneiform rash (14%).

   6.2 Immunogenicity

  As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. An ELISA methodology was used to characterize the incidence of anti-cetuximab antibodies. In total, 105 Erbitux-treated patients with at least one post-baseline blood sample (>=4 weeks post first administration) were assessed for the development of anti-cetuximab binding antibodies and the incidence of treatment-emergent anti-cetuximab binding antibodies was <5%.

 The incidence of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to Erbitux with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.

   6.3 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Erbitux. Because these reactions are reported from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

 *    Aseptic meningitis 
 *    Mucosal inflammation 
 *    Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, life-threatening and fatal bullous mucocutaneous disease
