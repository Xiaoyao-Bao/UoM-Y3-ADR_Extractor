  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

 Most patients taking thalidomide can be expected to experience adverse reactions.

   Teratogenicity:  

 The most serious toxicity associated with thalidomide is its documented human teratogenicity. The risk of severe birth defects, primarily phocomelia or death to the fetus, is extremely high during the critical period of pregnancy. The critical period is estimated, depending on the source of information, to range from 35 to 50 days after the last menstrual period. The risk of other potentially severe birth defects outside this critical period is unknown, but may be significant. Based on present knowledge, thalidomide must not be used at any time during pregnancy.

 Because thalidomide is present in the semen of patients receiving the drug, males receiving thalidomide must always use a latex or synthetic condom during any sexual contact with females of reproductive potential, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy.

   Venous and Arterial Thromboembolism:  

 An increased risk of venous thromboembolism (such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism), ischemic heart disease (including myocardial infarction), and stroke have been reported in patients with multiple myeloma treated with thalidomide  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  .

   Peripheral Neuropathy:  

 Peripheral neuropathy is a very common, potentially severe, adverse reaction of treatment with thalidomide that may result in irreversible damage.  Peripheral neuropathy generally occurs following chronic use over a period of months. However, reports following relatively short-term use also exist. Incidence of neuropathy events leading to discontinuation, dose reduction or interruption increases with cumulative dose and duration of therapy.  Symptoms may occur some time after thalidomide treatment has been stopped and may resolve slowly or not at all.

 Somnolence, dizziness, and rash are the most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of thalidomide. Adverse event profiles from clinical trials are summarized in the sections that follow.

   Adverse Reactions in Multiple Myeloma Controlled Clinical Trials  

 The safety analyses were conducted in two controlled clinical studies (Study 1 and Study 2).  The safety analysis in Study 1 was conducted on 204 patients who received treatment.  Table 1  lists the most common adverse drug reactions (>= 10%). The most frequently reported adverse reactions were fatigue, hypocalcemia, edema, constipation, sensory neuropathy, dyspnea, muscle weakness, leukopenia, neutropenia, rash/desquamation, confusion, anorexia, nausea, anxiety/agitation, tremor, fever, weight loss, thrombosis/embolism, neuropathy-motor, weight gain, dizziness, and dry skin.

 Twenty-three percent of patients (47/204) discontinued due to adverse reactions; 30% (31/102) from the THALOMID/dexamethasone arm and 16% (16/102) from the dexamethasone alone arm.

      The safety analysis in Study 2 was conducted on 466 patients who received treatment.  Table 2  lists the most common adverse drug reactions (>= 10%) that were observed.  Table 3  lists the most common Grade 3/4 adverse drug reactions (occurring at > 2%) that were observed. The adverse reactions most often reported by patients treated with THALOMID/dexamethasone were constipation, peripheral edema, tremor, asthenia, dizziness and fatigue. Adverse reactions with a frequency at least 2-fold higher in the THALOMID/dexamethasone group than in the placebo/dexamethasone group include constipation, tremor, deep vein thrombosis and peripheral sensory neuropathy.
 

 Twenty-six percent of patients (121/466) discontinued due to adverse events; 37% (86/234) from the THALOMID/dexamethasone arm and 15% (35/232) from the placebo/dexamethasone arm.

        Less Common Adverse Drug Reactions in Multiple Myeloma Controlled Clinical Trials  
 

 In Study 2, THALOMID in combination with dexamethasone in patients with multiple myeloma, the following adverse drug reactions not described above were reported*:

   Gastrointestinal disorders:  Vomiting NOS, dry mouth, peritonitis, diverticular perforation

   Nervous system disorders:  Somnolence, hypoesthesia, polyneuropathy NOS, transient ischemic attack

   Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders:  Bronchitis NOS

   Psychiatric disorders:  Mood alteration NOS

   Vascular disorders:  Hypotension NOS, orthostatic hypotension

   Cardiac disorders:  Bradycardia NOS

   Eye disorders:  Blurred vision

 * All adverse reactions with >=3% of patients in THALOMID/dexamethasone arm and with a >=1% difference in proportion of patients between the THALOMID/dexamethasone arm compared to the placebo/dexamethasone arm. All grade 3/4 and serious adverse reactions reported >2 patients in THALOMID/dexamethasone arm and with a percentage higher in the THALOMID/dexamethasone arm compared to the placebo/dexamethasone arm have been considered for possible inclusion. In any cases medical judgment has been applied for consideration of causality assessment.

   Adverse Reactions in Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL) Clinical Trials  

   Table 4  lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in THALOMID-treated patients in clinical trials in ENL. The most common adverse reactions (>=10%) reported in patients with ENL were somnolence, rash, headache. Doses ranged from 50 to 300 mg/day. All adverse reactions were mild to moderate in severity, and none resulted in discontinuation.

        Other Adverse Events Observed in ENL Patients  
 

 THALOMID in doses up to 400 mg/day has been administered investigationally in the United States over a 19-year period in 1465 patients with ENL. The published literature describes the treatment of an additional 1678 patients. To provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of the individuals having adverse events, similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary/terminology. These categories are used in the listing below. All reported events are included except those already listed in the previous table. Due to the fact that these data were collected from uncontrolled studies, the incidence rate cannot be determined. No causal relationship between THALOMID and these events can be conclusively determined at this time. These are reports of all adverse events noted by investigators in patients to whom they had administered thalidomide.

   Other Adverse Events Observed in HIV-seropositive Patients  

 In addition to controlled clinical trials, THALOMID has been used in uncontrolled studies in 145 patients. Less frequent adverse events that have been reported in these HIV-seropositive patients treated with THALOMID were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using modified COSTART dictionary/terminology and these categories are used in the listing below. Adverse events that have already been included in the tables and narrative above, or that are too general to be informative are not listed.

   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of THALOMID and are not already included in Clinical Trials Experience  [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
