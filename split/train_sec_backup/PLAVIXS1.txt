  6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

  The following serious adverse reactions are discussed below and elsewhere in the labeling:

 *  Bleeding [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]  
 *  Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.4)  ]  
      EXCERPT:   Bleeding, including life-threatening and fatal bleeding, is the most commonly reported adverse reaction. (  6.1  )

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions and durations of follow-up, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

 Plavix has been evaluated for safety in more than 54,000 patients, including over 21,000 patients treated for one year or more. The clinically important adverse reactions observed in trials comparing Plavix plus aspirin to placebo plus aspirin and trials comparing Plavix alone to aspirin alone are discussed below.

     Bleeding  

   CURE

 In CURE, Plavix use with aspirin was associated with an increase in major bleeding (primarily gastrointestinal and at puncture sites) compared to placebo with aspirin (see  Table 1  ). The incidence of intracranial hemorrhage (0.1%) and fatal bleeding (0.2%) were the same in both groups. Other bleeding events that were reported more frequently in the clopidogrel group were epistaxis, hematuria, and bruise.

 The overall incidence of bleeding is described in Table 1.

           COMMIT
 

 In COMMIT, similar rates of major bleeding were observed in the Plavix and placebo groups, both of which also received aspirin (see  Table 2  ).

            CAPRIE (Plavix vs Aspirin)
 

 In CAPRIE, gastrointestinal hemorrhage occurred at a rate of 2.0% in those taking Plavix versus 2.7% in those taking aspirin; bleeding requiring hospitalization occurred in 0.7% and 1.1%, respectively. The incidence of intracranial hemorrhage was 0.4% for Plavix compared to 0.5% for aspirin.

 Other bleeding events that were reported more frequently in the Plavix group were epistaxis and hematoma.

     Other Adverse Events  

 In CURE and CHARISMA, which compared Plavix plus aspirin to aspirin alone, there was no difference in the rate of adverse events (other than bleeding) between Plavix and placebo.

 In CAPRIE, which compared Plavix to aspirin, pruritus was more frequently reported in those taking Plavix. No other difference in the rate of adverse events (other than bleeding) was reported.

   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Plavix. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of an unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

 Hemorrhages, including those with fatal outcome, have been reported in patients treated with Plavix.
