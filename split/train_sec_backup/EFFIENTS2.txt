    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: BLEEDING RISK 

  WARNING: BLEEDING RISK 

    *  Effient can cause significant, sometimes fatal, bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 
 *  Do not use Effient in patients with active pathological bleeding or a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke [see Contraindications (4.1, 4.2)]. 
 *  In patients >=75 years of age, Effient is generally not recommended, because of the increased risk of fatal and intracranial bleeding and uncertain benefit, except in high-risk situations (patients with diabetes or a history of prior MI) where its effect appears to be greater and its use may be considered [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. 
 *  Do not start Effient in patients likely to undergo urgent coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). When possible, discontinue Effient at least 7 days prior to any surgery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 
 *  Additional risk factors for bleeding include: body weight <60 kg; propensity to bleed; concomitant use of medications that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., warfarin, heparin, fibrinolytic therapy, chronic use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 
 *  Suspect bleeding in any patient who is hypotensive and has recently undergone coronary angiography, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), CABG, or other surgical procedures in the setting of Effient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 
 *  If possible, manage bleeding without discontinuing Effient. Discontinuing Effient, particularly in the first few weeks after acute coronary syndrome, increases the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].
