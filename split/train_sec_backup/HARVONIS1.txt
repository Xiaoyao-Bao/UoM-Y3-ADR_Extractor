    6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

  EXCERPT:   The most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 10%, all grades) observed with treatment with HARVONI for 8, 12, or 24 weeks are fatigue and headache (  6.1  )

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The safety assessment of HARVONI was based on pooled data from three Phase 3 clinical trials of subjects with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C (CHC) with compensated liver disease (with and without cirrhosis) including 215, 539, and 326 subjects who received HARVONI for 8, 12 and 24 weeks, respectively  [see  Clinical Studies (14)  ].  



 The proportion of subjects who permanently discontinued treatment due to adverse events was 0%, <1%, and 1% for subjects receiving HARVONI for 8, 12, and 24 weeks, respectively.



 The most common adverse reactions (>=10%) were fatigue and headache in subjects treated with 8, 12, or 24 weeks of HARVONI.



 Table 2 lists adverse reactions (adverse events assessed as causally related by the investigator, all grades) observed in >=5% of subjects receiving 8, 12, or 24 weeks treatment with HARVONI in clinical trials. The majority of adverse reactions presented in Table 2 occurred at severity of grade 1. The side-by-side tabulation is to simplify presentation; direct comparison across trials should not be made due to differing trial designs.

              Laboratory Abnormalities  
 

     Bilirubin Elevations:  Bilirubin elevations of greater than 1.5*ULN were observed in 3%, <1%, and 2% of subjects treated with HARVONI for 8, 12, and 24 weeks, respectively.



     Lipase Elevations:  Transient, asymptomatic lipase elevations of greater than 3*ULN were observed in <1%, 2%, and 3% of subjects treated with HARVONI for 8, 12, and 24 weeks, respectively.



     Creatine Kinase:  Creatine kinase was not assessed in Phase 3 trials of HARVONI. Isolated, asymptomatic creatine kinase elevations (Grade 3 or 4) have been previously reported in subjects treated with sofosbuvir in combination with ribavirin or peginterferon/ribavirin in other clinical trials.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of HARVONI. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



     Cardiac Disorders  



 Serious symptomatic bradycardia has been reported in patients taking amiodarone who initiate treatment with HARVONI  [See  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ,  Drug Interactions (7.2)  ]
