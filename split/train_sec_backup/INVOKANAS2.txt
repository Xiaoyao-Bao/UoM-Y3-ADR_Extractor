    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: LOWER LIMB AMPUTATION

    WARNING: LOWER LIMB AMPUTATION  

    *  An approximately 2-fold increased risk of lower limb amputations associated with INVOKANA use was observed in CANVAS and CANVAS-R, two large, randomized, placebo-controlled trials in patients with type 2 diabetes who had established cardiovascular disease (CVD) or were at risk for CVD. 
 *  Amputations of the toe and midfoot were most frequent; however, amputations involving the leg were also observed. Some patients had multiple amputations, some involving both limbs. 
 *  Before initiating, consider factors that may increase the risk of amputation, such as a history of prior amputation, peripheral vascular disease, neuropathy, and diabetic foot ulcers. 
 *  Monitor patients receiving INVOKANA for infection, new pain or tenderness, sores or ulcers involving the lower limbs, and discontinue if these complications occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
