   5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

   EXCERPT:    *  Serious cases of dysphagia, bowel obstruction, and perforation have been associated with sevelamer use, some requiring hospitalization and surgery. (  5.1  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Events

  Cases of dysphagia and esophageal tablet retention have been reported in association with use of the tablet formulation of sevelamer, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. Consider using sevelamer suspension in patients with a history of swallowing disorders.

 Cases of bowel obstruction and perforation have also been reported with sevelamer use.

 Patients with dysphagia, swallowing disorders, severe gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders, including severe constipation, or major GI tract surgery were not included in the Renvela clinical studies.

    5.2 Reductions in Vitamins D, E, K (clotting factors) and Folic Acid Levels

  In preclinical studies in rats and dogs, sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, reduced vitamins D, E, and K (coagulation parameters) and folic acid levels at doses of 6-10 times the recommended human dose. In short-term clinical trials, there was no evidence of reduction in serum levels of vitamins. However, in a one-year clinical trial, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (normal range 10 to 55 ng/mL) fell from 39 +/- 22 ng/mL to 34 +/- 22 ng/mL (p<0.01) with sevelamer hydrochloride treatment. Most (approximately 75%) patients in sevelamer hydrochloride clinical trials were receiving vitamin supplements.
