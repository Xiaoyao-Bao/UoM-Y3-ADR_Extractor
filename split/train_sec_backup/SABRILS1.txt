    6.1          Clinical Trial    Experience  

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     Adverse    Reactions    in U    .    S    .    and Primary Non-U    .    S    .    Clinical Studies    In U.S. and primary non-U.S. clinical studies of 4,079 SABRIL treated patients, the most commonly observed (>=5%) adverse reactions associated with the use of SABRIL in combination with other AEDs were headache, somnolence, fatigue, dizziness, convulsion, nasopharyngitis, weight increased, upper respiratory tract infection, visual field defect, depression, tremor, nystagmus, nausea, diarrhea, memory impairment, insomnia, irritability, coordination abnormal, vision blurred, diplopia, vomiting, influenza, pyrexia, and rash.



 The adverse reactions most commonly associated with SABRIL treatment discontinuation in >=1% of patients were convulsion and depression.



 In patients with infantile spasms, the adverse reactions most commonly associated with SABRIL treatment discontinuation in >=1% of patients were infections, status epilepticus, developmental coordination disorder, dystonia, hypotonia, hypertonia, weight increased, and insomnia.

             Infantile Spasms    In a randomized, placebo-controlled IS study with a 5 day double-blind treatment phase (n=40), the adverse events reported by >5% of patients receiving SABRIL and that occurred more frequently than in placebo patients, were somnolence (SABRIL 45%,   placebo  30%), bronchitis (SABRIL 30%,  placebo  15%), ear infection (SABRIL 10%,   placebo  5%), and otitis media acute SABRIL 10%,   placebo  0%).
 

 In a dose response study of low-dose (18-36 mg/kg/day) versus high-dose (100-148 mg/kg/day) vigabatrin, no clear correlation between dose and incidence of adverse events was observed. The treatment emergent adverse reactions (>=5% in either dose group) are summarized in Table 7.

   The following adverse reactions have been reported during post approval use of SABRIL worldwide. All adverse reactions that are not listed above as adverse reactions reported in clinical trials, that are not relatively common in the population and are not too vague to be useful are listed in this section. These reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size; therefore, it is not possible to estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions are categorized by system organ class.
