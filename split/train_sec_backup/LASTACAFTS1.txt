    6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



   EXCERPT:   The most common ocular adverse reactions, occurring in less than 4% of eyes treated with LASTACAFT  (r)  , were eye irritation, burning and/or stinging on instillation, eye redness, and eye pruritus. (  6.1  )
