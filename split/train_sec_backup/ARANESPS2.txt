    WARNING: ESAs INCREASE THE RISK OF DEATH, MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, STROKE, VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM, THROMBOSIS OF VASCULAR ACCESS     AND    TUMOR PROGRESSION OR RECURRENCE  

    Chronic Kidney Disease:  

 *  In controlled trials, patients experienced greater risks for death, serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, and stroke when administered erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) to target a hemoglobin level of greater than 11 g/dL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 
 *  No trial has identified a hemoglobin target level, Aranesp dose, or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 
 *  Use the lowest Aranesp dose sufficient to reduce the need for red blood cell (RBC) transfusions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 
      Cancer:  
 

 *  ESAs shortened overall survival and/or increased the risk of tumor progression or recurrence in clinical studies of patients with breast, non-small cell lung, head and neck, lymphoid, and cervical cancers [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 
 *  To decrease these risks, as well as the risk of serious cardiovascular and thromboembolic reactions, use the lowest dose needed to avoid RBC transfusions [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. 
 *  Use ESAs only for anemia from myelosuppressive chemotherapy [see Indications and Usage (1.2)]. 
 *  ESAs are not indicated for patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy when the anticipated outcome is cure [see Indications and Usage (1.3)]. 
 *  Discontinue following the completion of a chemotherapy course [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. 
      EXCERPT:     WARNING:     ESAs INCREASE THE RISK OF DEATH, MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, STROKE, VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM, THROMBOSIS OF VASCULAR ACCESS     AND    TUMOR PROGRESSION OR RECURRENCE
