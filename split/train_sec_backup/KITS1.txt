  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 In open label, single arm clinical trials, 553 patients with either breast cancer, malanoma, or squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, skin, and lip received Lymphoseek.  No patients experienced serious adverse reactions.  Injection site irritation (4 patients; 0.7%) and pain (1 patient; 0.2%) were reported.
