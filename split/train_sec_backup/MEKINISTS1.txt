  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The data described in the Warnings and Precautions section and below reflect exposure to MEKINIST as a single agent and in combination with dabrafenib. MEKINIST as a single agent was evaluated in 329 patients including 107 (33%) exposed for greater than or equal to 6 months and 30 (9%) exposed for greater than or equal to one year. MEKINIST as a single agent was studied in open-label, single-arm trials (N = 118) or in an open-label, randomized, active-controlled trial (N = 211). The median age was 54 years, 60% were male, >99% were white, and all patients had metastatic melanoma. All patients received 2 mg once-daily doses of MEKINIST. The incidence of RPED and RVO are obtained from the 1,749 patients from all clinical trials with MEKINIST.



 The safety of MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib was evaluated in Trial 2 and other trials consisting of 202 patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma who received MEKINIST 2 mg orally once daily in combination with dabrafenib 150 mg orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Among these 202 patients, 68 (34%) were exposed to MEKINIST and 66 (33%) were exposed to dabrafenib for greater than 6 to 12 months while 36 (18%) were exposed to MEKINIST and 40 (20%) were exposed to dabrafenib for greater than one year. The median age was 54 years, 57% were male and >99% were white.



 Table 3 presents adverse reactions identified from analyses of Trial 1, a randomized, open-label trial of patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive melanoma receiving MEKINIST (N = 211) 2 mg orally once daily or chemotherapy (N = 99) (either dacarbazine 1,000 mg/m  2  every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 175 mg/m  2  every 3 weeks)  [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]  . Patients with abnormal LVEF, history of acute coronary syndrome within 6 months, or current evidence of Class II or greater congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association) were excluded from Trial 1. The median duration of treatment with MEKINIST was 4.3 months. In Trial 1, 9% of patients receiving MEKINIST experienced adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of trial medication. The most common adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of MEKINIST were decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), pneumonitis, renal failure, diarrhea, and rash. Adverse reactions led to dose reductions in 27% of patients treated with MEKINIST. Rash and decreased LVEF were the most common reasons cited for dose reductions of MEKINIST.

    Table 5 presents adverse reactions from Trial 2, a multicenter, open-label, randomized trial of 162 patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive melanoma receiving MEKINIST 2 mg once daily in combination with dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily (N = 55), MEKINIST 1 mg once daily in combination with dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily (N = 54), and dabrafenib as a single agent 150 mg twice daily (N = 53)  [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]  . Patients with abnormal LVEF, history of acute coronary syndrome within 6 months, current evidence of Class II or greater congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association), history of RVO, or RPED, QTc interval >=480 msec, treatment refractory hypertension, uncontrolled arrhythmias, history of pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease, or a known history of G6PD deficiency were excluded. The median duration of treatment was 10.9 months for both MEKINIST (2-mg once-daily treatment group) and dabrafenib when used in combination, 10.6 months for both MEKINIST (1-mg once-daily treatment group) and dabrafenib when used in combination, and 6.1 months for dabrafenib as a single agent.
 

 In Trial 2, 13% of patients receiving MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib at the recommended dose experienced adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of trial medication(s). The most common adverse reaction resulting in permanent discontinuation was pyrexia (4%). Adverse reactions led to dose reductions in 49% and dose interruptions in 67% of patients treated with MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib. Pyrexia, chills, and nausea were the most common reasons cited for dose reductions, and pyrexia, chills, and decreased ejection fraction were the most common reasons cited for dose interruptions of MEKINIST and dabrafenib when used in combination.

      QT Prolongation:  In Trial 2, QTcF prolongation to >500 msec occurred in 4% (2/55) of patients treated with MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib and in 2% (1/53) of patients treated with dabrafenib as a single agent. The QTcF was increased more than 60 msec from baseline in 13% (7/55) of patients treated with MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib and 2% (1/53) of patients treated with dabrafenib as a single agent.
