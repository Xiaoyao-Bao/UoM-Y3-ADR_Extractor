   5.1 Anaphylaxis



   Severe allergic reactions have been reported following polidocanol use, including anaphylactic reactions, some of them fatal. Severe reactions are more frequent with use of larger volumes (> 3 mL). The dose of polidocanol should therefore be minimized. Be prepared to treat anaphylaxis appropriately.  



 Severe adverse local effects, including tissue necrosis, may occur following extravasation; therefore, care should be taken in intravenous needle placement and the smallest effective volume at each injection site should be used.



 After the injection session is completed, apply compression with a stocking or bandage, and have the patient walk for 15-20 minutes. Keep the patient under supervision during this period to treat any anaphylactic or allergic reaction (see  Dosage and Administration [2]  )  .



    5.2 Accidental Intra-arterial Injection



  Intra-arterial injection can cause severe necrosis, ischemia or gangrene. If this occurs consult a vascular surgeon immediately.



    5.3 Inadvertent Perivascular Injection



  Inadvertent perivascular injection of Asclera can cause pain. If pain is severe, a local anesthetic (without adrenaline) may be injected.
