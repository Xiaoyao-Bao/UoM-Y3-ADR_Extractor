  6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

  The following are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling:

 *  Increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis [see    Boxed Warning    and    Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  
 *  Cerebrovascular adverse events, including stroke, in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis [see    Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]  
 *  Neuroleptic malignant syndrome [see    Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  
 *  Tardive dyskinesia [see    Warnings and Precautions (5.4)  ]  
 *  Metabolic Changes (Hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus, Dyslipidemia, and Weight Gain) [see    Warnings and Precautions (5.5)  ]  
 *  Hyperprolactinemia [see    Warnings and Precautions (5.6)  ]  
 *  Orthostatic hypotension [see    Warnings and Precautions (5.7)  ]  
 *  Falls [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.8)  ]  
 *  Leukopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.9)  ]  
 *  Potential for cognitive and motor impairment [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.10)  ]  
 *  Seizures [see    Warnings and Precautions (5.11)  ]  
 *  Dysphagia [see    Warnings and Precautions (5.12)  ]  
 *  Priapism [see    Warnings and Precautions (5.13)  ]  
 *  Disruption of body temperature regulation [see    Warnings and Precautions (5.14)  ]  
 *  Patients with Phenylketonuria [see    Warnings and Precautions (5.15)  ].  
    The most common adverse reactions in clinical trials (>5% and twice placebo) were parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia, tremor, sedation, dizziness, anxiety, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, upper abdominal pain, stomach discomfort, dyspepsia, diarrhea, salivary hypersecretion, constipation, dry mouth, increased appetite, increased weight, fatigue, rash, nasal congestion, upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, and pharyngolaryngeal pain.
 

 The most common adverse reactions that were associated with discontinuation from clinical trials (causing discontinuation in >1% of adults and/or >2% of pediatrics) were nausea, somnolence, sedation, vomiting, dizziness, and akathisia  [see      Adverse Reactions, Discontinuations Due to Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .

 The data described in this section are derived from a clinical trial database consisting of 9803 adult and pediatric patients exposed to one or more doses of RISPERDAL  (r)  for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar mania, autistic disorder, and other psychiatric disorders in pediatrics and elderly patients with dementia. Of these 9803 patients, 2687 were patients who received RISPERDAL  (r)  while participating in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. The conditions and duration of treatment with RISPERDAL  (r)  varied greatly and included (in overlapping categories) double-blind, fixed- and flexible-dose, placebo- or active-controlled studies and open-label phases of studies, inpatients and outpatients, and short-term (up to 12 weeks) and longer-term (up to 3 years) exposures. Safety was assessed by collecting adverse events and performing physical examinations, vital signs, body weights, laboratory analyses, and ECGs.

   EXCERPT:   The most common adverse reactions in clinical trials (>=5% and twice placebo) were parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia, tremor, sedation, dizziness, anxiety, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, upper abdominal pain, stomach discomfort, dyspepsia, diarrhea, salivary hypersecretion, constipation, dry mouth, increased appetite, increased weight, fatigue, rash, nasal congestion, upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, and pharyngolaryngeal pain.

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

     Dose Dependency of Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials  

     Extrapyramidal Symptoms  

 Data from two fixed-dose trials in adults with schizophrenia provided evidence of dose-relatedness for extrapyramidal symptoms associated with RISPERDAL  (r)  treatment.

 Two methods were used to measure extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) in an 8-week trial comparing 4 fixed doses of RISPERDAL  (r)  (2, 6, 10, and 16 mg/day), including (1) a Parkinsonism score (mean change from baseline) from the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale, and (2) incidence of spontaneous complaints of EPS:

            Similar methods were used to measure extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) in an 8-week trial comparing 5 fixed doses of RISPERDAL  (r)  (1, 4, 8, 12, and 16 mg/day):

                Dystonia  
 

     Class Effect:  Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups.

     Other Adverse Reactions  

 Adverse event data elicited by a checklist for side effects from a large study comparing 5 fixed doses of RISPERDAL  (r)  (1, 4, 8, 12, and 16 mg/day) were explored for dose-relatedness of adverse events. A Cochran-Armitage Test for trend in these data revealed a positive trend (p<0.05) for the following adverse reactions: somnolence, vision abnormal, dizziness, palpitations, weight increase, erectile dysfunction, ejaculation disorder, sexual function abnormal, fatigue, and skin discoloration.

     Changes in Body Weight  

 Weight gain was observed in short-term, controlled trials and longer-term uncontrolled studies in adult and pediatric patients  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.5)  ,  Adverse Reactions (6)  , and  Use in Specific Populations (8.4)  ].  

     Changes in ECG Parameters  

 Between-group comparisons for pooled placebo-controlled trials in adults revealed no statistically significant differences between risperidone and placebo in mean changes from baseline in ECG parameters, including QT, QTc, and PR intervals, and heart rate. When all RISPERDAL  (r)  doses were pooled from randomized controlled trials in several indications, there was a mean increase in heart rate of 1 beat per minute compared to no change for placebo patients. In short-term schizophrenia trials, higher doses of risperidone (8-16 mg/day) were associated with a higher mean increase in heart rate compared to placebo (4-6 beats per minute). In pooled placebo-controlled acute mania trials in adults, there were small decreases in mean heart rate, similar among all treatment groups.

 In the two placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with autistic disorder (aged 5 - 16 years) mean changes in heart rate were an increase of 8.4 beats per minute in the RISPERDAL  (r)  groups and 6.5 beats per minute in the placebo group. There were no other notable ECG changes.

 In a placebo-controlled acute mania trial in children and adolescents (aged 10 - 17 years), there were no significant changes in ECG parameters, other than the effect of RISPERDAL  (r)  to transiently increase pulse rate (< 6 beats per minute). In two controlled schizophrenia trials in adolescents (aged 13 - 17 years), there were no clinically meaningful changes in ECG parameters including corrected QT intervals between treatment groups or within treatment groups over time.

   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of risperidone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These adverse reactions include: alopecia, anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, atrial fibrillation, cardiopulmonary arrest, diabetic ketoacidosis in patients with impaired glucose metabolism, dysgeusia, hypoglycemia, hypothermia, ileus, inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, intestinal obstruction, jaundice, mania, pancreatitis, pituitary adenoma, precocious puberty, pulmonary embolism, QT prolongation, sleep apnea syndrome, sudden death, thrombocytopenia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, urinary retention, and water intoxication.
