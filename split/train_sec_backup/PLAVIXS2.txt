  WARNING: DIMINISHED ANTIPLATELET EFFECT IN PATIENTS WITH TWO LOSS-OF-FUNCTION ALLELES OF THE CYP2C19 GENE

  EXCERPT:   WARNING:  DIMINISHED ANTIPLATELET EFFECT IN PATIENTS WITH TWO LOSS-OF-FUNCTION ALLELES OF THE CYP2C19 GENE

   See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.  

 *  Effectiveness of Plavix depends on conversion to an active metabolite by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system, principally CYP2C19. (5.1, 12.3) 
 *  Tests are available to identify patients who are CYP2C19 poor metabolizers. (12.5) 
 *  Consider use of another platelet P2Y12 inhibitor in patients identified as CYP2C19 poor metabolizers. (5.1) 
    
 

    The effectiveness of Plavix results from its antiplatelet activity, which is dependent on its conversion to an active metabolite by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system, principally CYP2C19   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ,   Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  .  Plavix at recommended doses forms less of  the active metabolite and so has a reduced effect on platelet activity in patients who are homozygous for nonfunctional alleles of the CYP2C19 gene, (termed "CYP2C19 poor metabolizers").  Tests are available to identify patients who are CYP2C19 poor metabolizers   [see   Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)  ]  .  Consider use of another platelet P2Y12 inhibitor in patients identified as CYP2C19 poor metabolizers.
