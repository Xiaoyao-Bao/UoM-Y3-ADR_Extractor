    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: CARDIOMYOPATHY and INFUSION-RELATED REACTIONS

    WARNING: CARDIOMYOPATHY and INFUSION-RELATED REACTIONS  

    *  DOXIL (doxorubicin HCl liposome injection) can cause myocardial damage, including congestive heart failure, as the total cumulative dose of doxorubicin HCl approaches 550 mg/m2. In a clinical study of 250 patients with advanced cancer who were treated with DOXIL, the risk of cardiotoxicity was 11% when the cumulative anthracycline dose was between 450-550 mg/m2. Prior use of other anthracyclines or anthracenediones should be included in calculations of total cumulative dosage. The risk of cardiomyopathy may be increased at lower cumulative doses in patients with prior mediastinal irradiation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 
 *  Acute infusion-related reactions consisting of, but not limited to, flushing, shortness of breath, facial swelling, headache, chills, back pain, tightness in the chest or throat, and/or hypotension occurred in 11% of patients with solid tumors treated with DOXIL. Serious, life-threatening and fatal infusion reactions have been reported [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

 *  Myocardial damage may lead to congestive heart failure and may occur as the total cumulative dose of doxorubicin HCl approaches 550 mg/m2. The risk of cardiomyopathy may be increased at lower cumulative doses with mediastinal irradiation (5.1). 
 *  Acute infusion-related reactions occurred in 11% of patients with solid tumors. Serious, life-threatening, and fatal infusion reactions have been reported. Medications/emergency equipment to treat such reactions should be available for immediate use (5.2).
