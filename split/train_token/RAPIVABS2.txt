Neuropsychiatric B-OSE_Labeled_AE
Events I-OSE_Labeled_AE
Influenza B-Not_AE_Candidate
can O
be O
associated O
with O
a O
variety O
of O
neurologic B-NonOSE_AE
and O
behavioral O
symptoms I-NonOSE_AE
that O
can O
include O
events O
such O
as O
hallucinations B-NonOSE_AE
, O
delirium B-NonOSE_AE
, O
and O
abnormal B-NonOSE_AE
behavior I-NonOSE_AE
, O
in O
some O
cases O
resulting O
in O
fatal B-NonOSE_AE
outcomes O
. O

These O
events O
may O
occur O
in O
the O
setting O
of O
encephalitis B-Not_AE_Candidate
or O
encephalopathy B-Not_AE_Candidate
but O
can O
occur O
in O
uncomplicated O
influenza B-Not_AE_Candidate
as O
well O
. O

There O
have O
been O
postmarketing O
reports O
( O
from O
Japan O
) O
of O
delirium B-OSE_Labeled_AE
and O
abnormal B-OSE_Labeled_AE
behavior I-OSE_Labeled_AE
leading O
to O
injury B-NonOSE_AE
in O
patients O
with O
influenza B-Not_AE_Candidate
who O
were O
receiving O
neuraminidase O
inhibitors O
, O
including O
RAPIVAB O
. O

Because O
these O
events O
were O
reported O
voluntarily O
during O
clinical O
practice O
, O
estimates O
of O
frequency O
can O
not O
be O
made O
, O
but O
they O
appear O
to O
be O
uncommon O
. O

These O
events O
were O
reported O
primarily O
among O
pediatric O
patients O
and O
often O
had O
an O
abrupt O
onset O
and O
rapid O
resolution O
. O

The O
contribution O
of O
RAPIVAB O
to O
these O
events O
has O
not O
been O
established O
. O

Patients O
with O
influenza B-Not_AE_Candidate
should O
be O
closely O
monitored O
for O
signs O
of O
abnormal B-NonOSE_AE
behavior I-NonOSE_AE

5.3 O
Risk O
of O
Bacterial O
Infections O
There O
is O
no O
evidence O
for O
efficacy O
of O
RAPIVAB O
in O
any O
illness O
caused O
by O
agents O
other O
than O
influenza B-Not_AE_Candidate
viruses O
. O

Serious O
bacterial B-NonOSE_AE
infections I-NonOSE_AE
may O
begin O
with O
influenza B-NonOSE_AE
- I-NonOSE_AE
like I-NonOSE_AE
symptoms I-NonOSE_AE
or O
may O
coexist O
with O
or O
occur O
as O
complications O
during O
the O
course O
of O
influenza B-Not_AE_Candidate
. O

RAPIVAB O
has O
not O
been O
shown O
to O
prevent O
such O
complications O
. O

Prescribers O
should O
be O
alert O
to O
the O
potential O
for O
secondary B-NonOSE_AE
bacterial O
infections I-NonOSE_AE
