In O
general O

should O
not O
be O
repeated O
until O
leukocyte O

Since O
anemia B-OSE_Labeled_AE

cumulative O
, O
transfusions O
may O
be O
needed O
during O
treatment O
with O
carboplatin O
, O

is O
increased O
in O
patients O
who O
have O
received O
prior O
therapy O
, O
especially O
regimens O
including O
cisplatin O
. O

Marrow B-NonOSE_AE
suppression I-NonOSE_AE
is O
also O
increased O
in O
patients O
with O
impaired B-Not_AE_Candidate
kidney I-Not_AE_Candidate
function I-Not_AE_Candidate
. O

Initial O
carboplatin O
injection O
dosages O
in O
these O

should O
be O
appropriately O
reduced O
( O

use O
of O
carboplatin O
in O
combination O
with O

must O
be O
carefully O
managed O
with O
respect O

to O
minimize O

effects O
. O

Carboplatin O
has O
limited O
nephrotoxic B-OSE_Labeled_AE
potential O
, O
but O
concomitant O
treatment O
with O
aminoglycosides O
has O
resulted O
in O
increased B-NonOSE_AE
renal I-NonOSE_AE
and/or O
audiologic O
toxicity I-NonOSE_AE
, O
and O
caution O
must O
be O
exercised O
when O
a O
patient O
receives O
both O
drugs O
. O

Clinically O
significant O
hearing B-NonOSE_AE
loss I-NonOSE_AE
has O
been O
reported O
to O
occur O
in O
pediatric O
patients O
when O
carboplatin O
was O
administered O
at O
higher O
than O
recommended O
doses O
in O
combination O
with O
other O
ototoxic B-NonOSE_AE
agents O
. O

Carboplatin O
can O
induce O
emesis B-OSE_Labeled_AE
, O
which O
can O
be O
more O
severe O
in O
patients O
previously O
receiving O
emetogenic B-NonOSE_AE
therapy O
. O

The O
incidence O
and O
intensity O
of O
emesis B-NonOSE_AE
have O
been O
reduced O
by O
using O
premedication O
with O
antiemetics O
. O

Although O
no O
conclusive O
efficacy O
data O
exist O
with O
the O
following O
schedules O
of O

, O
lengthening O
the O
duration O

administration O
to O
24 O
hours O
or O
dividing O
the O
total O
dose O
over O
five O
consecutive O
daily O

resulted O
in O

Although O
peripheral B-NonOSE_AE
neurotoxicity I-NonOSE_AE
is O
infrequent O
, O
its O
incidence O
is O
increased O
in O
patients O
older O

65 O
years O
and O
in O
patients O
previously O
treated O
with O
cisplatin O
. O

Pre-existing O
cisplatin-induced O
neurotoxicity B-Not_AE_Candidate

not O
worsen O
in O
about O
70 O
% O
of O
the O
patients O
receiving O
carboplatin O
as O
secondary O
treatment O

Loss B-NonOSE_AE
of I-NonOSE_AE
vision I-NonOSE_AE
, O
which O
can O
be O
complete O
for O

has O
been O

after O
the O
use O
of O
carboplatin O
with O
doses O
higher O
than O
those O
recommended O

High O
dosages O

or O
if O
the O
