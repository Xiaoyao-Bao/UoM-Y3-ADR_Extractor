should O
be O
monitored O
as O
clinically O
appropriate O

Aminoglycosides O
can O
cause O

to O
a O

who O
use O
TOBI O
during O
pregnancy B-NonOSE_AE
, O
or O
become O
pregnant B-NonOSE_AE
while O
taking O
TOBI O
should O
be O
apprised O
of O
the O
potential O
hazard B-OSE_Labeled_AE

Ototoxicity O
Ototoxicity B-NonOSE_AE

measured O
by O
complaints O
of O
hearing B-NonOSE_AE

by O
audiometric O
evaluations O

did O
not O
occur O
with O
TOBI O
therapy O

clinical O
studies O

Tinnitus B-NonOSE_AE
may O
be O
a O
sentinel O
symptom O
of O
ototoxicity B-NonOSE_AE
, O
and O
therefore O
the O
onset O
of O
this O
symptom O
warrants O
caution O
( O

Ototoxicity B-OSE_Labeled_AE
, O
manifested O
as O
both O
auditory B-OSE_Labeled_AE

vestibular O
toxicity I-OSE_Labeled_AE

has O
been O
reported O
with O
parenteral O
aminoglycosides O

Vestibular B-OSE_Labeled_AE
toxicity I-OSE_Labeled_AE
may O
be O
manifested O
by O
vertigo B-NonOSE_AE

ataxia B-NonOSE_AE

In O
postmarketing O
experience O

patients O
receiving O
TOBI O

Some O
of O
these O
reports O
occurred O

Nephrotoxicity O
Nephrotoxicity B-OSE_Labeled_AE

seen O
during O
TOBI O
clinical O
studies O

has O
been O
associated O

If O
nephrotoxicity B-NonOSE_AE

in O
a O
patient O
receiving O
TOBI O

should O
be O
discontinued O
until O
