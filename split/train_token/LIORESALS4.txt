Prevention O

procedures O
, O

Patients O

the O
importance O

should O
be O
educated O
on O
the O
early O
symptoms O
of O
baclofen B-NonOSE_AE

. O

All O
patients O
receiving O
intrathecal O
baclofen O
therapy O
are O
potentially O
at O
risk O
for O
withdrawal B-OSE_Labeled_AE

Early O
symptoms O
of O
baclofen B-OSE_Labeled_AE

may O
include O
return O

, O
pruritus B-NonOSE_AE
, O
hypotension B-NonOSE_AE
, O
and O
paresthesias B-NonOSE_AE

Some O
clinical O
characteristics O

Rapid O

accurate O
diagnosis O

treatment O
in O
an O

The O
suggested O
treatment O
for O
intrathecal B-NonOSE_AE
baclofen I-NonOSE_AE

prevent O
potentially O
fatal B-NonOSE_AE
