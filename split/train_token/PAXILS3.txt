Discontinuation O
of O
Treatment O
With O
PAXIL O
: O
Recent O
clinical O
trials O
supporting O
the O

for O
PAXIL O
employed O
a O
taper-phase O
regimen O
, O
rather O

an O

. O

The O
taper-phase O
regimen O
used O
in O
GAD B-Not_AE_Candidate
and O
PTSD B-Not_AE_Candidate
clinical O
trials O
involved O
an O
incremental O
decrease O
in O
the O
daily O
dose O
by O
10 O
mg/day O

With O
this O

In O
the O

these O

During O

A O

Tamoxifen O
: O
Some O
studies O
have O
shown O

, O
as O
measured O
by O
the O

However O
, O
other O

have O

. O

It O
is O
uncertain O
whether O
the O

tamoxifen O
has O
a O
significant O
adverse O
effect O
on O
the O

of O
tamoxifen O
. O

One O
study O
suggests O
that O
the O
risk O
may O
increase O
with O
longer O
duration O
of O

. O

When O
tamoxifen O
is O
used O
for O
the O
treatment O
or O
prevention O
of O
breast B-Not_AE_Candidate

, O

Akathisia O
: O
The O
use O
of O
paroxetine O

has O
been O
