    Estrogen-Alone Therapy  

     Endometrial Cancer  

   There is an increased risk of  endometrial≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   cancer≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  in a woman with a uterus who uses unopposed estrogens. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of  endometrial≠B-NonOSE_AE   hyperplasia≠I-NonOSE_AE , which may be a precursor to  endometrial≠B-NonOSE_AE   cancer≠I-NonOSE_AE . Adequate diagnostic measures, including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out  malignancy≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  in  postmenopausal≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  women with undiagnosed persistent or recurring  abnormal≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   genital≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   bleeding≠I-Not_AE_Candidate    [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ].    

     Cardiovascular Disorders and Probable Dementia  

   Estrogen-alone therapy should not be used for the prevention of  cardiovascular≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  or  dementia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate    [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1,     5.3)  , and   Clinical Studies (14.5,     14.6)  ]  .  

   The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) estrogen-alone substudy reported increased risks of  stroke≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  deep≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   vein≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   thrombosis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  DVT≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ) in  postmenopausal≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  women (50 to 79 years of age) during 7.1 years of treatment with daily oral conjugated estrogens (CE) [0.625 mg]-alone, relative to placebo  [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  , and   Clinical Studies (14.5)  ].    

   The WHI Memory Study (WHIMS) estrogen-alone ancillary study of WHI reported an increased risk of developing probable  dementia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  in  postmenopausal≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  women 65 years of age or older during 5.2 years of treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone, relative to placebo. It is unknown whether this finding applies to younger  postmenopausal≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  women   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ,   Use in Specific Populations (8.5)  , and   Clinical Studies (14.6)  ]  .  

   In the absence of comparable data, these risks should be assumed to be similar for other doses of CE and other dosage forms of estrogens.  

   Estrogens with or without progestins should be prescribed at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman.  

     Estrogen Plus Progestin Therapy  

     Cardiovascular Disorders and Probable Dementia  

   Estrogen plus progestin therapy should not be used for the prevention of  cardiovascular≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  or  dementia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate    [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1,     5.3)  , and   Clinical Studies (14.5  ,   14.6)  ].    

   The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported increased risks of  DVT≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  pulmonary≠B-NonOSE_AE   embolism≠I-NonOSE_AE   (≠I-NonOSE_AE  PE≠I-NonOSE_AE ),  stroke≠B-NonOSE_AE  and  myocardial≠B-NonOSE_AE   infarction≠I-NonOSE_AE   (≠I-NonOSE_AE  MI≠I-NonOSE_AE ) in  postmenopausal≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  women (50 to 79 years of age) during 5.6 years of treatment with daily oral CE (0.625 mg) combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) [2.5 mg], relative to placebo   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1),   and   Clinical Studies (14.5)  ]  .  

   The WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of the WHI, reported an increased risk of developing probable  dementia≠B-NonOSE_AE  in  postmenopausal≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  women 65 years of age or older during 4 years of treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg) combined with MPA (2.5 mg), relative to placebo. It is unknown whether this finding applies to younger  postmenopausal≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  women   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ,   Use in Specific Populations (8.5)  , and   Clinical Studies (14.6)  ]  .  

     Breast Cancer  

   The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy also demonstrated an increased risk of invasive  breast≠B-NonOSE_AE   cancer≠I-NonOSE_AE    [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  , and   Clinical Studies (14.5)  ].    

   In the absence of comparable data, these risks should be assumed to be similar for other doses of CE and MPA, and other combinations and dosage forms of estrogens and progestins.  

   Estrogens with or without progestins should be prescribed at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman.
