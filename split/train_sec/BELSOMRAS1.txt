  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 In 3-month controlled efficacy trials (Study 1 and Study 2), 1263 patients were exposed to BELSOMRA including 493 patients who received BELSOMRA 15 mg or 20 mg (see  Table 1  ).



 In a long-term study, additional patients (n=521) were treated with BELSOMRA at higher than recommended doses, including a total of 160 patients who received BELSOMRA for at least one year.

         The pooled safety data described below (see  Table 2  ) reflect the adverse reaction profile during the first 3 months of treatment.
 

     Adverse Reactions Resulting in Discontinuation of Treatment  



 The incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions for patients treated with 15 mg or 20 mg of BELSOMRA was 3% compared to 5% for placebo. No individual adverse reaction led to discontinuation at an incidence >=1%.



     Most Common Adverse Reactions  



 In clinical trials of patients with  insomnia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  treated with BELSOMRA 15 mg or 20 mg, the most common adverse reaction (reported in 5% or more of patients treated with BELSOMRA and at least twice the placebo rate) was  somnolence≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (BELSOMRA 7%; placebo 3%).



 Table 2 shows the percentage of patients with adverse reactions during the first three months of treatment, based on the pooled data from 3-month controlled efficacy trials (Study 1 and Study 2).



 At doses of 15 or 20 mg, the incidence of  somnolence≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was higher in females (8%) than in males (3%). Of the adverse reactions reported in Table 2, the following occurred in women at an incidence of at least twice that in men:  headache≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  abnormal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   dreams≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  dry≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   mouth≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  cough≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  upper≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   respiratory≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   tract≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infection≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE .



 The adverse reaction profile in elderly patients was generally consistent with non-elderly patients. The adverse reactions reported during long-term treatment up to 1 year were generally consistent with those observed during the first 3 months of treatment.

             Dose Relationship for Adverse Reactions  
 

 There is evidence of a dose relationship for many of the adverse reactions associated with BELSOMRA use, particularly for certain  CNS≠B-NonOSE_AE   adverse≠I-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE .



 In a placebo-controlled crossover study (Study 3), non-elderly adult patients were treated for up to one month with BELSOMRA at doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg (2 times the maximum recommended dose) or 80 mg (4 times the maximum recommended dose). In patients treated with BELSOMRA 10 mg (n=62), although no adverse reactions were reported at an incidence of >=2%, the types of adverse reactions observed were similar to those observed in patients treated with BELSOMRA 20 mg. BELSOMRA was associated with a dose-related increase in  somnolence≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE : 2% at the 10 mg dose, 5% at the 20 mg dose, 12% at the 40 mg dose, and 11% at the 80 mg dose, compared to <1% for placebo. BELSOMRA was also associated with a dose-related  increase≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   serum≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   cholesterol≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE : 1 mg/dL at the 10 mg dose, 2 mg/dL at the 20 mg dose, 3 mg/dL at the 40 mg dose, and 6 mg/dL at the 80 mg dose after 4 weeks of treatment, compared to a 4 mg/dL decrease for placebo.
