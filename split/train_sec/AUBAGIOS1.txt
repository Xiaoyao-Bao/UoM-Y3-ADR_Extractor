  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 A total of 2047 patients receiving AUBAGIO (7 mg or 14 mg once daily) constituted the safety population in the pooled analysis of placebo controlled studies in patients with  relapsing≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  forms of  multiple≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   sclerosis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ; of these, 71% were female. The average age was 37 years.



 Table 1 lists adverse reactions in placebo-controlled trials with rates that were at least 2% for AUBAGIO patients and also at least 2% above the rate in placebo patients. The most common were  headache≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , an  increase≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   ALT≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  diarrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  alopecia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  nausea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . The adverse reaction most commonly associated with discontinuation was an  increase≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   ALT≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (3.3%, 2.6%, and 2.3% of all patients in the AUBAGIO 7 mg, AUBAGIO 14 mg, and placebo treatment arms, respectively).

 Four  cardiovascular≠B-NonOSE_AE   deaths≠B-NonOSE_AE , including three  sudden≠B-NonOSE_AE   deaths≠I-NonOSE_AE , and one  myocardial≠B-NonOSE_AE   infarction≠I-NonOSE_AE  in a patient with a history of  hyperlipidemia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and  hypertension≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  were reported among approximately 2600 patients exposed to AUBAGIO in the premarketing database. These  cardiovascular≠B-NonOSE_AE   deaths≠B-NonOSE_AE  occurred during uncontrolled extension studies, one to nine years after initiation of treatment. A relationship between AUBAGIO and  cardiovascular≠B-NonOSE_AE   death≠B-NonOSE_AE  has not been established.



     Acute Renal Failure  



 In placebo-controlled studies,  creatinine≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   values≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   increased≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  more than 100% over baseline in 8/1045 (0.8%) patients in the 7 mg AUBAGIO group and 6/1002 (0.6%) patients in the 14 mg AUBAGIO group versus 4/997 (0.4%) patients in the placebo group. These elevations were transient. Some elevations were accompanied by  hyperkalemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .
