  WARNING: ASTHMA-RELATED DEATH

    Long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists (LABA) increase the risk of  asthma≠B-NonOSE_AE -related  death≠B-NonOSE_AE .

Data from a large, placebo-controlled US study that compared the safety

of another long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist

(salmeterol) or placebo added to usual  asthma≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  therapy showed an increase

in  asthma≠B-NonOSE_AE -related  deaths≠B-NonOSE_AE  in patients receiving salmeterol. This finding

with salmeterol is considered a class effect of LABA, including olodaterol,

the active ingredient in STRIVERDI RESPIMAT.  The safety and efficacy

of STRIVERDI RESPIMAT in patients with  asthma≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  have not been established.

 STRIVERDI RESPIMAT is not indicated for the treatment of  asthma≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  [  see Contraindications (  4  ), Warnings

and Precautions (  5.1  )  ].
