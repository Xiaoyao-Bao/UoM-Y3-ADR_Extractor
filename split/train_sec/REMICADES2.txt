    WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS and MALIGNANCY  

  EXCERPT:   WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS and MALIGNANCY

   See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.  

 *  Increased risk of serious infections leading to hospitalization or death, including tuberculosis (TB), bacterial sepsis, invasive fungal infections (such as histoplasmosis) and infections due to other opportunistic pathogens. 
 *  Discontinue REMICADE if a patient develops a serious infection. 
 *  Perform test for latent TB; if positive, start treatment for TB prior to starting REMICADE. Monitor all patients for active TB during treatment, even if initial latent TB test is negative. (5.1) 
 *  Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers, including REMICADE. 
 *  Postmarketing cases of fatal hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL) have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including REMICADE. Almost all had received azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine concomitantly with a TNF-blocker at or prior to diagnosis. The majority of REMICADE cases were reported in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, most of whom were adolescent or young adult males. (5.2) 
    
 

    SERIOUS INFECTIONS  

   Patients treated with REMICADE  (r)   are at increased risk for developing serious  infections≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  that may lead to hospitalization or  death≠B-NonOSE_AE    [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)   and   Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Most patients who developed these  infections≠B-NonOSE_AE  were taking concomitant  immunosuppressants≠B-NonOSE_AE  such as methotrexate or corticosteroids.    

   REMICADE should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious  infection≠B-NonOSE_AE  or  sepsis≠B-NonOSE_AE .    

   Reported  infections≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  include:  

 *   Active≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   tuberculosis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , including  reactivation≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   latent≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   tuberculosis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . Patients with  tuberculosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  have frequently presented with disseminated or  extrapulmonary≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  disease. Patients should be tested for  latent≠B-NonOSE_AE   tuberculosis≠I-NonOSE_AE  before REMICADE use and during therapy.1,2 Treatment for  latent≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   infection≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  should be initiated prior to REMICADE use. 
 *   Invasive≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   fungal≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infections≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , including  histoplasmosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  coccidioidomycosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  candidiasis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  aspergillosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  blastomycosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  pneumocystosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . Patients with  histoplasmosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  or other invasive  fungal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   infections≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease.  Antigen≠B-NonOSE_AE  and antibody  testing≠I-NonOSE_AE   for≠I-NonOSE_AE   histoplasmosis≠I-NonOSE_AE   may≠I-NonOSE_AE   be≠I-NonOSE_AE   negative≠I-NonOSE_AE  in some patients with active  infection≠B-NonOSE_AE . Empiric anti-fungal therapy should be considered in patients at risk for  invasive≠B-NonOSE_AE   fungal≠I-NonOSE_AE   infections≠I-NonOSE_AE  who develop severe systemic  illness≠B-NonOSE_AE . 
 *   Bacterial≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , viral and other  infections≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   due≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   to≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   opportunistic≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   pathogens≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , including  Legionella≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  Listeria≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . 
      The risks and benefits of treatment with REMICADE should be carefully considered prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent  infection≠B-Not_AE_Candidate .  
 

   Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of  infection≠B-NonOSE_AE  during and after treatment with REMICADE, including the possible development of  tuberculosis≠B-NonOSE_AE  in patients who  tested≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   negative≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   for≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   latent≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   tuberculosis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   infection≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  prior to initiating therapy.  

     MALIGNANCY  

    Lymphoma≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and other  malignancies≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , some  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE , have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers, including REMICADE   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]  .            

   Postmarketing cases of  hepatosplenic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   T≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  cell≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   lymphoma≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  HSTCL≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ), a rare type of  T≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  cell≠I-NonOSE_AE   lymphoma≠I-NonOSE_AE , have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including REMICADE. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE . Almost all patients had received treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine concomitantly with a TNF-blocker at or prior to diagnosis. The majority of reported REMICADE cases have occurred in patients with  Crohn≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  s≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  or  ulcerative≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   colitis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and most were in adolescent and young adult males.
