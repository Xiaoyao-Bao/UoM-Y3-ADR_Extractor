  WARNINGS: SUICIDALITY AND ANTIDEPRESSANT DRUGS



    Antidepressants increased the risk compared to placebo of  suicidal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  thinking and  behavior≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  ( suicidality≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ) in children, adolescents, and young adults in short-term studies of  major≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depressive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   (≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  MDD≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ) and other  psychiatric≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorders≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Anyone considering the use of Lexapro or any other antidepressant in a child, adolescent, or young adult must balance this risk with the clinical need. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE  with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.  Depression≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and certain other  psychiatric≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorders≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  are themselves associated with increases in the risk of  suicide≠B-NonOSE_AE . Patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening,  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE , or unusual  changes≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   behavior≠I-NonOSE_AE . Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber.  Lexapro is not approved for use in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age.     [See Warnings and Precautions: Clinical Worsening and  Suicide≠B-NonOSE_AE  Risk (  5.1  ), Patient Counseling Information: Information for Patients (  17.1  ), and Use in Specific Populations: Pediatric Use (  8.4  )].
