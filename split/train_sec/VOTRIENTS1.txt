  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

       Renal≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   Cell≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   Carcinoma≠I-Not_AE_Candidate :  The safety of VOTRIENT has been evaluated in 977 patients in the monotherapy trials which included 586 patients with  RCC≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  at the time of NDA submission. With a median duration of treatment of 7.4 months (range: 0.1 to 27.6), the most commonly observed adverse reactions (>=20%) in the 586 patients were  diarrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  hypertension≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  hair≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   color≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   change≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  nausea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  fatigue≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  anorexia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  vomiting≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .
 

 The data described below reflect the safety profile of VOTRIENT in 290  RCC≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  patients who participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial  [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]  . The median duration of treatment was 7.4 months (range: 0 to 23) for patients who received VOTRIENT and 3.8 months (range: 0 to 22) for the placebo arm. Forty-two percent of patients on VOTRIENT required a dose interruption. Thirty-six percent of patients on VOTRIENT were dose reduced. Table 1 presents the most common adverse reactions occurring in >=10% of patients who received VOTRIENT.

    Soft≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   Tissue≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   Sarcoma≠I-Not_AE_Candidate :  The safety of VOTRIENT has been evaluated in 382 patients with advanced  soft≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   tissue≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   sarcoma≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , with a median duration of treatment of 3.6 months (range: 0 to 53). The most commonly observed adverse reactions (>=20%) in the 382 patients were  fatigue≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  diarrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  nausea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  decreased≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   weight≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  hypertension≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  decreased≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   appetite≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  vomiting≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  tumor≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  hair≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   color≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   changes≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  musculoskeletal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  headache≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  dysgeusia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  dyspnea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  skin≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   hypopigmentation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE .



 The data described below reflect the safety profile of VOTRIENT in 240 patients who participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial  [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]  . The median duration of treatment was 4.5 months (range: 0 to 24) for patients who received VOTRIENT and 1.9 months (range: 0 to 24) for the placebo arm. Fifty-eight percent of patients on VOTRIENT required a dose interruption. Thirty-eight percent of patients on VOTRIENT had their dose reduced. Seventeen percent of patients who received VOTRIENT discontinued therapy due to adverse reactions. Table 3 presents the most common adverse reactions occurring in >=10% of patients who received VOTRIENT.

 Other adverse reactions observed more commonly in patients treated with VOTRIENT that occurred in >=5% of patients and at an incidence of more than 2% difference from placebo included  insomnia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (9% versus 6%),  hypothyroidism≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (8% versus 0%),  dysphonia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (8% versus 2%),  epistaxis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (8% versus 2%),  left≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   ventricular≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   dysfunction≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (8% versus 4%),  dyspepsia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (7% versus 2%),  dry≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   skin≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (6% versus <1%),  chills≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (5% versus 1%),  vision≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   blurred≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (5% versus 2%), and  nail≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   disorder≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (5% versus 0%).

    Diarrhea≠B-NonOSE_AE :   Diarrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred frequently and was predominantly mild to moderate in severity in both the  RCC≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and  STS≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  clinical trials. Patients should be advised how to manage mild  diarrhea≠B-NonOSE_AE  and to notify their healthcare provider if moderate to severe  diarrhea≠B-NonOSE_AE  occurs so appropriate management can be implemented to minimize its impact.



    Lipase≠B-NonOSE_AE   Elevations≠I-NonOSE_AE :  In a single-arm  RCC≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  trial,  increases≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  in  lipase≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  values were observed for 27% (48/181) of patients.  Elevations≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  in  lipase≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  as an adverse reaction were reported for 4% (10/225) of patients and were Grade 3 for 6 patients and Grade 4 for 1 patient. In the  RCC≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  trials of VOTRIENT, clinical  pancreatitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was observed in <1% (4/586) of patients.



    Pneumothorax≠B-NonOSE_AE :  Two of 290 patients treated with VOTRIENT and no patient on the placebo arm in the randomized  RCC≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  trial developed a  pneumothorax≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . In the randomized trial of VOTRIENT for the treatment of  STS≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ,  pneumothorax≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred in 3% (8/240) of patients treated with VOTRIENT and in no patients on the placebo arm.



    Bradycardia≠B-NonOSE_AE :  In the randomized trial of VOTRIENT for the treatment of  RCC≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ,  bradycardia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  based on vital signs (<60 beats per minute) was observed in 19% (52/280) of patients treated with VOTRIENT and in 11% (16/144) of patients on the placebo arm.  Bradycardia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was reported as an adverse reaction in 2% (7/290) of patients treated with VOTRIENT compared with <1% (1/145) of patients treated with placebo. In the randomized trial of VOTRIENT for the treatment of  STS≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ,  bradycardia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  based on vital signs (<60 beats per minute) was observed in 19% (45/238) of patients treated with VOTRIENT and in 4% (5/121) of patients on the placebo arm.  Bradycardia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was reported as an adverse reaction in 2% (4/240) of patients treated with VOTRIENT compared with <1% (1/123) of patients treated with placebo.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of VOTRIENT. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
