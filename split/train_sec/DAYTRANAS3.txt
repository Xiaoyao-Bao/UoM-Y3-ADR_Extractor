   5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

     EXCERPT:    *  Serious Cardiovascular Events: Sudden death has been reported in association with CNS stimulant treatment at usual doses in children and adolescents with structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious heart problems. Sudden death, stroke, and myocardial infarction have been reported in adults taking stimulant drugs at usual doses for ADHD. Stimulant products generally should not be used in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, coronary artery disease, or other serious heart problems. (  5.1  ) 
 *  Increase in Blood Pressure: Monitor patients for changes in heart rate and blood pressure and use with caution in patients for whom an increase in blood pressure or heart rate would be problematic. (  5.1  ) 
 *  Psychiatric Adverse Events: Use of stimulants may cause treatment-emergent psychotic or manic symptoms in patients with no prior history, or exacerbation of symptoms in patients with pre-existing psychiatric illness. Clinical evaluation for Bipolar Disorder is recommended prior to stimulant use. Monitor for aggressive behavior. (  5.2  ) 
 *  Seizures: Stimulants may lower the convulsive threshold. Discontinue in the presence of seizures. (  5.3  ) 
 *  Priapism: Cases of painful and prolonged penile erections and priapism have been reported with methylphenidate products. Immediate medical attention should be sought if signs or symptoms of prolonged penile erections or priapism are observed (  5.4  ) 
 *  Peripheral Vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon: Stimulants used to treat ADHD are associated with peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon. Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during treatment with ADHD stimulants. (  5.5  ) 
 *  Long-Term Suppression of Growth: Monitor height and weight at appropriate intervals in pediatric patients. (  5.6  ) 
 *  Chemical Leukoderma: Daytrana use may result in a persistent loss of skin pigmentation at and around the application site. Loss of pigmentation, in some cases, has been reported at other sites distant from the application site. Monitor for signs of skin depigmentation. Discontinue Daytrana if it occurs. (  5.7  ) 
 *  Contact Sensitization: Use of Daytrana may lead to contact sensitization. Treatment should be discontinued if contact sensitization is suspected. Erythema is commonly seen with use of Daytrana and is not by itself an indication of sensitization. However, contact sensitization should be suspected if erythema is accompanied by evidence of a more intense local reaction (edema, papules, vesicles) that does not significantly improve within 48 hours or spreads beyond the patch site. (  5.8  ) 
 *  Visual Disturbance: Difficulties with accommodation and blurring of vision have been reported with stimulant treatment. (  5.9  ) 
 *  External Heat: Patients should be advised to avoid exposing the Daytrana application site to direct external heat sources. When heat is applied to Daytrana after patch application, both the rate and extent of absorption are significantly increased. (  5.10  ) 
 *  Hematologic monitoring: Periodic CBC, differential, and platelet counts are advised during prolonged therapy. (  5.11  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Serious Cardiovascular Events

  Sudden Death and Pre-existing Structural Cardiac Abnormalities or Other Serious Heart Problems

  Children and Adolescents  

  Sudden≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   death≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  has been reported in association with CNS stimulant treatment at usual doses in children and adolescents with  structural≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   cardiac≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   abnormalities≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  or other serious  heart≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   problems≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Although some serious  heart≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   problems≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  alone carry an increased risk of  sudden≠B-NonOSE_AE   death≠I-NonOSE_AE , stimulant products generally should not be used in children or adolescents with known serious  structural≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   cardiac≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   abnormalities≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  cardiomyopathy≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , serious  heart≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   rhythm≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   abnormalities≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , or other serious  cardiac≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   problems≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  that may place them at increased vulnerability to the sympathomimetic effects of a stimulant drug.

  Adults  

  Sudden≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   deaths≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  stroke≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  myocardial≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   infarction≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported in adults taking stimulant drugs at usual doses for  ADHD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate . Although the role of stimulants in these adult cases is also unknown, adults have a greater likelihood than children of having serious  structural≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   cardiac≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   abnormalities≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  cardiomyopathy≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , serious  heart≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   rhythm≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   abnormalities≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  coronary≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   artery≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , or other serious  cardiac≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   problems≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Adults with such abnormalities should also generally not be treated with stimulant drugs.

 Hypertension and Other Cardiovascular Conditions

 Stimulant medications cause a modest  increase≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  average  blood≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   pressure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (about 2-4 mmHg) and average heart rate (about 3-6 bpm), and individuals may have larger increases. While the mean changes alone would not be expected to have short-term consequences, all patients should be monitored for larger  changes≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   heart≠I-NonOSE_AE   rate≠I-NonOSE_AE  and blood pressure. Caution is indicated in treating patients whose underlying medical conditions might be compromised by  increases≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   blood≠I-NonOSE_AE   pressure≠I-NonOSE_AE  or heart rate, e.g., those with pre-existing  hypertension≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ,  heart≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   failure≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , recent  myocardial≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   infarction≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , or  ventricular≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   arrhythmia≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  [  see Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .

 Assessing Cardiovascular Status in Patients Being Treated With Stimulant Medications

 Children, adolescents, or adults who are being considered for treatment with stimulant medications should have a careful history (including assessment for a family history of  sudden≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   death≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  or  ventricular≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   arrhythmia≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ) and physical exam to assess for the presence of  cardiac≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , and should receive further cardiac evaluation if findings suggest such disease (e.g., electrocardiogram and echocardiogram). Patients who develop symptoms such as  exertional≠B-NonOSE_AE   chest≠I-NonOSE_AE   pain≠I-NonOSE_AE , unexplained  syncope≠B-NonOSE_AE , or other symptoms suggestive of  cardiac≠B-NonOSE_AE   disease≠I-NonOSE_AE  during stimulant treatment should undergo a prompt cardiac evaluation.

    5.2 Psychiatric Adverse Events

  Pre-Existing Psychosis

 Administration of stimulants may  exacerbate≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   symptoms≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  behavior disturbance and  thought≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   disorder≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  in patients with a pre-existing  psychotic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate .

 Bipolar Illness

 Particular care should be taken in using stimulants to treat  ADHD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  in patients with comorbid  bipolar≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  because of concern for possible  induction≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   a≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  mixed/ manic≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   episode≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  in such patients. Prior to initiating treatment with a stimulant, patients with comorbid  depressive≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   symptoms≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for  bipolar≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ; such screening should include a detailed  psychiatric≠B-NonOSE_AE  history, including a family history of  suicide≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ,  bipolar≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , and  depression≠B-Not_AE_Candidate .

 Emergence of New Psychotic or Manic Symptoms

 Treatment emergent  psychotic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  or manic  symptoms≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , e.g.,  hallucinations≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  delusional≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   thinking≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , or  mania≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  in children and adolescents without a prior history of  psychotic≠B-NonOSE_AE   illness≠I-NonOSE_AE  or  mania≠B-NonOSE_AE  can be caused by stimulants at usual doses. If such symptoms occur, consideration should be given to a possible causal role of the stimulant, and discontinuation of treatment may be appropriate. In a pooled analysis of multiple short term, placebo-controlled studies, such symptoms occurred in about 0.1% (4 patients with events out of 3,482 exposed to methylphenidate or amphetamine for several weeks at usual doses) of stimulant-treated patients compared to none in placebo-treated patients.

 Aggression

  Aggressive≠B-NonOSE_AE   behavior≠I-NonOSE_AE  or  hostility≠B-NonOSE_AE  is often observed in children and adolescents with  ADHD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , and has been reported in clinical trials and the postmarketing experience of some medications indicated for the treatment of  ADHD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate . Although there is no systematic evidence that stimulants cause  aggressive≠B-NonOSE_AE   behavior≠I-NonOSE_AE  or  hostility≠B-NonOSE_AE , patients beginning treatment for  ADHD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  should be monitored for the appearance of or  worsening≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   aggressive≠I-NonOSE_AE   behavior≠I-NonOSE_AE  or  hostility≠B-NonOSE_AE .

    5.3  Seizures≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE 

  There is some clinical evidence that stimulants may  lower≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   the≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   convulsive≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   threshold≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  in patients with prior history of  seizures≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , in patients with prior  EEG≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   abnormalities≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  in absence of  seizures≠B-NonOSE_AE , and, very rarely, in patients without a history of  seizures≠B-NonOSE_AE  and no prior EEG evidence of  seizures≠B-NonOSE_AE . In the presence of  seizures≠B-NonOSE_AE , the drug should be discontinued.

    5.4 Priapism

   Prolonged≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and painful  erections≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , sometimes requiring surgical intervention, have been reported with methylphenidate products in both pediatric and adult patients.  Priapism≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was not reported with drug initiation but developed after some time on the drug, often subsequent to an increase in dose.  Priapism≠B-NonOSE_AE  has also appeared during a period of drug withdrawal (drug holidays or during discontinuation). Patients who develop  abnormally≠B-NonOSE_AE   sustained≠I-NonOSE_AE  or frequent and painful  erections≠I-NonOSE_AE  should seek immediate medical attention.

    5.5 Peripheral Vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon

  Stimulants, including Daytrana, used to treat  ADHD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  are associated with  peripheral≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   vasculopathy≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , including  Raynaud≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  '≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  s≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   phenomenon≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . Signs and symptoms are usually intermittent and mild; however, very rare sequelae include  digital≠B-NonOSE_AE   ulceration≠I-NonOSE_AE  and/or  soft≠B-NonOSE_AE   tissue≠I-NonOSE_AE   breakdown≠I-NonOSE_AE . Effects of  peripheral≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   vasculopathy≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , including  Raynaud≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  '≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  s≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   phenomenon≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , were observed in post-marketing reports at different times and at therapeutic doses in all age groups throughout the course of treatment. Signs and symptoms generally improve after reduction in dose or discontinuation of drug. Careful observation for  digital≠B-NonOSE_AE   changes≠I-NonOSE_AE  is necessary during treatment with  ADHD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  stimulants. Further clinical evaluation (e.g., rheumatology referral) may be appropriate for certain patients

    5.6 Long-Term Suppression of Growth

  Careful follow-up of weight and height in children ages 7 to 10 years who were randomized to either methylphenidate or non-medication treatment groups over 14 months, as well as in naturalistic subgroups of newly methylphenidate-treated and non-medication treated children over 36 months (to the ages of 10 to 13 years), suggests that consistently medicated children (i.e., treatment for 7 days per week throughout the year) have a temporary  slowing≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   growth≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   rate≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (on average, a total of about 2 cm  less≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   growth≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   height≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and 2.7 kg  less≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   growth≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   weight≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  over 3 years), without evidence of growth rebound during this period of development. Published data are inadequate to determine whether chronic use of amphetamines may cause a similar  suppression≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   growth≠I-NonOSE_AE , however, it is anticipated that they likely have this effect as well. Therefore, growth should be monitored during treatment with stimulants, and patients who are  not≠B-NonOSE_AE   growing≠I-NonOSE_AE  or gaining height or weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted.

    5.7  Chemical≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   Leukoderma≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE 

  Daytrana use may result in a persistent  loss≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   skin≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   pigmentation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   at≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   and≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   around≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   the≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   application≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   site≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE .  Loss≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   pigmentation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , in some cases, has been reported at other sites distant from the application site.  Chemical≠B-NonOSE_AE   leukoderma≠I-NonOSE_AE  can mimic the appearance of  vitiligo≠B-NonOSE_AE , particularly when the  loss≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   skin≠I-NonOSE_AE   pigmentation≠I-NonOSE_AE   involves≠I-NonOSE_AE   areas≠I-NonOSE_AE   distant≠I-NonOSE_AE   from≠I-NonOSE_AE   the≠I-NonOSE_AE   application≠I-NonOSE_AE   site≠I-NonOSE_AE . Individuals with a history of  vitiligo≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and/or a family history of  vitiligo≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  may be more at risk.  Skin≠B-NonOSE_AE   depigmentation≠I-NonOSE_AE  may persist even after Daytrana use is discontinued. Monitor for signs of  skin≠B-NonOSE_AE   depigmentation≠I-NonOSE_AE , and advise patients to immediately inform their healthcare provider if  changes≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   skin≠I-NonOSE_AE   pigmentation≠I-NonOSE_AE  occur. Discontinue the Daytrana patch in patients with  chemical≠B-NonOSE_AE   leukoderma≠I-NonOSE_AE .

    5.8 Contact Sensitization

  In an open-label study of 305 subjects conducted to characterize  dermal≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE  in children with  ADHD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  treated with Daytrana using a 9-hour wear time, one subject (0.3%) was confirmed by patch testing to be  sensitized≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   to≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   methylphenidate≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  ( allergic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   contact≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   dermatitis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ). This subject experienced  erythema≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and edema  at≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   Daytrana≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   application≠I-OSE_L abeled≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  _≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  AE≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE     sites≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  ≠≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  I≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  OSE≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  _≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  Labeled≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  _≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  AE≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE    with≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  concurrent  urticarial≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   lesions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   on≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   the≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   abdomen≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and legs resulting in treatment discontinuation. This subject was not transitioned to oral methylphenidate.

 Use of Daytrana may lead to  contact≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   sensitization≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . Daytrana should be discontinued if  contact≠B-NonOSE_AE   sensitization≠I-NonOSE_AE  is suspected.  Erythema≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  is commonly seen with use of Daytrana and is not by itself an indication of  sensitization≠B-NonOSE_AE . However,  contact≠B-NonOSE_AE   sensitization≠I-NonOSE_AE  should be suspected if  erythema≠B-NonOSE_AE  is accompanied by evidence of a more intense  local≠B-NonOSE_AE   reaction≠I-NonOSE_AE  (edema, papules, vesicles) that does not significantly improve within 48 hours or spreads beyond the patch site. Confirmation of a diagnosis of  contact≠B-NonOSE_AE   sensitization≠I-NonOSE_AE  ( allergic≠B-NonOSE_AE   contact≠I-NonOSE_AE   dermatitis≠I-NonOSE_AE ) may require further diagnostic testing.

 Patients  sensitized≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   from≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   use≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   Daytrana≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , as evidenced by development of an  allergic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   contact≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   dermatitis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , may develop  systemic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   sensitization≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  or other systemic reactions if methylphenidate-containing products are taken via other routes, e.g., orally. Manifestations of  systemic≠B-NonOSE_AE   sensitization≠I-NonOSE_AE  may include a  flare≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  up≠I-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   previous≠I-NonOSE_AE   dermatitis≠I-NonOSE_AE  or of prior positive patch-test sites, or  generalized≠B-NonOSE_AE   skin≠I-NonOSE_AE   eruptions≠I-NonOSE_AE  in previously unaffected skin. Other systemic reactions may include  headache≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  fever≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  malaise≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  arthralgia≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  diarrhea≠B-NonOSE_AE , or  vomiting≠B-NonOSE_AE . No cases of  systemic≠B-NonOSE_AE   sensitization≠I-NonOSE_AE  have been observed in clinical trials of Daytrana.

 Patients who develop  contact≠B-NonOSE_AE   sensitization≠I-NonOSE_AE  to Daytrana and require oral treatment with methylphenidate should be initiated on oral medication under close medical supervision. It is possible that some patients  sensitized≠B-NonOSE_AE   to≠I-NonOSE_AE   methylphenidate≠I-NonOSE_AE  by exposure to Daytrana may not be able to take methylphenidate in any form.

    5.9  Visual≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   Disturbance≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE 

   Difficulties≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   with≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   accommodation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  blurring≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   vision≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported with stimulant treatment.

    5.10 Patients Using External Heat

  Patients should be advised to avoid exposing the Daytrana application site to  direct≠B-NonOSE_AE   external≠I-NonOSE_AE   heat≠I-NonOSE_AE   sources≠I-NonOSE_AE , such as hair dryers, heating pads, electric blankets, heated water beds, etc., while wearing the patch. When heat is applied to Daytrana after patch application, both the rate and extent of absorption are significantly increased. The temperature-dependent increase in methylphenidate absorption can be greater than 2-fold [  see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  . This increased absorption can be clinically significant and can result in overdose of methylphenidate [   see Overdosage (10)  ]  .

    5.11 Hematologic Monitoring

  Periodic CBC, differential, and platelet counts are advised during prolonged therapy.
