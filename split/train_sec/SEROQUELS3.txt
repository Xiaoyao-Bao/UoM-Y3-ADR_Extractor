   5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

   EXCERPT:    *     Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions: Increased incidence of cerebrovascular adverse events (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack) has been seen in elderly patients with dementia-related psychoses treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs  (5.3)   
 *     Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS): Manage with immediate discontinuation and close monitoring  (5.4)   
 *    *  ∘  Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus: Monitor patients for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Monitor glucose regularly in patients with diabetes or at risk for diabetes 
 *  ∘  Dyslipidemia: Undesirable alterations have been observed in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. Appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended, including fasting blood lipid testing at the beginning of, and periodically, during treatment 
 *  ∘  Weight Gain: Gain in body weight has been observed; clinical monitoring of weight is recommended 
    Metabolic Changes: Atypical antipsychotics have been associated with metabolic changes. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and weight gain  (5.5)   
 *     Tardive Dyskinesia: Discontinue if clinically appropriate  (5.6)   
 *     Hypotension: Use with caution in patients with known cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease  (5.7)   
 *     Increased Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents: Monitor blood pressure at the beginning of, and periodically during treatment in children and adolescents  (5.9)   
 *     Leukopenia, Neutropenia and Agranulocytosis: Monitor complete blood count frequently during the first few months of treatment in patients with a pre-existing low white cell count or a history of leukopenia/neutropenia and discontinue SEROQUEL at the first sign of a decline in WBC in absence of other causative factors  (5.10)   
 *     Cataracts: Lens changes have been observed in patients during long-term quetiapine treatment. Lens examination is recommended when starting treatment and at 6-month intervals during chronic treatment  (5.11)   
    
 

   5.1 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis

  Elderly patients with  dementia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  related≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   psychosis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of  death≠B-NonOSE_AE . Analysis of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of  death≠B-NonOSE_AE  in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of  death≠B-NonOSE_AE  in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of  death≠B-NonOSE_AE  in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of  death≠B-NonOSE_AE  were varied, most of the  deaths≠B-NonOSE_AE  appeared to be either  cardiovascular≠I-NonOSE_AE  (e.g.,  heart≠B-NonOSE_AE   failure≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  sudden≠B-NonOSE_AE   death≠I-NonOSE_AE ) or  infectious≠B-NonOSE_AE  (e.g.,  pneumonia≠B-NonOSE_AE ) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase  mortality≠B-NonOSE_AE . The extent to which the findings of increased  mortality≠B-NonOSE_AE  in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. SEROQUEL is not approved for the treatment of patients with  dementia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  related≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   psychosis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  [ see Boxed Warning  ].

    5.2 Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Adolescents and Young Adults

  Patients with  major≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depressive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   (≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  MDD≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ), both adult and pediatric, may experience  worsening≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   their≠I-NonOSE_AE   depression≠I-NonOSE_AE  and/or the emergence of  suicidal≠B-NonOSE_AE   ideation≠I-NonOSE_AE  and behavior ( suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE ) or  unusual≠B-NonOSE_AE   changes≠I-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   behavior≠I-NonOSE_AE , whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs.  Suicide≠B-NonOSE_AE  is a known risk of  depression≠B-NonOSE_AE  and certain other  psychiatric≠B-NonOSE_AE   disorders≠I-NonOSE_AE , and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of  suicide≠B-NonOSE_AE . There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing  worsening≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   depression≠I-NonOSE_AE  and the emergence of  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE  in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of  suicidal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  thinking and  behavior≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  ( suicidality≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18-24) with  major≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depressive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   (≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  MDD≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ) and other  psychiatric≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorders≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE  with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.

 The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with  MDD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ,  obsessive≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  compulsive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   (≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  OCD≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ), or other  psychiatric≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorders≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with  MDD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or other  psychiatric≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorders≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE  among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE  across the different indications, with the highest incidence in  MDD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate . The risk differences (drug vs. placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE  per 1000 patients treated) are provided in Table 2.

 Table 2: Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Cases of Suicidality per 1000 Patients Treated 
  Age Range      Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Cases of  Suicidality≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  per 1000 Patients Treated     
                  Increases≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  Compared to Placebo                                                           
  <18            14 additional cases                                                                     
  18-24          5 additional cases                                                                      
                 Decreases Compared to Placebo                                                           
  25-64          1 fewer case                                                                            
  >=65           6 fewer cases                                                                           
        No  suicides≠B-NonOSE_AE  occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were  suicides≠B-NonOSE_AE  in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on  suicide≠B-NonOSE_AE .
 

 It is unknown whether the  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE  risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with  depression≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of  depression≠B-NonOSE_AE .

  All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening,  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE , and  unusual≠B-NonOSE_AE   changes≠I-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   behavior≠I-NonOSE_AE , especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases.  

 The following symptoms,  anxiety≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  agitation≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  panic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   attacks≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  insomnia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  irritability≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  hostility≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  aggressiveness≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  impulsivity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  akathisia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  ( psychomotor≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   restlessness≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ),  hypomania≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  mania≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for  major≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depressive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the  worsening≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   depression≠I-NonOSE_AE  and/or the emergence of  suicidal≠B-NonOSE_AE   impulses≠I-NonOSE_AE  has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE .

 Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose  depression≠B-NonOSE_AE   is≠I-NonOSE_AE   persistently≠I-NonOSE_AE   worse≠I-NonOSE_AE , or who are experiencing emergent  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE  or symptoms that might be precursors to  worsening≠B-NonOSE_AE   depression≠I-NonOSE_AE  or  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE , especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.

  Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for  major≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depressive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of  agitation≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  irritability≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  unusual≠B-NonOSE_AE   changes≠I-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   behavior≠I-NonOSE_AE , and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE , and to report such symptoms immediately to healthcare providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers.  Prescriptions for SEROQUEL should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of  overdose≠B-NonOSE_AE .

  Screening Patients for  Bipolar≠B-NonOSE_AE   Disorder≠I-NonOSE_AE :  A  major≠B-NonOSE_AE   depressive≠I-NonOSE_AE   episode≠I-NonOSE_AE  may be the initial presentation of  bipolar≠B-NonOSE_AE   disorder≠I-NonOSE_AE . It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of  precipitation≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   a≠I-NonOSE_AE   mixed≠I-NonOSE_AE  /≠I-NonOSE_AE  manic≠I-NonOSE_AE   episode≠I-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   patients≠I-NonOSE_AE   at≠I-NonOSE_AE   risk≠I-NonOSE_AE   for≠I-NonOSE_AE   bipolar≠I-NonOSE_AE   disorder≠I-NonOSE_AE . Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, including SEROQUEL, patients with  depressive≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   symptoms≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for  bipolar≠B-NonOSE_AE   disorder≠I-NonOSE_AE ; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of  suicide≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ,  bipolar≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , and  depression≠B-Not_AE_Candidate .

    5.3 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions, Including Stroke, in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis

  In placebo-controlled trials with risperidone, aripiprazole, and olanzapine in elderly subjects with  dementia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , there was a higher incidence of  cerebrovascular≠B-NonOSE_AE   adverse≠I-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE  ( cerebrovascular≠B-NonOSE_AE   accidents≠I-NonOSE_AE  and  transient≠B-NonOSE_AE   ischemic≠I-NonOSE_AE   attacks≠I-NonOSE_AE ) including  fatalities≠B-NonOSE_AE  compared to placebo-treated subjects. SEROQUEL is not approved for the treatment of patients with  dementia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  related≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   psychosis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  [see also Boxed Warning and  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ].  

    5.4 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)

  A potentially  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE  symptom complex sometimes referred to as  Neuroleptic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   Malignant≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   Syndrome≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  NMS≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ) has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs, including SEROQUEL. Rare cases of  NMS≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported with SEROQUEL. Clinical manifestations of  NMS≠B-NonOSE_AE  are  hyperpyrexia≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  muscle≠B-NonOSE_AE   rigidity≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  altered≠B-NonOSE_AE   mental≠I-NonOSE_AE   status≠I-NonOSE_AE , and evidence of  autonomic≠B-NonOSE_AE   instability≠I-NonOSE_AE  ( irregular≠B-NonOSE_AE  pulse or  blood≠I-NonOSE_AE   pressure≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  tachycardia≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  diaphoresis≠B-NonOSE_AE , and  cardiac≠B-NonOSE_AE   dysrhythmia≠I-NonOSE_AE ). Additional signs may include  elevated≠B-NonOSE_AE   creatinine≠I-NonOSE_AE   phosphokinase≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  myoglobinuria≠B-NonOSE_AE  ( rhabdomyolysis≠B-NonOSE_AE ) and  acute≠B-NonOSE_AE   renal≠I-NonOSE_AE   failure≠I-NonOSE_AE .

 The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to exclude cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g.,  pneumonia≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  systemic≠B-NonOSE_AE   infection≠I-NonOSE_AE , etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated  extrapyramidal≠B-NonOSE_AE   signs≠I-NonOSE_AE   and≠I-NonOSE_AE   symptoms≠I-NonOSE_AE   (≠I-NonOSE_AE  EPS≠I-NonOSE_AE ). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include  central≠B-NonOSE_AE   anticholinergic≠I-NonOSE_AE   toxicity≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  heat≠B-NonOSE_AE   stroke≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  drug≠B-NonOSE_AE   fever≠I-NonOSE_AE  and  primary≠B-NonOSE_AE   central≠I-NonOSE_AE   nervous≠I-NonOSE_AE   system≠I-NonOSE_AE   (≠I-NonOSE_AE  CNS≠I-NonOSE_AE  )≠I-NonOSE_AE   pathology≠I-NonOSE_AE .

 The management of  NMS≠B-NonOSE_AE  should include: 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy; 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring; and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for  NMS≠B-NonOSE_AE .

 If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from  NMS≠B-NonOSE_AE , the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored since recurrences of  NMS≠B-NonOSE_AE  have been reported.

    5.5 Metabolic Changes

  Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with  metabolic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   changes≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  that include  hyperglycemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE / diabetes≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   mellitus≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  dyslipidemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  body≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   weight≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   gain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . While all of the drugs in the class have been shown to produce some  metabolic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   changes≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , each drug has its own specific risk profile. In some patients, a  worsening≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE  more than one of the metabolic parameters of  weight≠I-NonOSE_AE , blood glucose, and lipids was observed in clinical studies.  Changes≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   these≠I-NonOSE_AE   metabolic≠I-NonOSE_AE  profiles should be managed as clinically appropriate.

  Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus  

  Hyperglycemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , in some cases extreme and associated with  ketoacidosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  or  hyperosmolar≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   coma≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  or  death≠B-NonOSE_AE , has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including quetiapine. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and  glucose≠B-NonOSE_AE   abnormalities≠I-NonOSE_AE  is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of  diabetes≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   mellitus≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  in patients with  schizophrenia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and the increasing incidence of  diabetes≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   mellitus≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and  hyperglycemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  related≠I-NonOSE_AE   adverse≠I-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE  is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent  hyperglycemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  related≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   adverse≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for  hyperglycemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  related≠I-NonOSE_AE   adverse≠I-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE  in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available.

 Patients with an established diagnosis of  diabetes≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   mellitus≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  who are started on atypical antipsychotics should be monitored regularly for  worsening≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   glucose≠I-NonOSE_AE   control≠I-NonOSE_AE . Patients with risk factors for  diabetes≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   mellitus≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  (e.g.,  obesity≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ,  family≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   history≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   of≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   diabetes≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of  hyperglycemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  including  polydipsia≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  polyuria≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  polyphagia≠B-NonOSE_AE , and  weakness≠B-NonOSE_AE . Patients who develop symptoms of  hyperglycemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases,  hyperglycemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug.

 In 2 long-term placebo-controlled randomized withdrawal clinical trials for  bipolar≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   I≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  maintenance, mean exposure of 213 days for SEROQUEL (646 patients) and 152 days for placebo (680 patients), the  mean≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   change≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   glucose≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   from≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   baseline≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  was +5.0 mg/dL for SEROQUEL and -0.05 mg/dL for placebo. The exposure-adjusted rate of any  increased≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   blood≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   glucose≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   level≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (>= 126 mg/dL) for patients more than 8 hours since a meal (however, some patients may not have been precluded from calorie intake from fluids during fasting period) was 18.0 per 100 patient years for SEROQUEL (10.7% of patients; n=556) and 9.5 for placebo per 100 patient years (4.6% of patients; n=581).

  Children and Adolescents:

 In an open-label study that enrolled patients from the above two pediatric trials, 63% of patients (241/380) completed 26 weeks of therapy with SEROQUEL. After 26 weeks of treatment, the mean  increase≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   body≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   weight≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  was 4.4 kg.

In order to adjust for normal growth over 26 weeks an increase of at least 0.5 standard deviation from baseline in BMI was used as a measure of a clinically significant change; 18.3% of patients on SEROQUEL met this criterion after 26 weeks of treatment.

 In a clinical trial for SEROQUEL XR in children and adolescents (10-17 years of age) with  bipolar≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depression≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , in which efficacy was not established, the percentage of patients with  weight≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   gain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  >=7% of body weight at any time was 15% (14/92) for SEROQUEL XR vs. 10% (10/100) for placebo.

 When treating pediatric patients with SEROQUEL for any indication,  weight≠B-NonOSE_AE   gain≠I-NonOSE_AE  should be assessed against that expected for normal growth.

    5.6  Tardive≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   Dyskinesia≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE 

  A syndrome of potentially irreversible, involuntary,  dyskinetic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   movements≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including quetiapine. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause  tardive≠B-NonOSE_AE   dyskinesia≠I-NonOSE_AE  is unknown.

 The risk of developing  tardive≠B-NonOSE_AE   dyskinesia≠I-NonOSE_AE  and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses or may even arise after discontinuation of treatment.

 There is no known treatment for established cases of  tardive≠B-NonOSE_AE   dyskinesia≠I-NonOSE_AE , although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.

 Given these considerations, SEROQUEL should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of  tardive≠B-NonOSE_AE   dyskinesia≠I-NonOSE_AE . Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who appear to suffer from a chronic illness that (1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.

 If signs and symptoms of  tardive≠B-NonOSE_AE   dyskinesia≠I-NonOSE_AE  appear in a patient on SEROQUEL, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with SEROQUEL despite the presence of the syndrome.

    5.7 Hypotension

  Quetiapine may induce  orthostatic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   hypotension≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  associated with  dizziness≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  tachycardia≠B-NonOSE_AE  and, in some patients,  syncope≠B-NonOSE_AE , especially during the initial dose-titration period, probably reflecting its alpha1-adrenergic antagonist properties.  Syncope≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was reported in 1% (28/3265) of the patients treated with SEROQUEL, compared with 0.2% (2/954) on placebo and about 0.4% (2/527) on active control drugs.  Orthostatic≠B-NonOSE_AE   hypotension≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  dizziness≠B-NonOSE_AE , and  syncope≠B-NonOSE_AE  may lead to  falls≠B-NonOSE_AE .

 SEROQUEL should be used with particular caution in patients with known  cardiovascular≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  (history of  myocardial≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   infarction≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  or  ischemic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   heart≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  heart≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   failure≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  or  conduction≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   abnormalities≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ),  cerebrovascular≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  or conditions which would predispose patients to  hypotension≠B-NonOSE_AE  ( dehydration≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ,  hypovolemia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and treatment with  antihypertensive≠B-NonOSE_AE   medications≠I-NonOSE_AE ). The risk of  orthostatic≠B-NonOSE_AE   hypotension≠I-NonOSE_AE  and  syncope≠B-NonOSE_AE  may be minimized by limiting the initial dose to 25 mg twice daily [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ].  If  hypotension≠B-NonOSE_AE  occurs during titration to the target dose, a return to the previous dose in the titration schedule is appropriate.

     5.8 Falls  

   Atypical antipsychotic drugs, including SEROQUEL, may cause  somnolence≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  postural≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   hypotension≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  motor≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and sensory  instability≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , which may lead to  falls≠B-NonOSE_AE  and, consequently,  fractures≠B-NonOSE_AE  or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete  fall≠B-NonOSE_AE  risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy.  

    5.9 Increases in Blood Pressure (Children and Adolescents)

  In placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with  schizophrenia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  (6-week duration) or  bipolar≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   mania≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  (3-week duration), the incidence of  increases≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  at any time  in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   systolic≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   blood≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   pressure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (>=20 mmHg) was 15.2% (51/335) for SEROQUEL and 5.5% (9/163) for placebo; the incidence of  increases≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  at any time  in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   diastolic≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   blood≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   pressure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (>=10 mmHg) was 40.6% (136/335) for SEROQUEL and 24.5% (40/163) for placebo. In the 26-week open-label clinical trial, one child with a reported history of  hypertension≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  experienced a  hypertensive≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   crisis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . Blood pressure in children and adolescents should be measured at the beginning of, and periodically during treatment.

 In a placebo-controlled SEROQUEL XR clinical trial (8 weeks duration) in children and adolescents (10-17 years of age) with  bipolar≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depression≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , in which efficacy was not established, the incidence of  increases≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  at any time  in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   systolic≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   blood≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   pressure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (>=20 mmHg) was 6.5% (6/92) for SEROQUEL XR and 6.0% (6/100) for placebo; the incidence of  increases≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  at any time  in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   diastolic≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   blood≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   pressure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (>=10 mmHg) was 46.7% (43/92) for SEROQUEL XR and 36.0% (36/100) for placebo.

    5.10 Leukopenia, Neutropenia and Agranulocytosis

  In clinical trial and postmarketing experience, events of  leukopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE / neutropenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported temporally related to atypical antipsychotic agents, including SEROQUEL.  Agranulocytosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (including  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE  cases) has also been reported.

 Possible risk factors for  leukopenia≠B-NonOSE_AE / neutropenia≠B-NonOSE_AE  include pre-existing  low≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   white≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   cell≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   count≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   (≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  WBC≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ) and history of  drug≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  induced≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  leukopenia/ neutropenia≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Patients with a pre-existing  low≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   WBC≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  or a history of  drug≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   induced≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   leukopenia≠I-Not_AE_Candidate /neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and should discontinue SEROQUEL at the first sign of a  decline≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   WBC≠I-NonOSE_AE  in absence of other causative factors.

 Patients with  neutropenia≠B-NonOSE_AE  should be carefully monitored for  fever≠B-NonOSE_AE  or other symptoms or signs of  infection≠B-NonOSE_AE  and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe  neutropenia≠B-NonOSE_AE  ( absolute≠B-NonOSE_AE   neutrophil≠I-NonOSE_AE   count≠I-NonOSE_AE   <≠I-NonOSE_AE  1≠I-NonOSE_AE  0≠I-NonOSE_AE  0≠I-NonOSE_AE  0≠I-NonOSE_AE  /≠I-NonOSE_AE  mm≠I-NonOSE_AE    3≠I-NonOSE_AE   ) should discontinue SEROQUEL and have their WBC followed until recovery.

    5.11 Cataracts

  The development of  cataracts≠B-NonOSE_AE  was observed in association with quetiapine treatment in chronic dog studies [see  Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)  ].   Lens≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   changes≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  have also been observed in adults, children and adolescents during long-term SEROQUEL treatment, but a causal relationship to SEROQUEL use has not been established. Nevertheless, the possibility of  lenticular≠B-NonOSE_AE   changes≠I-NonOSE_AE  cannot be excluded at this time. Therefore, examination of the lens by methods adequate to detect  cataract≠B-NonOSE_AE   formation≠I-NonOSE_AE , such as slit lamp exam or other appropriately sensitive methods, is recommended at initiation of treatment or shortly thereafter, and at 6-month intervals during chronic treatment.

    5.12 QT Prolongation

  In clinical trials, quetiapine was not associated with a persistent  increase≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   QT≠I-NonOSE_AE   intervals≠I-NonOSE_AE . However, the QT effect was not systematically evaluated in a thorough QT study. In post marketing experience, there were cases reported of  QT≠B-NonOSE_AE   prolongation≠I-NonOSE_AE  in patients who overdosed on quetiapine [see  Overdosage (10.1)  ],  in patients with concomitant illness, and in patients taking medicines known to cause  electrolyte≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   imbalance≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  or  increase≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   QT≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   interval≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  [see  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ]  .

 The use of quetiapine should be avoided in combination with other drugs that are known to  prolong≠B-NonOSE_AE   QTc≠I-NonOSE_AE  including Class 1A antiarrythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), antipsychotic medications (e.g., ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine), antibiotics (e.g., gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin), or any other class of medications known to  prolong≠B-NonOSE_AE   the≠I-NonOSE_AE   QTc≠I-NonOSE_AE   interval≠I-NonOSE_AE  (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone).

 Quetiapine should also be avoided in circumstances that may increase the risk of occurrence of  torsade≠B-NonOSE_AE   de≠I-NonOSE_AE   pointes≠I-NonOSE_AE  and/or  sudden≠B-NonOSE_AE   death≠I-NonOSE_AE  including (1) a history of  cardiac≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   arrhythmias≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  such as  bradycardia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ; (2)  hypokalemia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or  hypomagnesemia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ; (3) concomitant use of other drugs that  prolong≠B-NonOSE_AE   the≠I-NonOSE_AE   QTc≠I-NonOSE_AE   interval≠I-NonOSE_AE ; and (4) presence of  congenital≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   prolongation≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   of≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   the≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   QT≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   interval≠I-Not_AE_Candidate .

 Caution should also be exercised when quetiapine is prescribed in patients with increased risk of  QT≠B-NonOSE_AE   prolongation≠I-NonOSE_AE  (e.g.,  cardiovascular≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , family history of  QT≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   prolongation≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , the elderly,  congestive≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   heart≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   failure≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and  heart≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   hypertrophy≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ).

    5.13 Seizures

  During clinical trials,  seizures≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred in 0.5% (20/3490) of patients treated with SEROQUEL compared to 0.2% (2/954) on placebo and 0.7% (4/527) on active control drugs. As with other antipsychotics, SEROQUEL should be used cautiously in patients with a history of  seizures≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or with conditions that potentially  lower≠B-NonOSE_AE   the≠I-NonOSE_AE   seizure≠I-NonOSE_AE   threshold≠I-NonOSE_AE , e.g.,  Alzheimer≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  s≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   dementia≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Conditions that  lower≠B-NonOSE_AE   the≠I-NonOSE_AE   seizure≠I-NonOSE_AE   threshold≠I-NonOSE_AE  may be more prevalent in a population of 65 years or older.

    5.14  Hypothyroidism≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE 

  Adults: Clinical trials with quetiapine demonstrated dose-related  decreases≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   thyroid≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   hormone≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   levels≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . The  reduction≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  in total and  free≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   thyroxine≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  T≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  4≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ) of approximately 20% at the higher end of the therapeutic dose range was maximal in the first six weeks of treatment and maintained without adaptation or progression during more chronic therapy. In nearly all cases, cessation of quetiapine treatment was associated with a reversal of the effects on total and free T4, irrespective of the duration of treatment. The mechanism by which quetiapine effects the thyroid axis is unclear. If there is an effect on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, measurement of TSH alone may not accurately reflect a patient's thyroid status. Therefore, both TSH and free T4, in addition to clinical assessment, should be measured at baseline and at follow-up.

 In the  mania≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  adjunct studies, where SEROQUEL was added to lithium or divalproex, 12% (24/196) of SEROQUEL treated patients compared to 7% (15/203) of placebo-treated patients had  elevated≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   TSH≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   levels≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . Of the SEROQUEL treated patients with  elevated≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   TSH≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   levels≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , 3 had simultaneous  low≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   free≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   T≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  4≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  levels≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (free T4<0.8 LLN).

 About 0.7% (26/3489) of SEROQUEL patients did experience  TSH≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   increases≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  in monotherapy studies. Some patients with  TSH≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   increases≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  needed replacement thyroid treatment.

 In all quetiapine trials, the incidence of significant  shifts≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   thyroid≠I-NonOSE_AE   hormones≠I-NonOSE_AE  and TSH were [note: Based on shifts from normal baseline to potentially clinically important value at any time post-baseline.  Shifts≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   total≠I-NonOSE_AE   T≠I-NonOSE_AE  4≠I-NonOSE_AE , free T4, total T3and free T3are defined as M0.8 x LLN (pmol/L) and  shift≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   TSH≠I-NonOSE_AE  is > 5 mlU/L at any time.] :  decrease≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   free≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   T≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  4≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE (free T4<0.8 LLN), 2.0% (357/17513);  decrease≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   total≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   T≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  4≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , 4.0% (75/1861);  decrease≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   free≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   T≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  3≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , 0.4% (53/13766);  decrease≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   total≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   T≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  3≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , 2.0% (26/1312), and  increase≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   TSH≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , 4.9% (956/19412). In eight patients, where TBG was measured, levels of TBG were unchanged.

 Table 8 shows the incidence of these shifts in short-term placebo-controlled clinical trials.

Shifts in  total≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   T≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  4≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , free T4, total T3 and free T3 are defined as <0.8 x LLN (pmol/L) and  shift≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   TSH≠I-NonOSE_AE  is >5 mlU/L at any time., Includes SEROQUEL and SEROQUEL XR data.

                In short-term placebo-controlled monotherapy trials, the incidence of reciprocal, shifts in T3and TSH was 0.0 % for both quetiapine (1/4800) and placebo (0/2190) and for T4and TSH the shifts were 0.1% (7/6154) for quetiapine versus 0.0% (1/3007) for placebo.
 

  Children and Adolescents:  

 In acute placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescent patients with  schizophrenia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  (6-week duration) or  bipolar≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   mania≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  (3-week duration), the incidence of shifts for thyroid function values at any time for SEROQUEL treated patients and placebo-treated patients for  elevated≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   TSH≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  was 2.9% (8/280) vs. 0.7% (1/138), respectively and for  decreased≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   total≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   thyroxine≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  was 2.8% (8/289) vs. 0% (0/145, respectively). Of the SEROQUEL treated patients with  elevated≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   TSH≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  levels, 1 had simultaneous  low≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   free≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   T≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  4≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE level at end of treatment.

    5.15  Hyperprolactinemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE 

   Adults  : During clinical trials with quetiapine, the incidence of  shifts≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   prolactin≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   levels≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   to≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   a≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   clinically≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   significant≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   value≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred in 3.6% (158/4416) of patients treated with quetiapine compared to 2.6% (51/1968) on placebo.

  Children and Adolescents:  

 In acute placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescent patients with  bipolar≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   mania≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  (3-week duration) or  schizophrenia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  (6-week duration), the incidence of  shifts≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   prolactin≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   levels≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   to≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   a≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   value≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  >≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  2≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  0≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   ug≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  /≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  L≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  males; > 26 ug/L females at any time) was 13.4% (18/134) for SEROQUEL compared to 4% (3/75) for placebo in males and 8.7% (9/104) for SEROQUEL compared to 0% (0/39) for placebo in females.

 Like other drugs that antagonize dopamine D2receptors, SEROQUEL  elevates≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   prolactin≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   levels≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  in some patients and the elevation may persist during chronic administration.  Hyperprolactinemia≠B-NonOSE_AE , regardless of etiology, may  suppress≠B-NonOSE_AE   hypothalamic≠I-NonOSE_AE   GnRH≠I-NonOSE_AE , resulting in  reduced≠B-NonOSE_AE   pituitary≠I-NonOSE_AE   gonadotrophin≠I-NonOSE_AE   secretion≠I-NonOSE_AE . This, in turn, may  inhibit≠B-NonOSE_AE   reproductive≠I-NonOSE_AE   function≠I-NonOSE_AE  by  impairing≠B-NonOSE_AE   gonadal≠I-NonOSE_AE   steroidogenesis≠I-NonOSE_AE  in both female and male patients.  Galactorrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  amenorrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  gynecomastia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  impotence≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported in patients receiving  prolactin≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  elevating≠I-NonOSE_AE  compounds. Long-standing  hyperprolactinemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  when associated with  hypogonadism≠B-NonOSE_AE  may lead to  decreased≠B-NonOSE_AE   bone≠I-NonOSE_AE   density≠I-NonOSE_AE  in both female and male subjects.

 Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human  breast≠B-NonOSE_AE   cancers≠I-NonOSE_AE  are prolactin dependent in vitro  , a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is considered in a patient with previously detected  breast≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . As is common with compounds which  increase≠B-NonOSE_AE   prolactin≠I-NonOSE_AE  release,  mammary≠B-NonOSE_AE   gland≠I-NonOSE_AE , and pancreatic islet cell  neoplasia≠I-NonOSE_AE  ( mammary≠B-NonOSE_AE   adenocarcinomas≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  pituitary≠B-NonOSE_AE  and pancreatic  adenomas≠I-NonOSE_AE ) was observed in  carcinogenicity≠B-NonOSE_AE  studies conducted in mice and rats. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration of this class of drugs and  tumorigenesis≠B-NonOSE_AE  in humans, but the available evidence is too limited to be conclusive [see  Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)  ].  

    5.16 Potential for  Cognitive≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and Motor  Impairment≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE 

   Somnolence≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was a commonly reported adverse event reported in patients treated with SEROQUEL especially during the 3-5 day period of initial dose-titration. In  schizophrenia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  trials,  somnolence≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was reported in 18% (89/510) of patients on SEROQUEL compared to 11% (22/206) of placebo patients. In acute  bipolar≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   mania≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  trials using SEROQUEL as monotherapy,  somnolence≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was reported in 16% (34/209) of patients on SEROQUEL compared to 4% of placebo patients. In acute  bipolar≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   mania≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  trials using SEROQUEL as adjunct therapy,  somnolence≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was reported in 34% (66/196) of patients on SEROQUEL compared to 9% (19/203) of placebo patients. In  bipolar≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depression≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  trials,  somnolence≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was reported in 57% (398/698) of patients on SEROQUEL compared to 15% (51/347) of placebo patients. Since SEROQUEL has the potential to  impair≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  judgment, thinking, or  motor≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   skills≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , patients should be cautioned about performing activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle (including automobiles) or operating hazardous machinery until they are reasonably certain that SEROQUEL therapy does not affect them adversely.  Somnolence≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  may lead to  falls≠B-NonOSE_AE .

    5.17 Body Temperature Regulation

  Although not reported with SEROQUEL,  disruption≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   the≠I-NonOSE_AE   body≠I-NonOSE_AE  '≠I-NonOSE_AE  s≠I-NonOSE_AE   ability≠I-NonOSE_AE   to≠I-NonOSE_AE   reduce≠I-NonOSE_AE   core≠I-NonOSE_AE   body≠I-NonOSE_AE   temperature≠I-NonOSE_AE  has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Appropriate care is advised when prescribing SEROQUEL for patients who will be experiencing conditions which may contribute to an  elevation≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   core≠I-NonOSE_AE   body≠I-NonOSE_AE   temperature≠I-NonOSE_AE , e.g., exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medication with anticholinergic activity, or being subject to  dehydration≠B-NonOSE_AE .

    5.18  Dysphagia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE 

   Esophageal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   dysmotility≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  aspiration≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been associated with antipsychotic drug use.  Aspiration≠B-NonOSE_AE   pneumonia≠I-NonOSE_AE  is a common cause of morbidity and  mortality≠B-NonOSE_AE  in elderly patients, in particular those with advanced  Alzheimer≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  s≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   dementia≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . SEROQUEL and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for  aspiration≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   pneumonia≠I-Not_AE_Candidate .

   Acute≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   withdrawal≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   symptoms≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , such as  insomnia≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  nausea≠B-NonOSE_AE , and  vomiting≠B-NonOSE_AE  have been described after abrupt cessation of atypical antipsychotic drugs, including SEROQUEL. In short-term placebo-controlled, monotherapy clinical trials with SEROQUEL XR that included a discontinuation phase which evaluated  discontinuation≠B-NonOSE_AE   symptoms≠I-NonOSE_AE , the aggregated incidence of patients experiencing one or more  discontinuation≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   symptoms≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  after abrupt cessation was 12.1% (241/1993) for SEROQUEL XR and 6.7% (71/1065) for placebo. The incidence of the individual adverse events (i.e.,  insomnia≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  nausea≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  headache≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  diarrhea≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  vomiting≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  dizziness≠B-NonOSE_AE  and  irritability≠B-NonOSE_AE ) did not exceed 5.3% in any treatment group and usually resolved after 1 week post-discontinuation.
