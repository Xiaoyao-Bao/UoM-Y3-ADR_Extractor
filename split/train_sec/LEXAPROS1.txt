  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

     Clinical Trial Data Sources  

     Pediatrics (6 -17 years)  

 Adverse events were collected in 576 pediatric patients (286 Lexapro, 290 placebo) with  major≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depressive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  in double-blind placebo-controlled studies. Safety and effectiveness of Lexapro in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age has not been established.

     Adults  

 Adverse events information for Lexapro was collected from 715 patients with  major≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depressive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  who were exposed to escitalopram and from 592 patients who were exposed to placebo in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. An additional 284 patients with  major≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depressive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  were newly exposed to escitalopram in open-label trials. The adverse event information for Lexapro in patients with  GAD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  was collected from 429 patients exposed to escitalopram and from 427 patients exposed to placebo in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials.

 Adverse events during exposure were obtained primarily by general inquiry and recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tables and tabulations that follow, standard World Health Organization (WHO) terminology has been used to classify reported adverse events.

 The stated frequencies of adverse reactions represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatment-emergent adverse event of the type listed. An event was considered treatment-emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation.

     Adverse Events Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment  

      Major≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   Depressive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   Disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   

     Pediatrics (6 -17 years)  

 Adverse events were associated with discontinuation of 3.5% of 286 patients receiving Lexapro and 1% of 290 patients receiving placebo. The most common adverse event (incidence at least 1% for Lexapro and greater than placebo) associated with discontinuation was  insomnia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (1% Lexapro, 0% placebo).

     Adults  

 Among the 715  depressed≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  patients who received Lexapro in placebo-controlled trials, 6% discontinued treatment due to an adverse event, as compared to 2% of 592 patients receiving placebo. In two fixed-dose studies, the rate of discontinuation for adverse events in patients receiving 10 mg/day Lexapro was not significantly different from the rate of discontinuation for adverse events in patients receiving placebo. The rate of discontinuation for adverse events in patients assigned to a fixed dose of 20 mg/day Lexapro was 10%, which was significantly different from the rate of discontinuation for adverse events in patients receiving 10 mg/day Lexapro (4%) and placebo (3%). Adverse events that were associated with the discontinuation of at least 1% of patients treated with Lexapro, and for which the rate was at least twice that of placebo, were  nausea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (2%) and  ejaculation≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   disorder≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (2% of male patients).

      Generalized≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   Anxiety≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   Disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   

     Adults  

 Among the 429  GAD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  patients who received Lexapro 10-20 mg/day in placebo-controlled trials, 8% discontinued treatment due to an adverse event, as compared to 4% of 427 patients receiving placebo. Adverse events that were associated with the discontinuation of at least 1% of patients treated with Lexapro, and for which the rate was at least twice the placebo rate, were  nausea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (2%),  insomnia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (1%), and  fatigue≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (1%).

     Incidence of Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials  

      Major≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   Depressive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   Disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   

     Pediatrics (6 -17 years)  

 The overall profile of adverse reactions in pediatric patients was generally similar to that seen in adult studies, as shown in  Table 2  . However, the following adverse reactions (excluding those which appear in  Table 2  and those for which the coded terms were uninformative or misleading) were reported at an incidence of at least 2% for Lexapro and greater than placebo:  back≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  urinary≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   tract≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infection≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  vomiting≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  nasal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   congestion≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE .

     Adults  

 The most commonly observed adverse reactions in Lexapro patients (incidence of approximately 5% or greater and approximately twice the incidence in placebo patients) were  insomnia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  ejaculation≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   disorder≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (primarily  ejaculatory≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   delay≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ),  nausea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  sweating≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   increased≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  fatigue≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  somnolence≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .

   Table 2  enumerates the incidence, rounded to the nearest percent, of treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred among 715  depressed≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  patients who received Lexapro at doses ranging from 10 to 20 mg/day in placebo-controlled trials. Events included are those occurring in 2% or more of patients treated with Lexapro and for which the incidence in patients treated with Lexapro was greater than the incidence in placebo-treated patients.

             Dose Dependency of Adverse Reactions  
 

 The potential dose dependency of common adverse reactions (defined as an incidence rate of >=5% in either the 10 mg or 20 mg Lexapro groups) was examined on the basis of the combined incidence of adverse reactions in two fixed-dose trials. The overall incidence rates of adverse events in 10 mg Lexapro-treated patients (66%) was similar to that of the placebo-treated patients (61%), while the incidence rate in 20 mg/day Lexapro-treated patients was greater (86%).  Table 4  shows common adverse reactions that occurred in the 20 mg/day Lexapro group with an incidence that was approximately twice that of the 10 mg/day Lexapro group and approximately twice that of the placebo group.

              Male and Female Sexual Dysfunction with SSRIs  
 

 Although  changes≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   sexual≠I-NonOSE_AE   desire≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  sexual≠B-NonOSE_AE   performance≠I-NonOSE_AE , and  sexual≠B-NonOSE_AE   satisfaction≠I-NonOSE_AE  often occur as manifestations of a  psychiatric≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , they may also be a consequence of pharmacologic treatment. In particular, some evidence suggests that SSRIs can cause such  untoward≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   sexual≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   experiences≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE .

 Reliable estimates of the incidence and severity of  untoward≠B-NonOSE_AE   experiences≠I-NonOSE_AE   involving≠I-NonOSE_AE   sexual≠I-NonOSE_AE  desire, performance, and  satisfaction≠I-NonOSE_AE  are difficult to obtain, however, in part because patients and physicians may be reluctant to discuss them. Accordingly, estimates of the incidence of  untoward≠B-NonOSE_AE   sexual≠I-NonOSE_AE  experience and  performance≠I-NonOSE_AE  cited in product labeling are likely to underestimate their actual incidence.

 While it is difficult to know the precise risk of  sexual≠B-NonOSE_AE   dysfunction≠I-NonOSE_AE  associated with the use of SSRIs, physicians should routinely inquire about such possible side effects.

     Vital Sign Changes  

 Lexapro and placebo groups were compared with respect to (1) mean change from baseline in vital signs (pulse, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure) and (2) the incidence of patients meeting criteria for potentially clinically significant changes from baseline in these variables. These analyses did not reveal any clinically important changes in vital signs associated with Lexapro treatment. In addition, a comparison of supine and standing vital sign measures in subjects receiving Lexapro indicated that Lexapro treatment is not associated with  orthostatic≠B-NonOSE_AE   changes≠I-NonOSE_AE .

     Weight Changes

     Laboratory Changes  

 Lexapro and placebo groups were compared with respect to (1) mean change from baseline in various serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis variables, and (2) the incidence of patients meeting criteria for potentially clinically significant changes from baseline in these variables. These analyses revealed no clinically important  changes≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   laboratory≠I-NonOSE_AE   test≠I-NonOSE_AE  parameters associated with Lexapro treatment.

      ECG≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   Changes≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   

 Electrocardiograms from Lexapro (N=625) and placebo (N=527) groups were compared with respect to outliers defined as subjects with  QTc≠B-NonOSE_AE   changes≠I-NonOSE_AE   over≠I-NonOSE_AE   6≠I-NonOSE_AE  0≠I-NonOSE_AE   msec≠I-NonOSE_AE   from≠I-NonOSE_AE   baseline≠I-NonOSE_AE  or absolute values over 500 msec post-dose, and subjects with  heart≠B-NonOSE_AE   rate≠I-NonOSE_AE   increases≠I-NonOSE_AE  to over 100 bpm or decreases to less than 50 bpm with a 25% change from baseline ( tachycardic≠B-NonOSE_AE  or  bradycardic≠B-NonOSE_AE  outliers, respectively). None of the patients in the Lexapro group had a  QTcF≠B-NonOSE_AE   interval≠I-NonOSE_AE   >≠I-NonOSE_AE  5≠I-NonOSE_AE  0≠I-NonOSE_AE  0≠I-NonOSE_AE   msec≠I-NonOSE_AE  or a prolongation >60 msec compared to 0.2% of patients in the placebo group. The incidence of  tachycardic≠B-NonOSE_AE  outliers was 0.2% in the Lexapro and the placebo group. The incidence of  bradycardic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  outliers was 0.5% in the Lexapro group and 0.2% in the placebo group.

 QTcF interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg) controlled cross-over, escalating multiple-dose study in 113 healthy subjects. The maximum mean  (95% upper confidence bound)  difference from placebo arm were 4.5 (6.4) and 10.7 (12.7) msec for 10 mg and supratherapeutic 30 mg escitalopram given once daily, respectively.

Escitalopram 30 mg given once daily resulted in mean Cmaxof 1.7-fold higher than the mean Cmaxfor the maximum recommended therapeutic dose at steady state (20 mg). The exposure under supratherapeutic 30 mg dose is similar to the steady state concentrations expected in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers following a therapeutic dose of 20 mg.

     Other Reactions Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of Lexapro  

 Following is a list of treatment-emergent adverse events, as defined in the introduction to the    ADVERSE REACTIONS    section, reported by the 1428 patients treated with Lexapro for periods of up to one year in double-blind or open-label clinical trials during its premarketing evaluation. The listing does not include those events already listed in    Tables 2  &  3    , those events for which a drug cause was remote and at a rate less than 1% or lower than placebo, those events which were so general as to be uninformative, and those events reported only once which did not have a substantial probability of being acutely life threatening. Events are categorized by body system. Events of major clinical importance are described in the Warnings and Precautions section (  5  ).

   6.2 Post-Marketing Experience

    Adverse Reactions Reported Subsequent to the Marketing of Escitalopram  

 The following additional adverse reactions have been identified from spontaneous reports of escitalopram received worldwide. These adverse reactions have been chosen for inclusion because of a combination of seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to escitalopram and have not been listed elsewhere in labeling. However, because these adverse reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
