    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *   Gastrointestinal perforation : Consider the overall risk benefit in patients with known or suspected lesions of the GI tract. Monitor for severe, persistent or worsening abdominal pain; discontinue if development of symptoms (  5.1  ) 
 *   Severe or persistent diarrhea : Discontinue if severe or persistent diarrhea occurs during treatment (  5.2  ) 
 *   Opioid withdrawal : Consider the overall risk benefit in patients with disruptions to the blood-brain barrier. Monitor closely for symptoms of opioid withdrawal (  5.3  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Gastrointestinal Perforation



   Cases of  gastrointestinal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   perforation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported in adult patients with  opioid≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  induced≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   constipation≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and advanced illness with conditions that may be associated with localized or diffuse  reduction≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   of≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   structural≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   integrity≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   in≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   the≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   wall≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   of≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   the≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   gastrointestinal≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   tract≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  (e.g.,  peptic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   ulcer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  Ogilvie≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  s≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   syndrome≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  diverticular≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  infiltrative≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   gastrointestinal≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   tract≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   malignancies≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  or  peritoneal≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   metastases≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ). Take into account the overall risk-benefit profile when using RELISTOR in patients with these conditions or other conditions which might result in  impaired≠B-NonOSE_AE   integrity≠I-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   the≠I-NonOSE_AE   gastrointestinal≠I-NonOSE_AE   tract≠I-NonOSE_AE   wall≠I-NonOSE_AE  (e.g.,  Crohn≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  s≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ). Monitor for the development of severe, persistent, or worsening  abdominal≠B-NonOSE_AE   pain≠I-NonOSE_AE ; discontinue RELISTOR in patients who develop this symptom [see Contraindications (  4  )]  .  



    5.2 Severe or Persistent  Diarrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE 



  If severe or persistent  diarrhea≠B-NonOSE_AE  occurs during treatment, advise patients to discontinue therapy with RELISTOR and consult their healthcare provider.



    5.3 Opioid Withdrawal



   Symptoms consistent with  opioid≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   withdrawal≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , including  hyperhidrosis≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  chills≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  diarrhea≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  abdominal≠B-NonOSE_AE   pain≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  anxiety≠B-NonOSE_AE , and  yawning≠B-NonOSE_AE  have occurred in patients treated with RELISTOR [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . Patients having  disruptions≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   to≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   the≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   blood≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  brain≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   barrier≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  may be at increased risk for  opioid≠B-NonOSE_AE   withdrawal≠I-NonOSE_AE  and/or  reduced≠B-NonOSE_AE   analgesia≠I-NonOSE_AE . Take into account the overall risk-benefit profile when using RELISTOR in such patients. Monitor for adequacy of analgesia and symptoms of  opioid≠B-NonOSE_AE   withdrawal≠I-NonOSE_AE  in such patients.
