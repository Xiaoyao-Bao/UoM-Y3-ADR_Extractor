   5.1 Gastrointestinal Perforations and Fistulae

  Serious and sometimes  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE   gastrointestinal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   perforation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  occur at a higher incidence in patients receiving Avastin compared to patients receiving chemotherapy. The incidence ranged from 0.3% to 3% across clinical studies, with the highest incidence in patients with a history of prior pelvic radiation. Perforation can be complicated by  intra≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  abdominal≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   abscess≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  fistula≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   formation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and the need for diverting ostomies. The majority of perforations occurred within 50 days of the first dose.

 Serious  fistulae≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (including, tracheoesophageal, bronchopleural, biliary, vaginal, renal and bladder sites) occur at a higher incidence in patients receiving Avastin compared to patients receiving chemotherapy. The incidence ranged from < 1% to 1.8% across clinical studies, with the highest incidence in patients with  cervical≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . The majority of  fistulae≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred within 6 months of the first dose. Patients who develop a  gastrointestinal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   vaginal≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   fistula≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  may also have a  bowel≠B-NonOSE_AE   obstruction≠I-NonOSE_AE  and require surgical intervention, as well as a diverting ostomy.

 Avoid Avastin in patients with  ovarian≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  who have evidence of  recto≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  sigmoid≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   involvement≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  by pelvic examination or  bowel≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   involvement≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  on CT scan or clinical symptoms of  bowel≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   obstruction≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Discontinue in patients who develop  gastrointestinal≠B-NonOSE_AE   perforation≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  tracheoesophageal≠B-NonOSE_AE   fistula≠I-NonOSE_AE  or any Grade 4  fistula≠B-NonOSE_AE . Discontinue in patients with  fistula≠B-NonOSE_AE   formation≠I-NonOSE_AE   involving≠I-NonOSE_AE   any≠I-NonOSE_AE   internal≠I-NonOSE_AE   organ≠I-NonOSE_AE  [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  

    5.2 Surgery and Wound Healing Complications

  In a controlled clinical study in which Avastin was not administered within 28 days of major surgical procedures, the incidence of  wound≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   healing≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   complications≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , including serious and  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE  complications, was 15% in patients with  mCRC≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  who underwent surgery while receiving Avastin and 4% in patients who did not receive Avastin. In a controlled clinical study in patients with relapsed or recurrent  GBM≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , the incidence of  wound≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   healing≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   events≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  was 5% in patients who received Avastin and 0.7% in patients who did not receive Avastin [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  

 Discontinue Avastin in patients with  wound≠B-NonOSE_AE   healing≠I-NonOSE_AE   complications≠I-NonOSE_AE  requiring medical intervention. Withhold for at least 28 days prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 28 days following surgery and until the wound is fully healed.

  Necrotizing≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   fasciitis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  including  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE  cases, has been reported in patients receiving Avastin, usually secondary to  wound≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   healing≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   complications≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  gastrointestinal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   perforation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  or  fistula≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  formation. Discontinue in patients who develop  necrotizing≠B-NonOSE_AE   fasciitis≠I-NonOSE_AE  [see  Adverse Reactions (6.3)  ].  

    5.3 Hemorrhage

  Avastin can result in two distinct patterns of  bleeding≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE : minor  hemorrhage≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , most commonly Grade 1  epistaxis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ; and serious, and in some cases  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  hemorrhage≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . Severe or  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE   hemorrhage≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , including  hemoptysis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  gastrointestinal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   bleeding≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  hematemesis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  CNS≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   hemorrhage≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  epistaxis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  vaginal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   bleeding≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , occurred up to 5-fold more frequently in patients receiving Avastin compared to patients receiving chemotherapy alone. Across clinical studies, the incidence of Grades 3-5  hemorrhagic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  events ranged from 0.4% to 7% in patients receiving Avastin [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  

 Serious or  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE   pulmonary≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   hemorrhage≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred in 31% of patients with squamous  NSCLC≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and 4% of patients with non-squamous  NSCLC≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  receiving Avastin with chemotherapy compared to none of the patients receiving chemotherapy alone.

 Do not administer Avastin to patients with recent history of  hemoptysis≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  of 1/2 teaspoon or more of red blood. Discontinue in patients who develop a Grade 3-4  hemorrhage≠B-NonOSE_AE .

    5.4 Arterial Thromboembolic Events

  Serious, sometimes  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  arterial≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   thromboembolic≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   events≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  ATE≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ) including  cerebral≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   infarction≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  transient≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   ischemic≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   attacks≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  myocardial≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   infarction≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  angina≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , occurred at a higher incidence in patients receiving Avastin compared to patients receiving chemotherapy. Across clinical studies, the incidence of Grades 3-5 ATE was 5% in patients receiving Avastin with chemotherapy compared to <= 2% in patients receiving chemotherapy alone; the highest incidence occurred in patients with  GBM≠B-Not_AE_Candidate . The risk of developing  ATE≠B-NonOSE_AE  was increased in patients with a history of  arterial≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   thromboembolism≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  diabetes≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , or greater than 65 years old [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.5)  ].  

 Discontinue in patients who develop a severe  ATE≠B-NonOSE_AE . The safety of reinitiating Avastin after an  ATE≠B-NonOSE_AE  is resolved is not known.

    5.5 Venous Thromboembolic Events

  An increased risk of  venous≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   thromboembolic≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   events≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  VTE≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ) was observed across clinical studies. In Study GOG-0240, Grade 3-4  VTE≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was reported in 11% of patients receiving Avastin with chemotherapy compared with 5% of patients receiving chemotherapy alone. In EORTC 26101, the incidence of Grade 3-4  VTE≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was 5% in patients receiving Avastin with chemotherapy compared to 2% in patients receiving chemotherapy alone.

 Discontinue Avastin in patients with a Grade 4  VTE≠B-NonOSE_AE , including  pulmonary≠B-NonOSE_AE   embolism≠I-NonOSE_AE  [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  

    5.6 Hypertension

  The incidence of severe  hypertension≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  is increased in patients receiving Avastin as compared to patients receiving chemotherapy alone. Across clinical studies, the incidence of Grade 3-4  hypertension≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  ranged from 5% to 18%.

 Monitor blood pressure every two to three weeks during treatment with Avastin. Treat with appropriate  anti≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  hypertensive≠I-NonOSE_AE   therapy≠I-NonOSE_AE  and monitor blood pressure regularly. Continue to monitor blood pressure at regular intervals in patients with Avastin-induced or -exacerbated  hypertension≠B-NonOSE_AE  after discontinuing Avastin. Withhold Avastin in patients with severe  hypertension≠B-NonOSE_AE  that is not controlled with medical management; resume once controlled with medical management. Discontinue in patients who develop  hypertensive≠B-NonOSE_AE   crisis≠I-NonOSE_AE  or  hypertensive≠B-NonOSE_AE   encephalopathy≠I-NonOSE_AE .

    5.7  Posterior≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   Reversible≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   Encephalopathy≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   Syndrome≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  PRES≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE )

   PRES≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was reported in < 0.5% of patients across clinical studies. The onset of symptoms occurred from 16 hours to 1 year after the first dose.  PRES≠B-NonOSE_AE  is a  neurological≠B-NonOSE_AE   disorder≠I-NonOSE_AE  which can present with  headache≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  seizure≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  lethargy≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  confusion≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  blindness≠B-NonOSE_AE  and other  visual≠B-NonOSE_AE  and neurologic  disturbances≠I-NonOSE_AE . Mild to severe  hypertension≠B-NonOSE_AE  may be present. Magnetic resonance imaging is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of  PRES≠B-NonOSE_AE .

 Discontinue Avastin in patients who develop  PRES≠B-NonOSE_AE . Symptoms usually resolve or improve within days after discontinuing Avastin, although some patients have experienced ongoing  neurologic≠B-NonOSE_AE   sequelae≠I-NonOSE_AE . The safety of reinitiating Avastin in patients who developed  PRES≠B-NonOSE_AE  is not known.

    5.8  Renal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   Injury≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and Proteinuria

  The incidence and severity of  proteinuria≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  is higher in patients receiving Avastin as compared to patients receiving chemotherapy. Grade 3 (defined as  urine≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   dipstick≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   4≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  +≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   or≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   >≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   3≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  .≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  5≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   grams≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   protein≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   per≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   2≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  4≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   hours≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ) to Grade 4 (defined as  nephrotic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   syndrome≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ) ranged from 0.7% to 7% in clinical studies. The overall incidence of  proteinuria≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (all grades) was only adequately assessed in Study BO17705, in which the incidence was 20%. Median onset of  proteinuria≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was 5.6 months (15 days to 37 months) after initiating Avastin. Median time to resolution was 6.1 months (95% CI: 2.8, 11.3).  Proteinuria≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  did not resolve in 40% of patients after median follow-up of 11.2 months and required discontinuation of Avastin in 30% of the patients who developed  proteinuria≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .

 In an exploratory, pooled analysis of patients from seven randomized clinical studies, 5% of patients receiving Avastin with chemotherapy experienced Grades 2-4 (defined as  urine≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   dipstick≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   2≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  +≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   or≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   greater≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   or≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   >≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   1≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   gram≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   protein≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   per≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   2≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  4≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   hours≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  or  nephrotic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   syndrome≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE )  proteinuria≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . Grades 2-4  proteinuria≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  resolved in 74% of patients. Avastin was reinitiated in 42% of patients. Of the 113 patients who reinitiated Avastin, 48% experienced a second episode of Grade 2-4  proteinuria≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .

  Nephrotic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   syndrome≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred in < 1% of patients receiving Avastin across clinical studies, in some instances with  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE  outcome. In a published case series, kidney biopsy of 6 patients with  proteinuria≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  showed findings consistent with  thrombotic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   microangiopathy≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . Results of a retrospective analysis of 5805 patients who received Avastin with chemotherapy and 3713 patients who received chemotherapy alone, showed higher rates of  elevated≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   serum≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   creatinine≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   levels≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (between 1.5 to 1.9 times baseline levels) in patients who received Avastin. Serum creatinine levels did not return to baseline in approximately one-third of patients who received Avastin.

 Monitor  proteinuria≠B-NonOSE_AE  by dipstick urine analysis for the development or worsening of  proteinuria≠B-NonOSE_AE  with serial urinalyses during Avastin therapy. Patients with a 2+ or greater urine dipstick reading should undergo further assessment with a 24-hour urine collection. Withhold for  proteinuria≠B-NonOSE_AE  greater than or equal to 2 grams per 24 hours and resume when less than 2 grams per 24 hours. Discontinue in patients who develop  nephrotic≠B-NonOSE_AE   syndrome≠I-NonOSE_AE .

 Data from a postmarketing safety study showed poor correlation between UPCR (Urine Protein/Creatinine Ratio) and 24-hour urine protein [Pearson Correlation 0.39 (95% CI: 0.17, 0.57)] .  

    5.9 Infusion Reactions

   Infusion≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  reported across clinical studies and post-marketing experience include  hypertension≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  hypertensive≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   crises≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  associated with  neurologic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   signs≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   and≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   symptoms≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  wheezing≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  oxygen≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   desaturation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , Grade 3  hypersensitivity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  chest≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  headaches≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  rigors≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  diaphoresis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . In clinical studies,  infusion≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  with the first dose occurred in < 3% of patients and severe reactions occurred in 0.2% of patients.

 Decrease the rate of infusion for mild, clinically insignificant  infusion≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE . Interrupt the infusion in patients with clinically significant  infusion≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE  and consider resuming at a slower rate following resolution. Discontinue in patients who develop a severe  infusion≠B-NonOSE_AE   reaction≠I-NonOSE_AE  and administer appropriate medical therapy (e.g., epinephrine, corticosteroids, intravenous antihistamines, bronchodilators and/or oxygen).

    5.10  Embryo≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  Fetal≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   Toxicity≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE 

  Avastin may cause  fetal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   harm≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies.  Congenital≠B-NonOSE_AE   malformations≠I-NonOSE_AE  were observed with the administration of bevacizumab to  pregnant≠B-NonOSE_AE  rabbits during organogenesis every 3 days at a dose as low as a clinical dose of 10 mg/kg. Furthermore, animal models link angiogenesis and VEGF and VEGFR 2 to critical aspects of female reproduction, embryo-fetal development, and postnatal development. Advise  pregnant≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  women of the potential  risk≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   to≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   a≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   fetus≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with and for 6 months after the last dose of Avastin [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1  ,  8.3)  ,  Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)  ].  

    5.11 Ovarian Failure

  The incidence of  ovarian≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   failure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  was 34% vs. 2% in  premenopausal≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  women receiving Avastin with chemotherapy as compared to those receiving chemotherapy alone for adjuvant treatment of a solid  tumor≠B-Not_AE_Candidate . After discontinuing Avastin, recovery of ovarian function at all time points during the post-treatment period was demonstrated in 22% of women receiving Avastin. Recovery of ovarian function is defined as resumption of menses, a  positive≠B-NonOSE_AE   serum≠I-NonOSE_AE   beta≠I-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  HCG≠I-NonOSE_AE   pregnancy≠I-NonOSE_AE   test≠I-NonOSE_AE , or a FSH level < 30 mIU/mL during the post-treatment period. Long-term effects of Avastin on fertility are unknown. Inform females of reproductive potential of the risk of  ovarian≠B-NonOSE_AE   failure≠I-NonOSE_AE  prior to initiating Avastin [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ,  Use in Specific Populations (8.3)  ].  

    5.12 Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)

   Avastin is not indicated for use with anthracycline-based chemotherapy. The incidence of Grade >= 3  left≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   ventricular≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   dysfunction≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  was 1% in patients receiving Avastin compared to 0.6% of patients receiving chemotherapy alone. Among patients who received prior anthracycline treatment, the rate of  CHF≠B-NonOSE_AE  was 4% for patients receiving Avastin with chemotherapy as compared to 0.6% for patients receiving chemotherapy alone.  

  In previously untreated patients with a  hematological≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   malignancy≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , the incidence of  CHF≠B-NonOSE_AE  and  decline≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   left≠I-NonOSE_AE   ventricular≠I-NonOSE_AE   ejection≠I-NonOSE_AE   fraction≠I-NonOSE_AE   (≠I-NonOSE_AE  LVEF≠I-NonOSE_AE ) were increased in patients receiving Avastin with anthracycline-based chemotherapy compared to patients receiving placebo with the same chemotherapy regimen. The proportion of patients with a  decline≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   LVEF≠I-NonOSE_AE  from baseline of >= 20% or a decline from baseline of 10% to < 50%, was 10% in patients receiving Avastin with chemotherapy compared to 5% in patients receiving chemotherapy alone. Time to onset of  left≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  ventricular≠I-NonOSE_AE   dysfunction≠I-NonOSE_AE  or  CHF≠B-NonOSE_AE  was 1 to 6 months after the first dose in at least 85% of the patients and was resolved in 62% of the patients who developed  CHF≠B-NonOSE_AE  in the Avastin arm compared to 82% in the placebo arm. Discontinue Avastin in patients who develop  CHF≠B-NonOSE_AE .
