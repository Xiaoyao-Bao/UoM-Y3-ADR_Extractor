    ADVERSE REACTIONS  

  TOBI was generally well tolerated during two clinical studies in 258  cystic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   fibrosis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  patients ranging in age from 6 to 48 years. Patients received TOBI in alternating periods of 28 days on and 28 days off drug in addition to their standard  cystic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   fibrosis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  therapy for a total of 24 weeks.

  Voice≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   alteration≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  tinnitus≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  were the only adverse experiences reported by significantly more TOBI-treated patients. Thirty-three patients (13%) treated with TOBI complained of  voice≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   alteration≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  compared to 17 (7%) placebo patients.  Voice≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   alteration≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  was more common in the on-drug periods.

 Eight patients from the TOBI group (3%) reported  tinnitus≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  compared to no placebo patients. All episodes were transient, resolved without discontinuation of the TOBI treatment regimen, and were not associated with  loss≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   hearing≠I-NonOSE_AE  in audiograms.  Tinnitus≠B-NonOSE_AE  is one of the sentinel symptoms of  cochlear≠B-NonOSE_AE   toxicity≠I-NonOSE_AE , and patients with this symptom should be carefully monitored for high frequency  hearing≠B-NonOSE_AE   loss≠I-NonOSE_AE . The numbers of patients reporting  vestibular≠B-NonOSE_AE   adverse≠I-NonOSE_AE   experiences≠I-NonOSE_AE  such as  dizziness≠B-NonOSE_AE  were similar in the TOBI and placebo groups.

 Nine (3%) patients in the TOBI group and nine (3%) patients in the placebo group had  increases≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   serum≠I-NonOSE_AE   creatinine≠I-NonOSE_AE  of at least 50% over baseline. In all nine patients in the TOBI group,  creatinine≠B-NonOSE_AE   decreased≠I-NonOSE_AE  at the next visit.

 Table 1 lists the percent of patients with treatment-emergent adverse experiences (spontaneously reported and solicited) that occurred in >5% of TOBI patients during the two Phase III studies.

   Adverse drug reactions derived from spontaneous reports  

 The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of TOBI. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
