  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 The information below is derived from an integrated clinical study database for LATUDA consisting of 3799 patients exposed to one or more doses of LATUDA for the treatment of  schizophrenia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and  bipolar≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depression≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  in placebo-controlled studies. This experience corresponds with a total experience of 1250.9 patient-years. A total of 1106 LATUDA-treated patients had at least 24 weeks and 371 LATUDA-treated patients had at least 52 weeks of exposure.



 Adverse events during exposure to study treatment were obtained by general inquiry and voluntarily reported adverse experiences, as well as results from physical examinations, vital signs, ECGs, weights and laboratory investigations. Adverse experiences were recorded by clinical investigators using their own terminology. In order to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events, events were grouped in standardized categories using MedDRA terminology.



     Schizophrenia  



 The following findings are based on the short-term, placebo-controlled premarketing studies for  schizophrenia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  in which LATUDA was administered at daily doses ranging from 20 to 160 mg (n=1508).



     Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions:  The most common adverse reactions (incidence >= 5% and at least twice the rate of placebo) in patients treated with LATUDA were  somnolence≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  akathisia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  extrapyramidal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   symptoms≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  nausea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .



     Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment:  A total of 9.5% (143/1508) LATUDA-treated patients and 9.3% (66/708) of placebo-treated patients discontinued due to adverse reactions. There were no adverse reactions associated with discontinuation in subjects treated with LATUDA that were at least 2% and at least twice the placebo rate.



     Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 2% or More in LATUDA-Treated Patients:  Adverse reactions associated with the use of LATUDA (incidence of 2% or greater, rounded to the nearest percent and LATUDA incidence greater than placebo) that occurred during acute therapy (up to 6 weeks in patients with schizophrenia) are shown in  Table 15  .

                  Dose-Related Adverse Reactions in the Schizophrenia Studies  
 

  Akathisia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  extrapyramidal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   symptoms≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  were dose-related. The frequency of  akathisia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  increased with dose up to 120 mg/day (5.6% for LATUDA 20 mg, 10.7% for LATUDA 40 mg, 12.3% for LATUDA 80 mg, and 22.0% for LATUDA 120 mg).  Akathisia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was reported by 7.4% (9/121) of patients receiving 160 mg/day.  Akathisia≠B-NonOSE_AE  occurred in 3.0% of subjects receiving placebo. The frequency of  extrapyramidal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   symptoms≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  increased with dose up to 120 mg/day (5.6% for LATUDA 20 mg, 11.5% for LATUDA 40 mg, 11.9% for LATUDA 80 mg, and 22.0% for LATUDA 120 mg).



     Bipolar Depression (Monotherapy)  



 The following findings are based on the short-term, placebo-controlled premarketing study for  bipolar≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depression≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  in which LATUDA was administered at daily doses ranging from 20 to 120 mg (n=331).



     Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions:  The most common adverse reactions (incidence >= 5%, in either dose group, and at least twice the rate of placebo) in patients treated with LATUDA were  akathisia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  extrapyramidal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   symptoms≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  somnolence≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  nausea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  vomiting≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  diarrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  anxiety≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .



     Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment:  A total of 6.0% (20/331) LATUDA-treated patients and 5.4% (9/168) of placebo-treated patients discontinued due to adverse reactions. There were no adverse reactions associated with discontinuation in subjects treated with LATUDA that were at least 2% and at least twice the placebo rate.



     Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 2% or More in LATUDA-Treated Patients:  Adverse reactions associated with the use of LATUDA (incidence of 2% or greater, rounded to the nearest percent and LATUDA incidence greater than placebo) that occurred during acute therapy (up to 6 weeks in patients with  bipolar≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depression≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ) are shown in  Table 16  .

                 Dose-Related Adverse Reactions in the Monotherapy Study:  
 

 In the short-term, placebo-controlled study (involving lower and higher LATUDA dose ranges) [see Clinical Studies (  14.2  )] the adverse reactions that occurred with a greater than 5% incidence in the patients treated with LATUDA in any dose group and greater than placebo in both groups were  nausea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (10.4%, 17.4%),  somnolence≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (7.3%, 13.8%),  akathisia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (7.9%, 10.8%), and  extrapyramidal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   symptoms≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (4.9%, 9.0%) for LATUDA 20 to 60 mg/day and LATUDA 80 to 120 mg/day, respectively.



     Bipolar Depression  



     Adjunctive Therapy with Lithium or Valproate  



 The following findings are based on two short-term, placebo-controlled premarketing studies for  bipolar≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depression≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  in which LATUDA was administered at daily doses ranging from 20 to 120 mg as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate (n=360).



     Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions:  The most common adverse reactions (incidence >= 5% and at least twice the rate of placebo) in subjects treated with LATUDA were  akathisia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  somnolence≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .



     Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment:  A total of 5.8% (21/360) LATUDA-treated patients and 4.8% (16/334) of placebo-treated patients discontinued due to adverse reactions. There were no adverse reactions associated with discontinuation in subjects treated with LATUDA that were at least 2% and at least twice the placebo rate.



     Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 2% or More in LATUDA-Treated Patients:  Adverse reactions associated with the use of LATUDA (incidence of 2% or greater, rounded to the nearest percent and LATUDA incidence greater than placebo) that occurred during acute therapy (up to 6 weeks in patients with  bipolar≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depression≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ) are shown in  Table 17  .

The percentage of patients who shifted from normal to abnormal was greater in LATUDA-treated patients versus placebo for the BAS (LATUDA, 8.4%; placebo, 5.6%), the SAS (LATUDA, 3.7%; placebo, 1.9%) and the AIMS (LATUDA, 3.4%; placebo, 1.2%).



   Adjunctive Therapy with Lithium or Valproate  



 The mean change from baseline for LATUDA-treated patients for the SAS, BAS and AIMS was comparable to placebo-treated patients. The percentage of patients who shifted from normal to abnormal was greater in LATUDA-treated patients versus placebo for the BAS (LATUDA, 8.7%; placebo, 2.1%), the SAS (LATUDA, 2.8%; placebo, 2.1%) and the AIMS (LATUDA, 2.8%; placebo, 0.6%).



     Dystonia  



     Class Effect:  Symptoms of  dystonia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , prolonged  abnormal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   contractions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   muscle≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   groups≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment.  Dystonic≠B-NonOSE_AE   symptoms≠I-NonOSE_AE  include:  spasm≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   the≠I-NonOSE_AE   neck≠I-NonOSE_AE   muscles≠I-NonOSE_AE , sometimes progressing to  tightness≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   the≠I-NonOSE_AE   throat≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  swallowing≠B-NonOSE_AE   difficulty≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  difficulty≠B-NonOSE_AE   breathing≠I-NonOSE_AE , and/or  protrusion≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE  the  tongue≠I-NonOSE_AE . While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first-generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of  acute≠B-NonOSE_AE   dystonia≠I-NonOSE_AE  is observed in males and younger age groups.



     Schizophrenia  



 In the short-term, placebo-controlled  schizophrenia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  clinical studies,  dystonia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred in 4.2% of LATUDA-treated subjects (0.0% LATUDA 20 mg, 3.5% LATUDA 40 mg, 4.5% LATUDA 80 mg, 6.5% LATUDA 120 mg and 2.5% LATUDA 160 mg) compared to 0.8% of subjects receiving placebo. Seven subjects (0.5%, 7/1508) discontinued clinical trials due to dystonic events - four were receiving LATUDA 80 mg/day and three were receiving LATUDA 120 mg/day.



     Bipolar Depression  



     Monotherapy  



 In the short-term, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy  bipolar≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depression≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  study,  dystonia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred in 0.9% of LATUDA-treated subjects (0.0% and 1.8% for LATUDA 20 to 60 mg/day and LATUDA 80 to 120 mg/day, respectively) compared to 0.0% of subjects receiving placebo. No subject discontinued the clinical study due to  dystonic≠B-NonOSE_AE   events≠I-NonOSE_AE .



     Adjunctive Therapy with Lithium or Valproate  



 In the short-term, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled adjunctive therapy  bipolar≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depression≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  studies,  dystonia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred in 1.1% of LATUDA-treated subjects (20 to 120 mg) compared to 0.6% of subjects receiving placebo. No subject discontinued the clinical study due to  dystonic≠B-NonOSE_AE   events≠I-NonOSE_AE .



     Other Adverse Reactions Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of LATUDA  



 Following is a list of adverse reactions reported by patients treated with LATUDA at multiple doses of >= 20 mg once daily within the premarketing database of 2905 patients with  schizophrenia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate . The reactions listed are those that could be of clinical importance, as well as reactions that are plausibly drug-related on pharmacologic or other grounds. Reactions listed in  Table 15  or those that appear elsewhere in the LATUDA label are not included. Although the reactions reported occurred during treatment with LATUDA, they were not necessarily caused by it.



 Reactions are further categorized by organ class and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: those occurring in at least 1/100 patients (frequent) (only those not already listed in the tabulated results from placebo-controlled studies appear in this listing); those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients (infrequent); and those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients (rare).

A  creatinine≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  shift from normal to  high≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred in 3.0% (43/1453) of LATUDA-treated patients and 1.6% (11/681) on placebo. The threshold for  high≠B-NonOSE_AE   creatinine≠I-NonOSE_AE  value varied from > 0.79 to > 1.3 mg/dL based on the centralized laboratory definition for each study (  Table 21  ).
