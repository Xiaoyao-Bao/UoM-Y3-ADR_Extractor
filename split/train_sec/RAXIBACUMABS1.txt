  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of raxibacumab has been studied only in healthy volunteers. It has not been studied in patients with inhalational anthrax.



 The safety of raxibacumab has been evaluated in 326 healthy subjects treated with a dose of 40 mg/kg in 3 clinical trials: a drug interaction trial with ciprofloxacin (Study 1), a repeat-dose trial of 20 subjects with the second raxibacumab dose administered >=4 months after the first dose (Study 2), and a placebo-controlled trial evaluating single doses with a subset of subjects receiving 2 raxibacumab doses 14 days apart (Study 3). Raxibacumab was administered to 86 healthy subjects in Study 1. In Study 3, 240 healthy subjects received raxibacumab (217 received 1 dose and 23 received 2 doses) and 80 subjects received placebo.



 The overall safety of raxibacumab was evaluated as an integrated summary of these 3 clinical trials. Of 326 raxibacumab subjects, 283 received single doses, 23 received 2 doses 14 days apart, and 20 received 2 doses more than 4 months apart. The subjects were 18 to 88 years of age, 53% female, 74% white, 17% black/African American, 6% Asian, and 15% Hispanic.



   Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation of Raxibacumab Infusion  



 Four subjects (1.2%) had their infusion of raxibacumab discontinued for adverse reactions: 2 subjects (neither of whom received diphenhydramine premedication) due to  urticaria≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (mild), and 1 subject each discontinued for  clonus≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (mild) and  dyspnea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (moderate).



   Most Frequently Reported Adverse Reactions  



 The most frequently reported adverse reactions were  rash≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  pain≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   extremity≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  pruritus≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  somnolence≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .

              Rashes  
 

 For all subjects exposed to raxibacumab in clinical trials, the rate of  rash≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was 2.8% (9/326) compared with 1.3% (1/80) of placebo subjects. Mild to moderate  infusion≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  related≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   rashes≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  were reported in 22.2% (6/27) of subjects who did not receive diphenhydramine premedication compared to 3.3% (2/61) of subjects who were premedicated with diphenhydramine in the ciprofloxacin/raxibacumab combination trial (Study 1). In the placebo-controlled raxibacumab study where all subjects received diphenhydramine (Study 3), the rate of  rash≠B-NonOSE_AE  was 2.5% in both placebo- and raxibacumab-treated subjects.



   Less Common Adverse Reactions  



 Clinically significant adverse reactions that were reported in <1.5% of subjects exposed to raxibacumab and at rates higher than in placebo subjects are listed below:

      Immunogenicity  
 

 The development of  anti≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  raxibacumab≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   antibodies≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  was evaluated in all subjects receiving single and double doses of raxibacumab in Studies 1, 2, and 3.  Immunogenic≠B-NonOSE_AE   responses≠I-NonOSE_AE   against≠I-NonOSE_AE   raxibacumab≠I-NonOSE_AE   were≠I-NonOSE_AE   not≠I-NonOSE_AE   detected≠I-NonOSE_AE  in any raxibacumab-treated human subjects following single or repeat doses of raxibacumab.



 The incidence of  antibody≠B-NonOSE_AE   formation≠I-NonOSE_AE  is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the immunogenicity assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of any  antibody≠B-NonOSE_AE   positivity≠I-NonOSE_AE  in an assay is highly dependent on several factors, including assay sensitivity and specificity, assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of  antibodies≠B-NonOSE_AE   to≠I-NonOSE_AE   raxibacumab≠I-NonOSE_AE  with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.
