   5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

   EXCERPT:    *  Diarrhea: Patients may experience severe diarrhea. If severe diarrhea occurs,suspend dosing and rehydrate the patient. (  5.2  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Risk of Serious Dehydration in Pediatric Patients

  LINZESS is contraindicated in patients less than 6 years of age. The safety and effectiveness of LINZESS in patients less than 18 years of age have not been established. In neonatal mice (human age equivalent of approximately 0 to 28 days), linaclotide  increased≠B-NonOSE_AE   fluid≠I-NonOSE_AE   secretion≠I-NonOSE_AE  as a consequence of GC-C agonism resulting in  mortality≠B-NonOSE_AE  within the first 24 hours due to  dehydration≠B-NonOSE_AE . Due to increased intestinal expression of GC-C, patients less than 6 years of age may be more likely than patients 6 years of age and older to develop severe  diarrhea≠B-NonOSE_AE  and its potentially serious consequences.

 Avoid use of LINZESS in pediatric patients 6 years to less than 18 years of age. Although there were no  deaths≠B-NonOSE_AE  in older juvenile mice, given the  deaths≠B-NonOSE_AE  in young juvenile mice and the lack of clinical safety and efficacy data in pediatric patients, avoid the use of LINZESS in pediatric patients 6 years to less than 18 years of age [see Contraindications (  4  ), Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  ), Use in Specific Populations (  8.4  )]  .

    5.2 Diarrhea

      Diarrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was the most common adverse reaction of LINZESS-treated patients in the pooled IBS-C and CIC double-blind placebo-controlled trials. The incidence of  diarrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was similar between the  IBS≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  C≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and  CIC≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  populations. Severe  diarrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was reported in 2% of 145 mcg and 290 mcg LINZESS-treated patients, and in <1% of 72 mcg LINZESS-treated CIC patients [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  .

    In post-marketing experience, severe  diarrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  associated with  dizziness≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  syncope≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  hypotension≠B-NonOSE_AE  and  electrolyte≠B-NonOSE_AE   abnormalities≠I-NonOSE_AE  ( hypokalemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  and  hyponatremia≠B-NonOSE_AE ) requiring hospitalization or intravenous fluid administration have been reported in patients treated with LINZESS.

    If severe  diarrhea≠B-NonOSE_AE  occurs, suspend dosing and rehydrate the patient.
