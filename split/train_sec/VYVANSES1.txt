  6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

 The safety data in this section is based on data from the 4-week parallel-group controlled clinical studies of VYVANSE in pediatric and adult patients with  ADHD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   [see  Clinical Studies (14.1)  ]  .

     Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment in ADHD Clinical Trials  

 In the controlled trial in patients ages 6 to 12 years (Study 1), 8% (18/218) of VYVANSE-treated patients discontinued due to adverse reactions compared to 0% (0/72) of placebo-treated patients. The most frequently reported adverse reactions (1% or more and twice rate of placebo) were  ECG≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   voltage≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   criteria≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   for≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   ventricular≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   hypertrophy≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  tic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  vomiting≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  psychomotor≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   hyperactivity≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  insomnia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  decreased≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   appetite≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  rash≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  [2 instances for each adverse reaction, i.e., 2/218 (1%)]. Less frequently reported adverse reactions (less than 1% or less than twice rate of placebo) included  abdominal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   upper≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  dry≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   mouth≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  weight≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   decreased≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  dizziness≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  somnolence≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  logorrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  chest≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  anger≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  hypertension≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .

 In the controlled trial in patients ages 13 to 17 years (Study 4), 3% (7/233) of VYVANSE-treated patients discontinued due to adverse reactions compared to 1% (1/77) of placebo-treated patients. The most frequently reported adverse reactions (1% or more and twice rate of placebo) were  decreased≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   appetite≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (2/233; 1%) and  insomnia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (2/233; 1%). Less frequently reported adverse reactions (less than 1% or less than twice rate of placebo) included  irritability≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  dermatillomania≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  mood≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   swings≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  dyspnea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .

 In the controlled adult trial (Study 7), 6% (21/358) of VYVANSE-treated patients discontinued due to adverse reactions compared to 2% (1/62) of placebo-treated patients. The most frequently reported adverse reactions (1% or more and twice rate of placebo) were  insomnia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (8/358; 2%),  tachycardia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (3/358; 1%),  irritability≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (2/358; 1%),  hypertension≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (4/358; 1%),  headache≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (2/358; 1%),  anxiety≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (2/358; 1%), and  dyspnea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (3/358; 1%).

     Weight Loss and Slowing Growth Rate in Pediatric Patients with ADHD  

 In a controlled trial of VYVANSE in children ages 6 to 12 years (Study 1), mean  weight≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   loss≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  from baseline after 4 weeks of therapy was -0.9, -1.9, and -2.5 pounds, respectively, for patients receiving 30 mg, 50 mg, and 70 mg of VYVANSE, compared to a 1 pound  weight≠B-NonOSE_AE   gain≠I-NonOSE_AE  for patients receiving placebo. Higher doses were associated with greater  weight≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   loss≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  with 4 weeks of treatment. Careful follow-up for weight in children ages 6 to 12 years who received VYVANSE over 12 months suggests that consistently medicated children (i.e. treatment for 7 days per week throughout the year) have a  slowing≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   growth≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   rate≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , measured by body weight as demonstrated by an age- and sex-normalized mean change from baseline in percentile, of -13.4 over 1 year (average percentiles at baseline and 12 months were 60.9 and 47.2, respectively). In a 4-week controlled trial of VYVANSE in adolescents ages 13 to 17 years, mean  weight≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   loss≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  from baseline to endpoint was -2.7, -4.3, and -4.8 lbs., respectively, for patients receiving 30 mg, 50 mg, and 70 mg of VYVANSE, compared to a 2.0 pound  weight≠B-NonOSE_AE   gain≠I-NonOSE_AE  for patients receiving placebo.

 Careful follow-up of weight and height in children ages 7 to 10 years who were randomized to either methylphenidate or non-medication treatment groups over 14 months, as well as in naturalistic subgroups of newly methylphenidate-treated and non-medication treated children over 36 months (to the ages of 10 to 13 years), suggests that consistently medicated children (i.e. treatment for 7 days per week throughout the year) have a temporary  slowing≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   growth≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   rate≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (on average, a total of about  2≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   cm≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   less≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   growth≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   height≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  2≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  .≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  7≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   kg≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   less≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   growth≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   weight≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  over 3 years), without evidence of growth rebound during this period of development. In a controlled trial of amphetamine (d- to l-enantiomer ratio of 3:1) in adolescents, mean  weight≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   change≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  from baseline within the initial 4 weeks of therapy was -1.1 pounds and -2.8 pounds, respectively, for patients receiving 10 mg and 20 mg of amphetamine. Higher doses were associated with greater  weight≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   loss≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  within the initial 4 weeks of treatment  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.5)  ]  .

     Weight Loss in Adults with ADHD  

 In the controlled adult trial (Study 7), mean  weight≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   loss≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  after 4 weeks of therapy was 2.8 pounds, 3.1 pounds, and 4.3 pounds, for patients receiving final doses of 30 mg, 50 mg, and 70 mg of VYVANSE, respectively, compared to a mean  weight≠B-NonOSE_AE   gain≠I-NonOSE_AE  of 0.5 pounds for patients receiving placebo.

 The safety data in this section is based on data from two 12 week parallel group, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled studies in adults with  BED≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   [see  Clinical Studies 14.2  ]  . Patients with cardiovascular risk factors other than  obesity≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and smoking were excluded.

     Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment in BED Clinical Trials  

 In controlled trials of patients ages 18 to 55 years, 5.1% (19/373) of VYVANSE-treated patients discontinued due to adverse reactions compared to 2.4% (9/372) of placebo-treated patients. No single adverse reaction led to discontinuation in 1% or more of VYVANSE-treated patients. Less commonly reported adverse reactions (less than 1% or less than twice rate of placebo) included  increased≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   heart≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   rate≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  headache≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  abdominal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   upper≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  dyspnea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  rash≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  insomnia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  irritability≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  feeling≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   jittery≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  anxiety≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .

 The most common adverse reactions (incidence >=5% and at a rate at least twice placebo) reported in adults were  dry≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   mouth≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  insomnia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  decreased≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   appetite≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  increased≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   heart≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   rate≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  constipation≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  feeling≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   jittery≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  anxiety≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .

 Adverse reactions reported in the pooled controlled trials in adult patients (Study 11 and 12) treated with VYVANSE or placebo are presented in Table 4 below.

           6.2 Postmarketing Experience
   The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of VYVANSE. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These events are as follows:  cardiomyopathy≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  mydriasis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  diplopia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  difficulties≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   with≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   visual≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   accommodation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  blurred≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   vision≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  eosinophilic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   hepatitis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  anaphylactic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reaction≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  hypersensitivity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  dyskinesia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  dysgeusia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  tics≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  bruxism≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  depression≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  dermatillomania≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  alopecia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  aggression≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  Stevens≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  Johnson≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   Syndrome≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  chest≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  angioedema≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  urticaria≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  seizures≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  libido≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   changes≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  frequent≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  or prolonged  erections≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  constipation≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  rhabdomyolysis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .
