    6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

  EXCERPT:   The most frequently occurring adverse reactions (>= 5% and greater than placebo) were nausea, headache, constipation, dizziness, insomnia, hot flush, hyperhidrosis, vomiting, palpitations, heart rate increased, dry mouth, and hypertension (  6.1  ).

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     Patient Exposure  



 Savella was evaluated in three double-blind placebo-controlled trials involving 2209  fibromyalgia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  patients (1557 patients treated with Savella and 652 patients treated with placebo) for a treatment period up to 29 weeks.



 The stated frequencies of adverse reactions represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatment-emergent adverse reaction of the type listed. A reaction was considered treatment emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation.



     Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation  



 In placebo-controlled trials in patients with  fibromyalgia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , 23% of patients treated with Savella



 100 mg/day, 26% of patients treated with Savella 200 mg/day discontinued prematurely due to adverse reactions, compared to 12% of patients treated with placebo. The adverse reactions that led to  withdrawal≠B-NonOSE_AE  in >= 1% of patients in the Savella treatment group and with an incidence rate greater than that in the placebo treatment group were  nausea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (milnacipran 6%, placebo 1%),  palpitations≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (milnacipran 3%, placebo 1%),  headache≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (milnacipran 2%, placebo 0%),  constipation≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (milnacipran 1%, placebo 0%),  heart≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   rate≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   increased≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (milnacipran 1%, placebo 0%),  hyperhidrosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (milnacipran 1%, placebo 0%),  vomiting≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (milnacipran 1%, placebo 0%), and  dizziness≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (milnacipran 1% and placebo 0.5%). Discontinuation due to adverse reactions was generally more common among patients treated with Savella 200 mg/day compared to Savella 100 mg/day.



     Most Common Adverse Reactions in Placebo Controlled Trials  



 In the placebo-controlled fibromyalgia patient trials, the most frequently occurring adverse reaction in clinical trials was  nausea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . The most common adverse reactions (incidence >= 5% and twice placebo) in patients treated with Savella were  constipation≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  hot≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   flush≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  hyperhidrosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  vomiting≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  palpitations≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  heart≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   rate≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   increased≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  dry≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   mouth≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  hypertension≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .



     Table 4    lists all adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients treated with Savella at either 100 or 200 mg/day and at an incidence greater than that of placebo.

 In placebo-controlled fibromyalgia clinical trials, patients treated with Savella for up to 3 months experienced a mean  weight≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   loss≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  of approximately 0.8 kg in both the Savella 100 mg/day and the Savella 200 mg/day treatment groups, compared with a mean  weight≠B-NonOSE_AE   loss≠I-NonOSE_AE  of approximately 0.2 kg in placebo-treated patients.

 In the placebo-controlled  fibromyalgia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  studies, the following treatment-emergent adverse reactions related to the genitourinary system were observed in at least 2% of male patients treated with Savella, and occurred at a rate greater than in placebo-treated male patients:  dysuria≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  ejaculation≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   disorder≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  erectile≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   dysfunction≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  ejaculation≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   failure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  libido≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   decreased≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  prostatitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  scrotal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  testicular≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  testicular≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   swelling≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  urinary≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   hesitation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  urinary≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   retention≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  urethral≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  urine≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   flow≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   decreased≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE .



     Other Adverse Reactions Observed During Clinical Trials of Savella in Fibromyalgia  



 Following is a list of frequent (those occurring on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients) treatment-emergent adverse reactions reported from 1824  fibromyalgia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  patients treated with Savella for periods up to 68 weeks. The listing does not include those events already listed in    Table 4    , those events for which a drug cause was remote, those events which were so general as to be uninformative, and those events reported only once which did not have a substantial probability of being acutely life threatening.



 Adverse reactions are categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency. Adverse reactions of major clinical importance are described in the  Warnings and Precautions section (  5  )  .

   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following additional adverse reactions have been identified from spontaneous reports of Savella received worldwide. These adverse reactions have been chosen for inclusion because of a combination of seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to Savella. However, because these adverse reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These events include:
