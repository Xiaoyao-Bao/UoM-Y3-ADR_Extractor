   WARNINGS

  The potential for a  delayed≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   hypersensitivity≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   reaction≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  to fluorouracil exists. Patch testing to prove  hypersensitivity≠B-NonOSE_AE  may be inconclusive.

 Patients should discontinue therapy with Carac if symptoms of  DPD≠B-NonOSE_AE   enzyme≠I-NonOSE_AE   deficiency≠I-NonOSE_AE  develop.

 Rarely, unexpected systemic toxicity (e.g.,  stomatitis≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  diarrhea≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  neutropenia≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  neurotoxicity≠B-NonOSE_AE ) associated with parenteral administration of fluorouracil has been attributed to  deficiency≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   of≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   dihydropyrimidine≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   dehydrogenase≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   "≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  DPD≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  "≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  activity. One case of life-threatening systemic toxicity has been reported with the topical use of 5% fluorouracil in a patient with a complete  absence≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   of≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   DPD≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   enzyme≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   activity≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Symptoms included severe  abdominal≠B-NonOSE_AE   pain≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  bloody≠B-NonOSE_AE   diarrhea≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  vomiting≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  fever≠B-NonOSE_AE , and  chills≠B-NonOSE_AE . Physical examination revealed  stomatitis≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  erythematous≠B-NonOSE_AE   skin≠I-NonOSE_AE   rash≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  neutropenia≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  thrombocytopenia≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  inflammation≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   the≠I-NonOSE_AE   esophagus≠I-NonOSE_AE , stomach, and small bowel. Although this case was observed with 5% fluorouracil cream, it is unknown whether patients with profound  DPD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   enzyme≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   deficiency≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  would develop  systemic≠B-NonOSE_AE   toxicity≠I-NonOSE_AE  with lower concentrations of topically applied fluorouracil.

 Applications to  mucous≠B-NonOSE_AE   membranes≠I-NonOSE_AE  should be avoided due to the possibility of local  inflammation≠I-NonOSE_AE  and ulceration.
