    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *    Dyspnea was reported more frequently with BRILINTA than with control agents in clinical trials. Dyspnea resulting from BRILINTA is self-limiting.  (5.3)   
 *    Severe Hepatic Impairment: Likely increase in exposure to ticagrelor.  (5.5)   
    
 

    5.1 General Risk of Bleeding  



   Drugs that inhibit platelet function including BRILINTA increase the risk of  bleeding≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  [see   Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ].  



  If possible, manage  bleeding≠B-NonOSE_AE  without discontinuing BRILINTA. Stopping BRILINTA increases the risk of subsequent  cardiovascular≠B-NonOSE_AE   events≠I-NonOSE_AE  [ see        Warnings and Precautions (5.4)        and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ].  



    5.2 Concomitant Aspirin Maintenance Dose



  In PLATO the use of BRILINTA with maintenance doses of aspirin above 100 mg decreased the effectiveness of BRILINTA. Therefore, after the initial loading dose of aspirin, use BRILINTA with a maintenance dose of aspirin of 75-100 mg [ see     Dosage and Administration (2.1)     and     Clinical Studies (14.1)    ] .  



     5.3 Dyspnea  



   In clinical trials, about 14% of patients treated with BRILINTA developed  dyspnea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .  Dyspnea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was usually mild to moderate in intensity and often resolved during continued treatment, but led to study drug discontinuation in 0.9% of BRILINTA and 0.1% of clopidogrel patients in PLATO and 4.3% of BRILINTA 60 mg and 0.7% on aspirin alone patients in PEGASUS.  



  In a substudy of PLATO, 199 subjects underwent pulmonary function testing irrespective of whether they reported  dyspnea≠B-NonOSE_AE . There was no indication of an  adverse≠B-NonOSE_AE   effect≠I-NonOSE_AE   on≠I-NonOSE_AE   pulmonary≠I-NonOSE_AE  function assessed after one month or after at least 6 months of chronic treatment.  



  If a patient develops new, prolonged, or worsened  dyspnea≠B-NonOSE_AE  that is determined to be related to BRILINTA, no specific treatment is required; continue BRILINTA without interruption if possible. In the case of intolerable  dyspnea≠B-NonOSE_AE  requiring discontinuation of BRILINTA, consider prescribing another antiplatelet agent.  



     5.4 Discontinuation of BRILINTA  



   Discontinuation of BRILINTA will increase the risk of  myocardial≠B-NonOSE_AE   infarction≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  stroke≠B-NonOSE_AE , and  death≠B-NonOSE_AE . If BRILINTA must be temporarily discontinued (e.g., to treat  bleeding≠B-NonOSE_AE  or for significant surgery), restart it as soon as possible. When possible, interrupt therapy with BRILINTA for five days prior to surgery that has a major risk of  bleeding≠B-NonOSE_AE . Resume BRILINTA as soon as hemostasis is achieved.  



     5.5 Severe Hepatic Impairment  



   Avoid use of BRILINTA in patients with severe  hepatic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   impairment≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Severe  hepatic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   impairment≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  is likely to increase serum concentration of ticagrelor. There are no studies of BRILINTA patients with severe  hepatic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   impairment≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  [see   Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)    ].
