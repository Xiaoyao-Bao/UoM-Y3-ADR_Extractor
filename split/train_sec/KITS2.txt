    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



  EXCERPT:    Hypersensitivity: Ask patients about prior reactions to drugs, especially dextran or modified forms of dextran.  Observe for hypersensitivity signs and symptoms following Lymphoseek injection.  Have resuscitation equipment and trained personnel immediately available. (  5.1  )  



 



   5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions



   Lymphoseek may pose a risk of  hypersensitivity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   due≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   to≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   its≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   chemical≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   similarity≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  to dextran [see  Description (11)  ]  .  Serious  hypersensitivity≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE  have been associated with dextran and modified forms of dextran (such as iron dextran drugs).  



 Before administering Lymphoseek, ask patients about prior  hypersensitivity≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE  to drugs, especially to dextran and modified forms of dextran.  Have resuscitation equipment and trained personnel immediately available at the time of Lymphoseek administration.



    5.2 Radiation Risks



   Any radiation-emitting product may increase the  risk≠B-NonOSE_AE   for≠I-NonOSE_AE   cancer≠I-NonOSE_AE , especially in pediatric patients.  Adhere to the dose recommendations and ensure safe handling to minimize the risk for excessive  radiation≠B-NonOSE_AE   exposure≠I-NonOSE_AE  to either patients or health care workers.
