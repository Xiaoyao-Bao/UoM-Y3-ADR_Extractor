   5.1 Existing Pregnancy



   ella  is not indicated for termination of an existing  pregnancy≠B-Not_AE_Candidate .  Pregnancy≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  should be excluded before prescribing ella.  If  pregnancy≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  cannot be excluded on the basis of history and/or physical examination,  pregnancy≠B-NonOSE_AE   testing≠I-NonOSE_AE  should be performed. A follow-up physical or pelvic examination is recommended if there is any doubt concerning the general health or  pregnancy≠B-NonOSE_AE  status of any woman after taking ella  .



    5.2 Ectopic Pregnancy



  A history of  ectopic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   pregnancy≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  is not a contraindication to use of this emergency contraceptive method.  Healthcare providers, however, should consider the possibility of  ectopic≠B-NonOSE_AE   pregnancy≠I-NonOSE_AE  in women who become  pregnant≠B-NonOSE_AE  or complain of  lower≠B-NonOSE_AE   abdominal≠I-NonOSE_AE   pain≠I-NonOSE_AE  after taking ella  .  A follow-up physical or pelvic examination is recommended if there is any doubt concerning the general health or  pregnancy≠B-NonOSE_AE  status of any woman after taking ella  .



    5.3 Repeated Use



   ella  is for occasional use as an  emergency≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   contraceptive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . It should not replace a regular method of contraception. Repeated use of ella  within the same menstrual cycle is not recommended, as safety and efficacy of repeat use within the same cycle has not been evaluated.



    5.4 CYP3A4 Inducers



  A CYP3A4 inducer, rifampin, decreases the plasma concentration of ella significantly. Ella  should not be administered with CYP3A4 inducers [see Drug interactions (  7.1  ) and Pharmacokinetics (  12.3  )]  .



    5.5 Fertility Following Use



  A rapid return of fertility is likely following treatment with ella  for emergency contraception; therefore, routine contraception should be continued or initiated as soon as possible following use of ella  to ensure ongoing prevention of  pregnancy≠B-NonOSE_AE . While there are no data about use of ella  with regular hormonal contraceptives, due to its high affinity binding to the progesterone receptor, use of ella  may reduce the contraceptive action of regular hormonal contraceptive methods. Therefore, after use of ella  , a reliable barrier method of contraception should be used with subsequent acts of intercourse that occur in that same menstrual cycle.



    5.6 Effect on Menstrual Cycle



  After ella  intake,  menses≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  sometimes  occur≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  earlier or  later≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  than expected by a few days. In clinical trials, cycle length was increased by a mean of 2.5 days but returned to normal in the subsequent cycle. Seven percent of subjects reported  menses≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurring more than 7 days  earlier≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  than expected, and 19% reported a delay of more than 7 days. If there is a  delay≠B-NonOSE_AE  in the onset of expected  menses≠I-NonOSE_AE  beyond 1 week, rule out  pregnancy≠B-Not_AE_Candidate .



 Nine percent of women studied reported  intermenstrual≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   bleeding≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  after use of ella.  



    5.7 Sexually Transmitted Infections/HIV



   ella  does not protect against  HIV≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   infection≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   (≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  AIDS≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ) or other  sexually≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   transmitted≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   infections≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   (≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  STIs≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ).
