  6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



 Safety data for OPSUMIT were obtained primarily from one placebo-controlled clinical study in 742 patients with  PAH≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  (SERAPHIN study)  [see  Clinical Studies (14)  ]  . The exposure to OPSUMIT in this trial was up to 3.6 years with a median exposure of about 2 years (N=542 for 1 year; N=429 for 2 years; and N=98 for more than 3 years). The overall incidence of treatment discontinuations because of adverse events was similar across OPSUMIT 10 mg and placebo treatment groups (approximately 11%).



 Table 2 presents adverse reactions more frequent on OPSUMIT than on placebo by >=3%.

           6.2 Postmarketing Experience
   The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of OPSUMIT. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
