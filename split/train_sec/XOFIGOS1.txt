  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 In the randomized clinical trial in patients with  metastatic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   castration≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  resistant≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   prostate≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  with  bone≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   metastases≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , 600 patients received intravenous injections of 50 kBq/kg (1.35 microcurie/kg) of Xofigo and best standard of care and 301 patients received placebo and best standard of care once every 4 weeks for up to 6 injections. Prior to randomization, 58% and 57% of patients had received docetaxel in the Xofigo and placebo arms, respectively. The median duration of treatment was 20 weeks (6 cycles) for Xofigo and 18 weeks (5 cycles) for placebo.



 The most common adverse reactions (>= 10%) in patients receiving Xofigo were  nausea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  diarrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  vomiting≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  peripheral≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   edema≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (Table 3). Grade 3 and 4 adverse events were reported among 57% of Xofigo-treated patients and 63% of placebo-treated patients. The most common  hematologic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   laboratory≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   abnormalities≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  in Xofigo-treated patients (>= 10%) were  anemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  lymphocytopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  leukopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  thrombocytopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  neutropenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (Table 4).



 Treatment discontinuations due to adverse events occurred in 17% of patients who received Xofigo and 21% of patients who received placebo. The most common  hematologic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   laboratory≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   abnormalities≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  leading to discontinuation for Xofigo were  anemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (2%) and  thrombocytopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (2%).



 Table 3 shows adverse reactions occurring in >= 2% of patients and for which the incidence for Xofigo exceeds the incidence for placebo.

  Laboratory values were obtained at baseline and prior to each 4-week cycle.    
           As an adverse reaction, grade 3-4  thrombocytopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was reported in 6% of patients on Xofigo and in 2% of patients on placebo. Among patients who received Xofigo, the  laboratory≠B-NonOSE_AE   abnormality≠I-NonOSE_AE  grade 3-4  thrombocytopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred in 1% of docetaxel naive patients and in 4% of patients who had received prior docetaxel. Grade 3-4  neutropenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred in 1% of docetaxel naive patients and in 3% of patients who have received prior docetaxel.
 

   Fluid Status

   Dehydration≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred in 3% of patients on Xofigo and 1% of patients on placebo. Xofigo increases adverse reactions such as  diarrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  nausea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  vomiting≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  which may result in  dehydration≠B-NonOSE_AE . Monitor patients' oral intake and fluid status carefully and promptly treat patients who display signs or symptoms of  dehydration≠B-NonOSE_AE  or  hypovolemia≠B-NonOSE_AE .



    Injection≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   Site≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   Reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE 

   Erythema≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , pain, and edema  at≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   the≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   injection≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   site≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  were reported in 1% of patients on Xofigo.



   Secondary Malignant Neoplasms

  Xofigo contributes to a patient's overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure. Long-term cumulative radiation exposure may be associated with an  increased≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   risk≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   cancer≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  hereditary≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   defects≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . Due to its mechanism of action and  neoplastic≠B-NonOSE_AE   changes≠I-NonOSE_AE , including  osteosarcomas≠B-NonOSE_AE , in rats following administration of radium-223 dichloride, Xofigo may increase the risk of  osteosarcoma≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  or other  secondary≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   malignant≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   neoplasms≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   [see Nonclinical Toxicology (  13.1  )]  . However, the overall incidence of new  malignancies≠B-NonOSE_AE  in the randomized trial was lower on the Xofigo arm compared to placebo (<1% vs. 2%; respectively), but the expected latency period for the development of  secondary≠B-NonOSE_AE   malignancies≠I-NonOSE_AE  exceeds the duration of follow up for patients on the trial.



   Subsequent Treatment with Cytotoxic Chemotherapy

  In the randomized clinical trial, 16% patients in the Xofigo group and 18% patients in the placebo group received  cytotoxic≠B-NonOSE_AE   chemotherapy≠I-NonOSE_AE  after completion of study treatments. Adequate safety monitoring and laboratory testing was not performed to assess how patients treated with Xofigo will tolerate subsequent  cytotoxic≠B-NonOSE_AE   chemotherapy≠I-NonOSE_AE .
