  6.1       Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 A total of 162  Cushing≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  s≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  patients were exposed to SIGNIFOR in the Phase III study   [see Clinical Studies (14)]  . At study entry, patients were randomized to receive twice a day (b.i.d.) doses of either 0.6 mg or 0.9 mg of SIGNIFOR given subcutaneously. The mean age of patients was approximately 40 years old with a predominance of female patients (78%). The majority of the patients had persistent or recurrent  Cushing≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  s≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  (83%) and few patients (<= 5%) in either treatment group had received previous pituitary irradiation. The median exposure to the treatment was 10.4 months (0.03-37.8) with 68% of patients having at least six-months exposure.



 In the Phase III trial, adverse reactions were reported in 98% of patients. The most common adverse reactions (frequency >= 20% in either group) were  diarrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  nausea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  hyperglycemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  cholelithiasis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  headache≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  abdominal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  fatigue≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  diabetes≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   mellitus≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . There were no deaths during the study. Serious adverse events were reported in 25% of patients. Adverse events leading to study discontinuation were reported in 17% of patients.



 Adverse reactions with an overall frequency higher than 5% are presented in Table 1 by randomized dose group and overall. Adverse reactions are ranked by frequency, with the most frequent reactions listed first.

   Gastrointestinal Disorders  



  Gastrointestinal≠B-NonOSE_AE   disorders≠I-NonOSE_AE , predominantly  diarrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  nausea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  abdominal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  vomiting≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  were reported frequently in the Phase III trial (see Table 1). These events began to develop primarily during the first month of treatment with SIGNIFOR and required no intervention.



   Hyperglycemia and Diabetes  



  Hyperglycemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  related≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   terms≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  were reported frequently in the Phase III trial. For all patients, these terms included:  hyperglycemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (40%),  diabetes≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   mellitus≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (18%),  increased≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   HbA≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  1≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  c≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (11%), and  type≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   2≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   diabetes≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   mellitus≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (9%). In general,  increases≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   fasting≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   plasma≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   glucose≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  FPG≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) were seen soon after initiation of SIGNIFOR and were sustained during the treatment period. In the SIGNIFOR 0.6 mg group, mean  fasting≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   plasma≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   glucose≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  FPG≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  )≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   levels≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   increased≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  from 98.6 mg/dL at baseline to 125.1 mg/dL at Month 6. In the SIGNIFOR 0.9 mg group, mean  fasting≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   plasma≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   glucose≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  FPG≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  )≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   levels≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   increased≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  from 97.0 mg/dL at baseline to 128.0 mg/dL at Month 6. In the SIGNIFOR 0.6 mg group,  HbA≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  1≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  c≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   increased≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  from 5.8% at baseline to 7.2% at Month 6. In the SIGNIFOR 0.9 mg group,  HbA≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  1≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  c≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   increased≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  from 5.8% at baseline to 7.3% at Month 6  [see Warning and Precautions (5.2)]  .



 At one-month follow-up visits following discontinuation of SIGNIFOR,  mean≠B-NonOSE_AE   FPG≠I-NonOSE_AE  and HbA1c  levels≠I-NonOSE_AE   decreased≠I-NonOSE_AE  but remained above baseline values. Long-term follow-up data are not available.



   Elevated Liver Tests  



 In the Phase III trial, there were transient mean  elevations≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   aminotransferase≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  values in patients treated with SIGNIFOR. Mean values returned to baseline levels by Month 4 of treatment. The elevations were not associated with clinical symptoms of  hepatic≠B-NonOSE_AE   disease≠I-NonOSE_AE .



 In the clinical development program of SIGNIFOR, there were 4 patients with concurrent  elevations≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   ALT≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  greater than 3 x ULN and bilirubin greater than 2 x ULN: one patient with  Cushing≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  s≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and three healthy volunteers  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]  . In all four cases, the elevations were noted within the first 10 days of treatment. In all of these cases,  total≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   bilirubin≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   elevations≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  were seen either concomitantly or preceding the  transaminase≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   elevation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . The patient with  Cushing≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  s≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  developed  jaundice≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . All four cases had resolution of the  laboratory≠B-NonOSE_AE   abnormalities≠I-NonOSE_AE  with discontinuation of SIGNIFOR.



   Hypocortisolism  



 Cases of  hypocortisolism≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  were reported in the Phase III study in  Cushing≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  s≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  patients  [see Adverse Reactions (6) and Clinical Studies (14)]  . The majority of cases were manageable by reducing the dose of SIGNIFOR and/or adding low-dose, short-term glucocorticoid therapy  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]  .



   Injection Site Reactions  



  Injection≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   site≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  were reported in 17% of patients enrolled in the Phase III trial in  Cushing≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  s≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . The events were most frequently reported as  local≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  pain,  erythema≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , hematoma, hemorrhage, and pruritus. These events resolved spontaneously and required no intervention.



   Thyroid Function  



  Hypothyroidism≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  with the use of SIGNIFOR was reported for seven patients participating in the Phase III study in  Cushing≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  s≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . All seven patients presented with a  TSH≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   close≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   to≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   or≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   below≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   the≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   lower≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   limit≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  at study entry which precludes establishing a conclusive relationship between the adverse event and the use of SIGNIFOR.



   Other Abnormal Laboratory Findings  



 Asymptomatic and reversible  elevations≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  in  lipase≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and amylase were observed in patients receiving SIGNIFOR in clinical studies.  Pancreatitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  is a potential adverse reaction associated with the use of somatostatin analogs due to the association between  cholelithiasis≠B-NonOSE_AE  and  acute≠B-NonOSE_AE   pancreatitis≠I-NonOSE_AE .



 For hemoglobin levels, mean decreases that remained within normal range were observed. Also, post-baseline  elevations≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   PT≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and PTT were noted in 33% and 47% of patients, respectively. The  PT≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and PTT  elevations≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  were minimal. 



 These laboratory findings are of unclear clinical significance.
