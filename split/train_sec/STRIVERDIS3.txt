    5  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Do not initiate STRIVERDI RESPIMAT in acutely deteriorating COPD patients (  5.2  ) 
 *  Do not use for relief of acute symptoms. Concomitant short-acting beta2-agonists can be used as needed for acute relief. (  5.2  ) 
 *  Do not exceed the recommended dose. Excessive use of STRIVERDI RESPIMAT, or use in conjunction with other medications containing LABA can result in clinically significant cardiovascular effects and may be fatal. (  5.3  ) 
 *  Life-threatening paradoxical bronchospasm can occur. Discontinue STRIVERDI RESPIMAT immediately. (  5.4  ) 
 *  Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular or convulsive disorders, thyrotoxicosis or sensitivity to sympathomimetic drugs (  5.5  ,  5.6  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Asthma-Related Death [ see Boxed Warning  ]



    *   Data from a large placebo-controlled study in  asthma≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  patients showed that long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists may increase the risk of  asthma≠B-NonOSE_AE -related  death≠B-NonOSE_AE . Data are not available to determine whether the rate of  death≠B-NonOSE_AE  in patients with  COPD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  is increased by long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists.  
 *   A 28-week, placebo-controlled US study comparing the safety of another long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist (salmeterol) with placebo, each added to usual  asthma≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  therapy, showed an increase in  asthma≠B-NonOSE_AE -related  deaths≠B-NonOSE_AE  in patients receiving salmeterol (13/13,176 in patients treated with salmeterol vs. 3/13,179 in patients treated with placebo; RR 4.37, 95% CI 1.25, 15.34). The increased risk of  asthma≠B-NonOSE_AE -related  death≠B-NonOSE_AE  is considered a class effect of long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists, including STRIVERDI RESPIMAT. No study adequate to determine whether the rate of  asthma≠B-NonOSE_AE -related  death≠B-NonOSE_AE  is increased in patients treated with STRIVERDI RESPIMAT has been conducted. The safety and efficacy of STRIVERDI RESPIMAT in patients with  asthma≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  have not been established. STRIVERDI RESPIMAT is not indicated for the treatment of  asthma≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  [ see Contraindications (  4  ) ].  
       5.2 Deterioration of Disease and Acute Episodes
 

  STRIVERDI RESPIMAT should not be initiated in patients with  acutely≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   deteriorating≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   COPD≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , which may be a life-threatening condition. STRIVERDI RESPIMAT has not been studied in patients with  acutely≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   deteriorating≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   COPD≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . The use of STRIVERDI RESPIMAT in this setting is inappropriate.



 STRIVERDI RESPIMAT should not be used for the relief of acute symptoms, i.e., as rescue therapy for the treatment of acute episodes of  bronchospasm≠B-NonOSE_AE . STRIVERDI RESPIMAT has not been studied in the relief of acute symptoms and extra doses should not be used for that purpose. Acute symptoms should be treated with an inhaled short-acting beta2-agonist.



 When beginning STRIVERDI RESPIMAT, patients who have been taking inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonists on a regular basis (e.g., four times a day) should be instructed to discontinue the regular use of these drugs and use them only for symptomatic relief of acute  respiratory≠B-NonOSE_AE   symptoms≠I-NonOSE_AE . When prescribing STRIVERDI RESPIMAT, the healthcare provider should also prescribe an inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist and instruct the patient on how it should be used. Increasing inhaled beta2-agonist use is a signal of deteriorating disease for which prompt medical attention is indicated.



  COPD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  may deteriorate acutely over a period of hours or chronically over several days or longer. If STRIVERDI RESPIMAT no longer controls symptoms of  bronchoconstriction≠B-NonOSE_AE , or the patient's inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist becomes less effective or the patient needs more inhalation of short-acting beta2-agonist than usual, these may be markers of deterioration of disease. In this setting, a re-evaluation of the patient and the  COPD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  treatment regimen should be undertaken at once. Increasing the daily dosage of STRIVERDI RESPIMAT beyond the recommended dose is not appropriate in this situation.



    5.3 Excessive Use of STRIVERDI RESPIMAT and Use with Long-Acting Beta2-Agonists



  As with other inhaled drugs containing beta2-adrenergic agents, STRIVERDI RESPIMAT should not be used more often than recommended, at higher doses than recommended, or in conjunction with other medications containing long-acting beta2-agonists, as an  overdose≠B-NonOSE_AE  may result. Clinically significant  cardiovascular≠B-NonOSE_AE   effects≠I-NonOSE_AE  and  fatalities≠B-NonOSE_AE  have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs.



    5.4 Paradoxical Bronchospasm



  As with other inhaled beta2-agonists, STRIVERDI RESPIMAT may produce  paradoxical≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   bronchospasm≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  that may be life-threatening. If  paradoxical≠B-NonOSE_AE   bronchospasm≠I-NonOSE_AE  occurs, STRIVERDI RESPIMAT should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy instituted.



    5.5 Cardiovascular Effects



  STRIVERDI RESPIMAT, like other beta2-agonists, can produce a clinically significant  cardiovascular≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   effect≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  in some patients as measured by  increases≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  in pulse rate,  systolic≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  or diastolic  blood≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   pressure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and/or symptoms. If such effects occur, STRIVERDI RESPIMAT may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta-agonists have been reported to produce  ECG≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   changes≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , such as  flattening≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   t≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE he T  wave≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  prolongation≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   the≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   QTc≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   interval≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  ST≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   segment≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   depression≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Long acting beta2-adrenergic agonists should be administered with caution in patients with  cardiovascular≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorders≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , especially  coronary≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   insufficiency≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  cardiac≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   arrhythmias≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  hypertrophic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   obstructive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   cardiomyopathy≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , and  hypertension≠B-Not_AE_Candidate .



    5.6 Co-existing Conditions



  STRIVERDI RESPIMAT, like other sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with  convulsive≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorders≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  or  thyrotoxicosis≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , in patients with known or suspected  prolongation≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  of the  QT≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   interval≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , and in patients who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines. Doses of the related beta2-agonist albuterol, when administered intravenously, have been reported to  aggravate≠B-NonOSE_AE   pre≠I-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  existing≠I-NonOSE_AE   diabetes≠I-NonOSE_AE   mellitus≠I-NonOSE_AE  and  ketoacidosis≠B-NonOSE_AE .



    5.7 Hypokalemia and Hyperglycemia



  Beta-adrenergic agonists may produce significant  hypokalemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  in some patients, which has the potential to produce adverse  cardiovascular≠B-NonOSE_AE   effects≠I-NonOSE_AE  [ see Clinical Pharmacology (  12.2  )  ]. The  decrease≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   serum≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   potassium≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  is usually transient, not requiring supplementation. Inhalation of high doses of beta2-adrenergic agonists may produce  increases≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   plasma≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   glucose≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE .



 In patients with severe  COPD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ,  hypokalemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  may be potentiated by  hypoxia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and concomitant treatment [ see Drug Interactions (  7.2  )  ], which may increase the susceptibility for  cardiac≠B-NonOSE_AE   arrhythmias≠I-NonOSE_AE .



 Clinically notable  decreases≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   serum≠I-NonOSE_AE   potassium≠I-NonOSE_AE  or  changes≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   blood≠I-NonOSE_AE   glucose≠I-NonOSE_AE  were infrequent during clinical studies with long-term administration of STRIVERDI RESPIMAT with the rates similar to those for placebo controls. STRIVERDI RESPIMAT has not been investigated in patients whose  diabetes≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   mellitus≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  is not well controlled.



    5.8 Hypersensitivity Reactions



  Immediate  hypersensitivity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , including  angioedema≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , may occur after administration of STRIVERDI RESPIMAT. If such a reaction occurs, therapy with STRIVERDI RESPIMAT should be stopped at once and alternative treatment should be considered.
