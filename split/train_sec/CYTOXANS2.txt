   5.1 Myelosuppression, Immunosuppression, Bone Marrow Failure and Infections

  Cyclophosphamide can cause  myelosuppression≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  ( leukopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  neutropenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  thrombocytopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  anemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ),  bone≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   marrow≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   failure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and severe  immunosuppression≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  which may lead to serious and sometimes  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE   infections≠B-NonOSE_AE , including  sepsis≠B-NonOSE_AE  and  septic≠B-NonOSE_AE   shock≠I-NonOSE_AE .  Latent≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   infections≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   can≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   be≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactivated≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ].

 Antimicrobial prophylaxis may be indicated in certain cases of  neutropenia≠B-NonOSE_AE  at the discretion of the managing physician. In case of  neutropenic≠B-NonOSE_AE   fever≠I-NonOSE_AE , antibiotic therapy is indicated. Antimycotics and/or antivirals may also be indicated.

 Monitoring of complete blood counts is essential during cyclophosphamide treatment so that the dose can be adjusted, if needed. Cyclophosphamide should not be administered to patients with  neutrophils≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   <≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  =≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  1≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  ,≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  5≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  0≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  0≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  /≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  mm≠I-Not_AE_Candidate    3≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   and  platelets≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   <≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   5≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  0≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  ,≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  0≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  0≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  0≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  /≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  mm≠I-Not_AE_Candidate    3≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   . Cyclophosphamide treatment may not be indicated, or should be interrupted, or the dose reduced, in patients who have or who develop a serious  infection≠B-NonOSE_AE . G-CSF may be administered to reduce the risks of  neutropenia≠B-NonOSE_AE  complications associated with cyclophosphamide use. Primary and secondary prophylaxis with G-CSF should be considered in all patients considered to be at increased risk for  neutropenia≠B-NonOSE_AE  complications. The nadirs of the  reduction≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   leukocyte≠I-NonOSE_AE   count≠I-NonOSE_AE  and thrombocyte count are usually reached in weeks 1 and 2 of treatment. Peripheral blood cell counts are expected to normalize after approximately 20 days.  Bone≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   marrow≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   failure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  has been reported. Severe  myelosuppression≠B-NonOSE_AE  may be expected particularly in patients pretreated with and/or receiving concomitant chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.

    5.2 Urinary Tract and Renal Toxicity

   Hemorrhagic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   cystitis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  pyelitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  ureteritis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  hematuria≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported with cyclophosphamide. Medical and/or surgical supportive treatment may be required to treat protracted cases of severe  hemorrhagic≠B-NonOSE_AE   cystitis≠I-NonOSE_AE . Discontinue cyclophosphamide therapy in case of severe  hemorrhagic≠B-NonOSE_AE   cystitis≠I-NonOSE_AE .  Urotoxicity≠B-NonOSE_AE  ( bladder≠B-NonOSE_AE   ulceration≠I-NonOSE_AE , necrosis, fibrosis, contracture and secondary cancer) may require interruption of cyclophosphamide treatment or cystectomy.  Urotoxicity≠B-NonOSE_AE  can be  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE .  Urotoxicity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  can occur with short-term or long-term use of cyclophosphamide.

 Before starting treatment, exclude or correct any  urinary≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   tract≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   obstructions≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  [see  Contraindications (4)  ]. Urinary sediment should be checked regularly for the presence of erythrocytes and other signs of  urotoxicity≠B-NonOSE_AE  and/or  nephrotoxicity≠B-NonOSE_AE . Cyclophosphamide should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active  urinary≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   tract≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   infections≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Aggressive hydration with forced  diuresis≠B-NonOSE_AE  and frequent  bladder≠B-NonOSE_AE   emptying≠I-NonOSE_AE  can reduce the frequency and severity of  bladder≠B-NonOSE_AE   toxicity≠I-NonOSE_AE . Mesna has been used to prevent severe  bladder≠B-NonOSE_AE   toxicity≠I-NonOSE_AE .

    5.3 Cardiotoxicity

   Myocarditis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  myopericarditis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  pericardial≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   effusion≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  including  cardiac≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   tamponade≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  congestive≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   heart≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   failure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , which may be  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE , have been reported with cyclophosphamide therapy

  Supraventricular≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   arrhythmias≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (including  atrial≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  fibrillation and  flutter≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ) and  ventricular≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   arrhythmias≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (including severe  QT≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   prolongation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  associated with  ventricular≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   tachyarrhythmia≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ) have been reported after treatment with regimens that included cyclophosphamide.

 The risk of  cardiotoxicity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  may be increased with high doses of cyclophosphamide, in patients with advanced age, and in patients with previous radiation treatment to the cardiac region and/or previous or concomitant treatment with other  cardiotoxic≠B-NonOSE_AE   agents≠I-NonOSE_AE .

 Particular caution is necessary in patients with risk factors for  cardiotoxicity≠B-NonOSE_AE  and in patients with pre-existing  cardiac≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate .

 Monitor patients with risk factors for  cardiotoxicity≠B-NonOSE_AE  and with pre-existing  cardiac≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate .

    5.4 Pulmonary Toxicity

   Pneumonitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  pulmonary≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   fibrosis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  pulmonary≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   veno≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  occlusive≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   disease≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and other forms of  pulmonary≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   toxicity≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  leading to  respiratory≠B-NonOSE_AE   failure≠I-NonOSE_AE  have been reported during and following treatment with cyclophosphamide. Late onset  pneumonitis≠B-NonOSE_AE  (greater than 6 months after start of cyclophosphamide) appears to be associated with increased  mortality≠B-NonOSE_AE .  Pneumonitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  may develop years after treatment with cyclophosphamide.

 Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of  pulmonary≠B-NonOSE_AE   toxicity≠I-NonOSE_AE .

    5.5 Secondary Malignancies

  Cyclophosphamide is  genotoxic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  [see  Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)  ].  Secondary≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   malignancies≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  ( urinary≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   tract≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   cancer≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  myelodysplasia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  acute≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   leukemias≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  lymphomas≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  thyroid≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   cancer≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  sarcomas≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ) have been reported in patients treated with cyclophosphamide-containing regimens .  The risk of  bladder≠B-NonOSE_AE   cancer≠I-NonOSE_AE  may be reduced by prevention of  hemorrhagic≠B-NonOSE_AE   cystitis≠I-NonOSE_AE .

    5.6 Veno-occlusive Liver Disease

   Veno≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  occlusive≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   liver≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   disease≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  VOD≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ) including  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE  outcome has been reported in patients receiving cyclophosphamide-containing regimens. A cytoreductive regimen in preparation for  bone≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   marrow≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   transplantation≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  that consists of cyclophosphamide in combination with whole-body irradiation, busulfan, or other agents has been identified as a major risk factor.  VOD≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  has also been reported to develop gradually in patients receiving long-term low-dose  immunosuppressive≠B-NonOSE_AE  doses of cyclophosphamide. Other risk factors predisposing to the development of  VOD≠B-NonOSE_AE  include preexisting  disturbances≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   of≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   hepatic≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   function≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , previous radiation therapy of the abdomen, and a low performance status.

    5.7  Embryo≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  Fetal≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   Toxicity≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE 

  Cyclophosphamide can cause  fetal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   harm≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  when administered to a  pregnant≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  woman [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ]. Exposure to cyclophosphamide during  pregnancy≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  may cause  birth≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   defects≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  miscarriage≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  fetal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   growth≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   retardation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  fetotoxic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   effects≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  in the newborn. Cyclophosphamide is  teratogenic≠B-NonOSE_AE  and  embryo≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  fetal≠I-NonOSE_AE   toxic≠I-NonOSE_AE  in mice, rats, rabbits and monkeys.

 Advise female patients of reproductive potential to avoid becoming  pregnant≠B-NonOSE_AE  and to use highly effective contraception during treatment and for up to 1 year after completion of therapy [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.6)  ].

    5.8 Infertility

   Male≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and female  reproductive≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   function≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and fertility may be  impaired≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  in patients being treated with cyclophosphamide. Cyclophosphamide  interferes≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   with≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   oogenesis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and spermatogenesis. It may cause  sterility≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  in both sexes. Development of  sterility≠B-NonOSE_AE  appears to depend on the dose of cyclophosphamide, duration of therapy, and the state of gonadal function at the time of treatment.  Cyclophosphamide≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  induced≠I-NonOSE_AE   sterility≠I-NonOSE_AE  may be irreversible in some patients. Advise patients on the potential risks for  infertility≠B-NonOSE_AE  [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.4  and  8.6  )].

    5.9 Impairment of Wound Healing

  Cyclophosphamide may  interfere≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   with≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   normal≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   wound≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   healing≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE .

    5.10 Hyponatremia

   Hyponatremia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  associated with  increased≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   total≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   body≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   water≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  acute≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   water≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   intoxication≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and a  syndrome≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   resembling≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   SIADH≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  syndrome≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   inappropriate≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   secretion≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   antidiuretic≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   hormone≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ), which may be  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE , has been reported.
