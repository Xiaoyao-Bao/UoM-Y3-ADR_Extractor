  WARNING:  HEPATOTOXICITY and RISK OF TERATOGENICITY

  EXCERPT:   WARNING:  HEPATOTOXICITY and RISK OF TERATOGENICITY



   See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning  



   Hepatotoxicity  



   Severe liver injury including fatal liver failure has been reported in patients treated with leflunomide, which is indicated for rheumatoid arthritis. A similar risk would be expected for teriflunomide because recommended doses of teriflunomide and leflunomide result in a similar range of plasma concentrations of teriflunomide. Obtain transaminase and bilirubin levels within 6 months before initiation of AUBAGIO and monitor ALT levels at least monthly for six months (  5.1  ). If drug induced liver injury is suspected, discontinue AUBAGIO and start accelerated elimination procedure (  5.3  ).   



   Risk of Teratogenicity  



   Based on animal data, AUBAGIO may cause major birth defects if used during pregnancy. AUBAGIO is contraindicated in pregnant women or women of childbearing potential who are not using reliable contraception. Pregnancy must be avoided during AUBAGIO treatment. (  4.2  ,   5.2  )  



 



  Hepatotoxicity

    Severe  liver≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   injury≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  including fatal  liver≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   failure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  has been reported in patients treated with leflunomide, which is indicated for  rheumatoid≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   arthritis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . A similar risk would be expected for teriflunomide because recommended doses of teriflunomide and leflunomide result in a similar range of plasma concentrations of teriflunomide. Concomitant use of AUBAGIO with other potentially  hepatotoxic≠B-NonOSE_AE  drugs may increase the risk of severe  liver≠B-NonOSE_AE   injury≠I-NonOSE_AE . Obtain transaminase and bilirubin levels within 6 months before initiation of AUBAGIO therapy. Monitor ALT levels at least monthly for six months after starting AUBAGIO   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ].   If  drug≠B-NonOSE_AE   induced≠I-NonOSE_AE   liver≠I-NonOSE_AE   injury≠I-NonOSE_AE  is suspected, discontinue AUBAGIO and start an accelerated elimination procedure with cholestyramine or charcoal   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  . AUBAGIO is contraindicated in patients with severe  hepatic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   impairment≠I-Not_AE_Candidate    [see   Contraindications (4.1)  ]  . Patients with pre-existing  liver≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  may be at increased risk of developing  elevated≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   serum≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   transaminases≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  when taking AUBAGIO.

Pregnancy≠B-NonOSE_AE  must be excluded before starting AUBAGIO. AUBAGIO is contraindicated in  pregnant≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   women≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  or women of childbearing potential who are not using reliable contraception.  Pregnancy≠B-NonOSE_AE  must be avoided during AUBAGIO treatment or prior to the completion of an accelerated elimination procedure after AUBAGIO treatment   [see   Contraindications (4.2)  ,   Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  , and   Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ]  .
