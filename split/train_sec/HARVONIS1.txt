  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The safety assessment of HARVONI was based on pooled data from three Phase 3 clinical trials of subjects with  genotype≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   1≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   chronic≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   hepatitis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   C≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   (≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  CHC≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ) with  compensated≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   liver≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   (≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  with≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   and≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   without≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   cirrhosis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ) including 215, 539, and 326 subjects who received HARVONI for 8, 12 and 24 weeks, respectively  [see  Clinical Studies (14)  ].  



 The proportion of subjects who permanently discontinued treatment due to adverse events was 0%, <1%, and 1% for subjects receiving HARVONI for 8, 12, and 24 weeks, respectively.



 The most common adverse reactions (>=10%) were  fatigue≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  headache≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  in subjects treated with 8, 12, or 24 weeks of HARVONI.



 Table 2 lists adverse reactions (adverse events assessed as causally related by the investigator, all grades) observed in >=5% of subjects receiving 8, 12, or 24 weeks treatment with HARVONI in clinical trials. The majority of adverse reactions presented in Table 2 occurred at severity of grade 1. The side-by-side tabulation is to simplify presentation; direct comparison across trials should not be made due to differing trial designs.

      Lipase≠B-NonOSE_AE   Elevations≠I-NonOSE_AE :  Transient, asymptomatic  lipase≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   elevations≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  of greater than 3*ULN were observed in <1%, 2%, and 3% of subjects treated with HARVONI for 8, 12, and 24 weeks, respectively.



      Creatine≠B-NonOSE_AE   Kinase≠I-NonOSE_AE :   Creatine≠B-NonOSE_AE   kinase≠I-NonOSE_AE  was not assessed in Phase 3 trials of HARVONI. Isolated, asymptomatic  creatine≠B-NonOSE_AE   kinase≠I-NonOSE_AE   elevations≠I-NonOSE_AE  (Grade 3 or 4) have been previously reported in subjects treated with sofosbuvir in combination with ribavirin or peginterferon/ribavirin in other clinical trials.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of HARVONI. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



      Cardiac≠B-NonOSE_AE   Disorders≠I-NonOSE_AE   



 Serious symptomatic  bradycardia≠B-NonOSE_AE  has been reported in patients taking amiodarone who initiate treatment with HARVONI  [See  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ,  Drug Interactions (7.2)  ]
