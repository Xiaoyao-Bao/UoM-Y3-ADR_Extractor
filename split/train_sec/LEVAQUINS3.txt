   5.1 Disabling and Potentially Irreversible Serious Adverse Reactions Including Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture, Peripheral Neuropathy, and Central Nervous System Effects

   Fluoroquinolones, including LEVAQUIN, have been associated with disabling and potentially irreversible serious adverse reactions from different body systems that can occur together in the same patient. Commonly seen adverse reactions include  tendinitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  tendon≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   rupture≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  arthralgia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  myalgia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  peripheral≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   neuropathy≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  central≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   nervous≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   system≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   effects≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  ( hallucinations≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  anxiety≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  depression≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  insomnia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , severe  headaches≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  confusion≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ). These reactions can occur within hours to weeks after starting LEVAQUIN. Patients of any age or without pre-existing risk factors have experienced these adverse reactions [ see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2  ,  5.3  ,  5.4)    ].  

  Discontinue LEVAQUIN immediately at the first signs or symptoms of any serious adverse reaction. In addition, avoid the use of fluoroquinolones, including LEVAQUIN, in patients who have experienced any of these serious adverse reactions associated with fluoroquinolones.  

    5.2 Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture

  Fluoroquinolones, including LEVAQUIN  (r)  , have been associated with an increased risk of  tendinitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  tendon≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   rupture≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  in all ages [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ]  . This adverse reaction most frequently involves the Achilles tendon And has also been reported with the rotator cuff (the shoulder), the hand, the biceps, the thumb, and other tendon sites.  Tendinitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  or  tendon≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   rupture≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  can occur within hours or days of starting LEVAQUIN or as long as several months after completion of fluoroquinolone therapy.  Tendinitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  tendon≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   rupture≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  can occur bilaterally.

 The risk of developing  fluoroquinolone≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  associated≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   tendinitis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  tendon≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   rupture≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  is increased in patients over 60 years of age, in those taking corticosteroid drugs, and in patients with kidney, heart or lung transplants. Other factors that may independently increase the risk of  tendon≠B-NonOSE_AE   rupture≠I-NonOSE_AE  include strenuous physical activity,  renal≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   failure≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , and previous  tendon≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorders≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  such as  rheumatoid≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   arthritis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate .  Tendinitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  tendon≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   rupture≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported in patients taking fluoroquinolones who do not have the above risk factors. Discontinue LEVAQUIN  (r)  immediately if the patient experiences  pain≠B-NonOSE_AE , swelling, inflammation or rupture  of≠I-NonOSE_AE   a≠I-NonOSE_AE   tendon≠I-NonOSE_AE . Patients should be advised to rest at the first sign of  tendinitis≠B-NonOSE_AE  or  tendon≠B-NonOSE_AE   rupture≠I-NonOSE_AE , and to contact their healthcare provider regarding changing to a non-quinolone antimicrobial drug. Avoid LEVAQUIN in patients who have a history of  tendon≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorders≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  or  tendon≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   rupture≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  [see  Adverse Reactions (6.3)    ;   Patient Counseling Information (17)  ]  .

    5.3 Peripheral Neuropathy

  Fluoroquinolones, including LEVAQUIN, have been associated with an increased risk of  peripheral≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   neuropathy≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . Cases of  sensory≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  or sensorimotor  axonal≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   polyneuropathy≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  affecting small and/or large axons resulting in  paresthesias≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  hypoesthesias≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  dysesthesias≠B-NonOSE_AE  and  weakness≠B-NonOSE_AE  have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones, including LEVAQUIN  (r)  . Symptoms may occur soon after initiation of LEVAQUIN  (r)  and may be irreversible in some patients [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1  ,  6.2)  ]  .

 Discontinue LEVAQUIN  (r)  immediately if the patient experiences symptoms of  neuropathy≠B-NonOSE_AE  including  pain≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  burning≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  tingling≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  numbness≠B-NonOSE_AE , and/or  weakness≠B-NonOSE_AE  or other  alterations≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   sensation≠I-NonOSE_AE  including light touch, pain, temperature, position sense, and  vibratory≠B-NonOSE_AE   sensation≠I-NonOSE_AE . Avoid fluoroquinolones, including LEVAQUIN, in patients who have previously experienced  peripheral≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   neuropathy≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  [see  Adverse Reactions (6)    ,   Patient Counseling Information (17)  ]  .

    5.4 Central Nervous System Effects

   Fluoroquinolones, including LEVAQUIN, have been associated with an increased risk of  central≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   nervous≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   system≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  CNS≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  )≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   effects≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , including  convulsions≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  toxic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   psychoses≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  increased≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   intracranial≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   pressure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (including  pseudotumor≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   cerebri≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ) . Fluoroquinolones may also cause  central≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   nervous≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   system≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   stimulation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  which may lead to  tremors≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  restlessness≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  anxiety≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  lightheadedness≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  confusion≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  hallucinations≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  paranoia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  depression≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  nightmares≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  insomnia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .  Suicidal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   thoughts≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  attempted≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   or≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   completed≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   suicide≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  may also occur, especially in patients with a medical history of  depression≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , or an underlying risk factor for  depression≠B-Not_AE_Candidate . These reactions may occur following the first dose. If these reactions occur in patients receiving LEVAQUIN  (r)  , discontinue LEVAQUIN and institute appropriate measures. As with other fluoroquinolones, LEVAQUIN  (r)  should be used with caution in patients with a known or suspected  central≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   nervous≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   system≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   (≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  CNS≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  )≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  that may predispose them to  seizures≠B-NonOSE_AE  or  lower≠B-NonOSE_AE   the≠I-NonOSE_AE   seizure≠I-NonOSE_AE   threshold≠I-NonOSE_AE  (e.g., severe  cerebral≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   arteriosclerosis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  epilepsy≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ) or in the presence of other risk factors that may predispose them to  seizures≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or  lower≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   the≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   seizure≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   threshold≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  (e.g., certain drug therapy,  renal≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   dysfunction≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ). [see  Adverse Reactions (6)    ;   Drug Interactions (7.4    ,   7.5)    ;   Patient Counseling Information (17)  ]  .  

    5.5  Exacerbation≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   Myasthenia≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   Gravis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE 

  Fluoroquinolones, including LEVAQUIN  (r)  , have neuromuscular blocking activity and may  exacerbate≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   muscle≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   weakness≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  in patients with  myasthenia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   gravis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Postmarketing serious adverse reactions including  deaths≠B-NonOSE_AE  and requirement for ventilatory support, have been associated with fluoroquinolone use in patients with  myasthenia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   gravis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Avoid LEVAQUIN  (r)  in patients with a known history of  myasthenia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   gravis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  [see  Adverse Reactions (6.3)    ;   Patient Counseling Information (17)  ].  

    5.6 Other Serious and Sometimes Fatal Adverse Reactions

  Other serious and sometimes  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE  adverse reactions, some due to  hypersensitivity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and some due to uncertain etiology, have been reported rarely in patients receiving therapy with fluoroquinolones, including LEVAQUIN  (r)  . These events may be severe and generally occur following the administration of multiple doses. Clinical manifestations may include one or more of the following:

 *   fever≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  rash≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , or severe  dermatologic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (e.g.,  toxic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   epidermal≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   necrolysis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  Stevens≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  Johnson≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   Syndrome≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ); 
 *   vasculitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ;  arthralgia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ;  myalgia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ;  serum≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   sickness≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ; 
 *   allergic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pneumonitis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ; 
 *   interstitial≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   nephritis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ;  acute≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   renal≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  insufficiency or  failure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ; 
 *   hepatitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ;  jaundice≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ;  acute≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   hepatic≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  necrosis or  failure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ; 
 *   anemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , including  hemolytic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  aplastic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ;  thrombocytopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , including  thrombotic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   thrombocytopenic≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   purpura≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ;  leukopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ;  agranulocytosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ;  pancytopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ; and/or other  hematologic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   abnormalities≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . 
    Discontinue LEVAQUIN immediately at the first appearance of  skin≠B-NonOSE_AE   rash≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  jaundice≠B-NonOSE_AE , or any other sign of  hypersensitivity≠B-NonOSE_AE  and institute supportive measures [see  Adverse Reactions (6)  ;  Patient Counseling Information (17)  ]  .
 

    5.7 Hypersensitivity Reactions

  Serious and occasionally  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE   hypersensitivity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and/or  anaphylactic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported in patients receiving therapy with fluoroquinolones, including LEVAQUIN  (r)  . These reactions often occur following the first dose. Some reactions have been accompanied by  cardiovascular≠B-NonOSE_AE   collapse≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  hypotension≠B-NonOSE_AE / shock≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  seizure≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  loss≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   consciousness≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  tingling≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  angioedema≠B-NonOSE_AE  (including  tongue≠B-NonOSE_AE , laryngeal, throat, or facial edema/ swelling≠I-NonOSE_AE ),  airway≠B-NonOSE_AE   obstruction≠I-NonOSE_AE  (including  bronchospasm≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  shortness≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   breath≠I-NonOSE_AE , and  acute≠B-NonOSE_AE   respiratory≠I-NonOSE_AE   distress≠I-NonOSE_AE ),  dyspnea≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  urticaria≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  itching≠B-NonOSE_AE , and other serious  skin≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE . LEVAQUIN  (r)  should be discontinued immediately at the first appearance of a  skin≠B-NonOSE_AE   rash≠I-NonOSE_AE  or any other sign of  hypersensitivity≠B-NonOSE_AE . Serious acute  hypersensitivity≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE  may require treatment with epinephrine and other resuscitative measures, including oxygen, intravenous fluids, antihistamines, corticosteroids, pressor amines, and airway management, as clinically indicated [see  Adverse Reactions (6)  ;  Patient Counseling Information (17)  ]  .

    5.8 Hepatotoxicity

  Post-marketing reports of severe  hepatotoxicity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (including  acute≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   hepatitis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE  events) have been received for patients treated with LEVAQUIN  (r).  No evidence of serious  drug≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  associated≠I-NonOSE_AE   hepatotoxicity≠I-NonOSE_AE  was detected in clinical trials of over 7,000 patients. Severe  hepatotoxicity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  generally occurred within 14 days of initiation of therapy and most cases occurred within 6 days. Most cases of severe  hepatotoxicity≠B-NonOSE_AE  were not associated with  hypersensitivity≠B-NonOSE_AE  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.6)  ]  . The majority of  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE   hepatotoxicity≠B-NonOSE_AE  reports occurred in patients 65 years of age or older and most were not associated with  hypersensitivity≠B-NonOSE_AE . LEVAQUIN  (r)  should be discontinued immediately if the patient develops signs and symptoms of  hepatitis≠B-NonOSE_AE  [see  Adverse Reactions (6)  ;  Patient Counseling Information (17)  ].  

    5.9 Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea

    Clostridium≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   difficile≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE    -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  associated≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   diarrhea≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  CDAD≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including LEVAQUIN  (r)  , and may range in severity from mild  diarrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  to  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE   colitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . Treatment with antibacterial agents  alters≠B-NonOSE_AE   the≠I-NonOSE_AE   normal≠I-NonOSE_AE   flora≠I-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   the≠I-NonOSE_AE   colon≠I-NonOSE_AE  leading to  overgrowth≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   C≠I-NonOSE_AE  .≠I-NonOSE_AE   difficile≠I-NonOSE_AE   .

   C≠B-NonOSE_AE  .≠I-NonOSE_AE   difficile≠I-NonOSE_AE   produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of  CDAD≠B-NonOSE_AE . Hypertoxin producing strains of  C≠B-NonOSE_AE  .≠I-NonOSE_AE   difficile≠I-NonOSE_AE   cause increased morbidity and  mortality≠B-NonOSE_AE , as these  infections≠B-NonOSE_AE  can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy.  CDAD≠B-NonOSE_AE  must be considered in all patients who present with  diarrhea≠B-NonOSE_AE  following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since  CDAD≠B-NonOSE_AE  has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

 If  CDAD≠B-NonOSE_AE  is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against  C≠B-NonOSE_AE  .≠I-NonOSE_AE   difficile≠I-NonOSE_AE   may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of  C≠B-NonOSE_AE  .≠I-NonOSE_AE   difficile≠I-NonOSE_AE   , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)    ,   Patient Counseling Information (17)  ]  .

    5.10 Prolongation of the QT Interval

  Some fluoroquinolones, including LEVAQUIN  (r)  , have been associated with  prolongation≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   the≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   QT≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   interval≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  on the electrocardiogram and infrequent cases of  arrhythmia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . Rare cases of  torsade≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   de≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   pointes≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been spontaneously reported during postmarketing surveillance in patients receiving fluoroquinolones, including LEVAQUIN  (r)  . LEVAQUIN  (r)  should be avoided in patients with known  prolongation≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   of≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   the≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   QT≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   interval≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , patients with uncorrected  hypokalemia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , and patients receiving Class IA (quinidine, procainamide), or Class III (amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents. Elderly patients may be more susceptible to  drug≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  associated≠I-NonOSE_AE   effects≠I-NonOSE_AE   on≠I-NonOSE_AE   the≠I-NonOSE_AE   QT≠I-NonOSE_AE   interval≠I-NonOSE_AE  [see  Adverse Reactions (6.3)    ,   Use in Specific Populations (8.5)    , and   Patient Counseling Information (17)  ]  .

    5.11 Musculoskeletal Disorders in Pediatric Patients and Arthropathic Effects in Animals

  LEVAQUIN  (r)  is indicated in pediatric patients (6 months of age and older) only for the prevention of  inhalational≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   anthrax≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  (post-exposure) and for  plague≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  [see  Indications and Usage (1.7    ,   1.8)    ]. An increased incidence of  musculoskeletal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   disorders≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  ( arthralgia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  arthritis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  tendinopathy≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  gait≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   abnormality≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ) compared to controls has been observed in pediatric patients receiving LEVAQUIN  (r)   [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.4)  ]  .

 In immature rats and dogs, the oral and intravenous administration of levofloxacin resulted in increased  osteochondrosis≠B-NonOSE_AE . Histopathological examination of the weight-bearing joints of immature dogs dosed with levofloxacin revealed persistent  lesions≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   the≠I-NonOSE_AE   cartilage≠I-NonOSE_AE . Other fluoroquinolones also produce similar  erosions≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   the≠I-NonOSE_AE   weight≠I-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  bearing≠I-NonOSE_AE   joints≠I-NonOSE_AE  and other signs of  arthropathy≠B-NonOSE_AE  in immature animals of various species [see  Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology (13.2)  ]  .

    5.12 Blood Glucose Disturbances

  As with other fluoroquinolones,  disturbances≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   blood≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   glucose≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , including symptomatic  hyper≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE - and hypo glycemia≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , have been reported with LEVAQUIN  (r)  , usually in diabetic patients receiving concomitant treatment with an oral  hypoglycemic≠B-NonOSE_AE   agent≠I-NonOSE_AE  (e.g., glyburide) or with insulin. In these patients, careful monitoring of blood glucose is recommended. If a  hypoglycemic≠B-NonOSE_AE  reaction occurs in a patient being treated with LEVAQUIN  (r)  , LEVAQUIN  (r)  should be discontinued and appropriate therapy should be initiated immediately [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)    ;   Drug Interactions (7.3)    ;   Patient Counseling Information (17)  ]  .

    5.13 Photosensitivity/Phototoxicity

  Moderate to severe  photosensitivity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE /phototoxicity  reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , the latter of which may manifest as exaggerated  sunburn≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE  (e.g.,  burning≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  erythema≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  exudation≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  vesicles≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  blistering≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  edema≠B-NonOSE_AE ) involving areas exposed to light (typically the face, "V" area of the neck, extensor surfaces of the forearms, dorsa of the hands), can be associated with the use of fluoroquinolones after sun or UV light exposure. Therefore, excessive exposure to these sources of light should be avoided. Drug therapy should be discontinued if  photosensitivity≠B-NonOSE_AE / phototoxicity≠B-NonOSE_AE  occurs [see  Adverse Reactions (6.3)    ;   Patient Counseling Information (17)  ]  .

    5.14 Development of Drug Resistant Bacteria

  Prescribing LEVAQUIN  (r)  in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected  bacterial≠B-NonOSE_AE   infection≠I-NonOSE_AE  or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the  development≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   drug≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  resistant≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   bacteria≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  [see  Patient Counseling Information (17)  ]  .
