   CLARITHROMYCIN SHOULD NOT BE USED IN  PREGNANT≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  WOMEN EXCEPT IN CLINICAL CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE NO ALTERNATIVE THERAPY IS APPROPRIATE. IF  PREGNANCY≠B-NonOSE_AE  OCCURS WHILE TAKING THIS DRUG, THE PATIENT SHOULD BE APPRISED OF THE POTENTIAL  HAZARD≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   TO≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   THE≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   FETUS≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE .

     Hepatotoxicity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE 

   Hepatic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   dysfunction≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , including  increased≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   liver≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   enzymes≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  hepatocellular≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and/or cholestatic  hepatitis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , with or without  jaundice≠B-NonOSE_AE , has been reported with clarithromycin. This  hepatic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   dysfunction≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  may be severe and is usually reversible. In some instances,  hepatic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   failure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  with  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE  outcome has been reported and generally has been associated with serious underlying diseases and/or concomitant medications. Discontinue clarithromycin immediately if signs and symptoms of  hepatitis≠B-NonOSE_AE  occur.

    Drug Interactions

  Serious adverse reactions have been reported in patients taking clarithromycin concomitantly with CYP3A4 substrates. These include  colchicine≠B-NonOSE_AE   toxicity≠I-NonOSE_AE  with colchicine;  rhabdomyolysis≠B-NonOSE_AE  with simvastatin, lovastatin, and atorvastatin; and  hypotension≠B-NonOSE_AE  with calcium channel blockers metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., verapamil, amlodipine, diltiazem) (see CONTRAINDICATIONS  and PRECAUTIONS   -   Drug Interactions  ).

 Life-threatening and  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE   drug≠B-NonOSE_AE   interactions≠I-NonOSE_AE  have been reported in patients treated with clarithromycin and colchicine. Clarithromycin is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and this interaction may occur while using both drugs at their recommended doses. If co-administration of clarithromycin and colchicine is necessary in patients with normal renal and hepatic function, the dose of colchicine should be reduced. Patients should be monitored for clinical symptoms of  colchicine≠B-NonOSE_AE   toxicity≠I-NonOSE_AE . Concomitant administration of clarithromycin and colchicine is contraindicated in patients with  renal≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or hepatic  impairment≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  (see CONTRAINDICATIONS  and PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions  ).

     Clostridium difficile  Associated Diarrhea

    Clostridium≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   difficile≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE    associated≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   diarrhea≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  CDAD≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including BIAXIN, and may range in severity from mild  diarrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  to  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE   colitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of  C≠B-NonOSE_AE  .≠I-NonOSE_AE   difficile≠I-NonOSE_AE   .

   C≠B-NonOSE_AE  .≠I-NonOSE_AE   difficile≠I-NonOSE_AE   produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of  CDAD≠B-NonOSE_AE . Hypertoxin producing strains of  C≠B-NonOSE_AE  .≠I-NonOSE_AE   difficile≠I-NonOSE_AE   cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy.  CDAD≠B-NonOSE_AE  must be considered in all patients who present with  diarrhea≠B-NonOSE_AE  following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since  CDAD≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

 If  CDAD≠B-NonOSE_AE  is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against  C≠B-NonOSE_AE  .≠I-NonOSE_AE   difficile≠I-NonOSE_AE   may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of  C≠B-NonOSE_AE  .≠I-NonOSE_AE   difficile≠I-NonOSE_AE   , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

 For information about warnings of other drugs indicated in combination with BIAXIN, refer to the WARNINGS  section of their package inserts.

 Due to the risk for  QT≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   prolongation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  clarithromycin should be used with caution in patients with a medical condition associated with an increased tendency toward  QT≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   prolongation≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and  torsades≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   de≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   pointes≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   .

 In the event of severe acute  hypersensitivity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , such as  anaphylaxis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  Stevens≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  Johnson≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   Syndrome≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  toxic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   epidermal≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   necrolysis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  drug≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   rash≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   with≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   eosinophilia≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   and≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   systemic≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   symptoms≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  DRESS≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ), and  Henoch≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  Schonlein≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   purpura≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  clarithromycin therapy should be discontinued immediately and appropriate treatment should be urgently initiated.

    Oral Hypoglycemic Agents/Insulin

  The concomitant use of clarithromycin and oral hypoglycemic agents and/or insulin can result in significant  hypoglycemia≠B-NonOSE_AE . With certain  hypoglycemic≠B-NonOSE_AE  drugs such as nateglinide, pioglitazone, repaglinide and rosiglitazone, inhibition of CYP3A enzyme by clarithromycin may be involved and could cause  hypolgycemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  when used concomitantly. Careful monitoring of glucose is recommended.

    Oral Anticoagulants

  There is a risk of serious  hemorrhage≠B-NonOSE_AE  and significant  elevations≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   INR≠I-NonOSE_AE  and prothrombin time when clarithromycin is co-administered with warfarin. INR and prothrombin times should be frequently monitored while patients are receiving clarithromycin and oral anticoagulants concurrently.

    HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors

  Concomitant use of clarithromycin with lovastatin or simvastatin is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS  ). As with other macrolides, clarithromycin has been reported to increase concentrations of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Rare reports of  rhabdomyolysis≠B-NonOSE_AE  have been reported in patients taking these drugs concomitantly. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of  myopathy≠B-NonOSE_AE .

 Rare reports of  rhabdomyolysis≠B-NonOSE_AE  have also been reported in patients taking atorvastatin or rosuvastatin concomitantly with clarithromycin. When used with clarithromycin, atorvastatin or rosuvastatin should be administered in the lowest possible doses. Adjustment of the statin dose or use of a statin that is not dependent on CYP3A metabolism (e.g.fluvastatin or pravastatin) should be considered.
