  6.1  Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The safety evaluation of TRADJENTA 5 mg once daily in patients with  type≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   2≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   diabetes≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  is based on 14 placebo-controlled trials, 1 active-controlled study, and one study in patients with severe  renal≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   impairment≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . In the 14 placebo-controlled studies, a total of 3625 patients were randomized and treated with TRADJENTA 5 mg daily and 2176 with placebo. The mean exposure in patients treated with TRADJENTA across studies was 29.6 weeks. The maximum follow-up was 78 weeks.



 TRADJENTA 5 mg once daily was studied as monotherapy in three placebo-controlled trials of 18 and 24 weeks' duration and in five additional placebo-controlled studies lasting <=18 weeks. The use of TRADJENTA in combination with other antihyperglycemic agents was studied in six placebo-controlled trials: two with metformin (12 and 24 weeks' treatment duration); one with a sulfonylurea (18 weeks' treatment duration); one with metformin and sulfonylurea (24 weeks' treatment duration); one with pioglitazone (24 weeks' treatment duration); and one with insulin (primary endpoint at 24 weeks).



 In a pooled dataset of 14 placebo-controlled clinical trials, adverse reactions that occurred in >=2% of patients receiving TRADJENTA (n = 3625) and more commonly than in patients given placebo (n = 2176), are shown in Table 1. The overall incidence of adverse events with TRADJENTA were similar to placebo.

                    Number (%) of Patients

      Rates for other adverse reactions for TRADJENTA 5 mg vs placebo when TRADJENTA was used in combination with specific anti-diabetic agents were:  urinary≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   tract≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infection≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (3.1% vs 0%) and  hypertriglyceridemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (2.4% vs 0%) when TRADJENTA was used as add-on to sulfonylurea;  hyperlipidemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (2.7% vs 0.8%) and  weight≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   increased≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (2.3% vs 0.8%) when TRADJENTA was used as add-on to pioglitazone; and  constipation≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (2.1% vs 1%) when TRADJENTA was used as add-on to basal insulin therapy.
 

 Following 104 weeks' treatment in a controlled study comparing TRADJENTA with glimepiride in which all patients were also receiving metformin, adverse reactions reported in >=5% of patients treated with TRADJENTA (n = 776) and more frequently than in patients treated with a sulfonylurea (n = 775) were  back≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (9.1% vs 8.4%),  arthralgia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (8.1% vs 6.1%),  upper≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   respiratory≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   tract≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infection≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (8.0% vs 7.6%),  headache≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (6.4% vs 5.2%),  cough≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (6.1% vs 4.9%), and  pain≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   extremity≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (5.3% vs 3.9%).



 Other adverse reactions reported in clinical studies with treatment of TRADJENTA were  hypersensitivity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (e.g.,  urticaria≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  angioedema≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  localized≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  skin  exfoliation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , or  bronchial≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   hyperreactivity≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ), and  myalgia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . In the clinical trial program,  pancreatitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was reported in 15.2 cases per 10,000 patient year exposure while being treated with TRADJENTA compared with 3.7 cases per 10,000 patient year exposure while being treated with comparator (placebo and active comparator, sulfonylurea). Three additional cases of  pancreatitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  were reported following the last administered dose of linagliptin.



   

    Hypoglycemia  In the placebo-controlled studies, 199 (6.6%) of the total 2994 patients treated with TRADJENTA 5 mg reported  hypoglycemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  compared to 56 patients (3.6%) of 1546 placebo-treated patients. The incidence of  hypoglycemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  was similar to placebo when TRADJENTA was administered as monotherapy or in combination with metformin, or with pioglitazone. When TRADJENTA was administered in combination with metformin and a sulfonylurea, 181 of 792 (22.9%) patients reported  hypoglycemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  compared with 39 of 263 (14.8%) patients administered placebo in combination with metformin and a sulfonylurea. Adverse reactions of  hypoglycemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  were based on all reports of  hypoglycemia≠B-NonOSE_AE . A concurrent glucose measurement was not required or was normal in some patients. Therefore, it is not possible to conclusively determine that all these reports reflect true  hypoglycemia≠B-NonOSE_AE .



 In the study of patients receiving TRADJENTA as add-on therapy to a stable dose of insulin for up to 52 weeks (n=1261), no significant difference in the incidence of investigator reported  hypoglycemia≠B-NonOSE_AE , defined as all symptomatic or asymptomatic episodes with a self-measured  blood≠B-NonOSE_AE   glucose≠I-NonOSE_AE   <≠I-NonOSE_AE  =≠I-NonOSE_AE  7≠I-NonOSE_AE  0≠I-NonOSE_AE   mg≠I-NonOSE_AE  /≠I-NonOSE_AE  dL≠I-NonOSE_AE , was noted between the TRADJENTA- (31.4%) and placebo- (32.9%) treated groups. During the same time period, severe  hypoglycemic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   events≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , defined as requiring the assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon or other resuscitative actions, were reported in 11 (1.7%) of TRADJENTA treated patients and 7 (1.1%) of placebo treated patients. Events that were considered life-threatening or required hospitalization were reported in 3 (0.5%) patients on TRADJENTA and 1 (0.2%) on placebo.



   Use in  Renal≠B-NonOSE_AE   Impairment≠I-NonOSE_AE   TRADJENTA was compared to placebo as add-on to pre-existing antidiabetic therapy over 52 weeks in 133 patients with severe  renal≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   impairment≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  (estimated  GFR≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   <≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  3≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  0≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   mL≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  /≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  min≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ). For the initial 12 weeks of the study, background antidiabetic therapy was kept stable and included insulin, sulfonylurea, glinides, and pioglitazone. For the remainder of the trial, dose adjustments in antidiabetic background therapy were allowed.



 In general, the incidence of adverse events including severe  hypoglycemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was similar to those reported in other TRADJENTA trials. The observed incidence of  hypoglycemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was higher (TRADJENTA, 63% compared to placebo, 49%) due to an increase in asymptomatic  hypoglycemic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   events≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  especially during the first 12 weeks when background glycemic therapies were kept stable. Ten TRADJENTA-treated patients (15%) and 11 placebo-treated patients (17%) reported at least one episode of confirmed symptomatic  hypoglycemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  (accompanying finger stick glucose <=54 mg/dL). During the same time period, severe  hypoglycemic≠B-NonOSE_AE   events≠I-NonOSE_AE , defined as an event requiring the assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon or other resuscitative actions, were reported in 3 (4.4%) TRADJENTA-treated patients and 3 (4.6%) placebo-treated patients. Events that were considered life-threatening or required hospitalization were reported in 2 (2.9%) patients on TRADJENTA and 1 (1.5%) patient on placebo.



 Renal function as measured by mean eGFR and creatinine clearance did not change over 52 weeks' treatment compared to placebo.



     Laboratory Tests  

  Changes in laboratory findings were similar in patients treated with TRADJENTA 5 mg compared to patients treated with placebo.  Changes≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   laboratory≠I-NonOSE_AE   values≠I-NonOSE_AE  that occurred more frequently in the TRADJENTA group and  >  1% more than in the placebo group were  increases≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  in  uric≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   acid≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (1.3% in the placebo group, 2.7% in the TRADJENTA group).



 No clinically meaningful changes in vital signs were observed in patients treated with TRADJENTA.



   6.2  Postmarketing Experience

  Additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of TRADJENTA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
