   WARNINGS

   Bone≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   marrow≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   suppression≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  ( leukopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  neutropenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  thrombocytopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ) is dose-dependent and is also the dose-limiting toxicity. Peripheral blood counts should be frequently monitored during carboplatin injection treatment and, when appropriate, until recovery is achieved. Median nadir occurs at day 21 in patients receiving single agent carboplatin. In general, single intermittent courses of carboplatin should not be repeated until leukocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts have recovered.

 Since  anemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  is cumulative, transfusions may be needed during treatment with carboplatin, particularly in patients receiving prolonged therapy.

  Bone≠B-NonOSE_AE   marrow≠I-NonOSE_AE   suppression≠I-NonOSE_AE  is increased in patients who have received prior therapy, especially regimens including cisplatin.  Marrow≠B-NonOSE_AE   suppression≠I-NonOSE_AE  is also increased in patients with  impaired≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   kidney≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   function≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Initial carboplatin injection dosages in these patients should be appropriately reduced (see   DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION    ) and blood counts should be carefully monitored between courses. The use of carboplatin in combination with other  bone≠B-NonOSE_AE   marrow≠I-NonOSE_AE   suppressing≠I-NonOSE_AE  therapies must be carefully managed with respect to dosage and timing in order to minimize additive effects.

 Carboplatin has limited  nephrotoxic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  potential, but concomitant treatment with aminoglycosides has resulted in  increased≠B-NonOSE_AE   renal≠I-NonOSE_AE  and/or audiologic  toxicity≠I-NonOSE_AE , and caution must be exercised when a patient receives both drugs. Clinically significant  hearing≠B-NonOSE_AE   loss≠I-NonOSE_AE  has been reported to occur in pediatric patients when carboplatin was administered at higher than recommended doses in combination with other  ototoxic≠B-NonOSE_AE  agents.

 Carboplatin can induce  emesis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , which can be more severe in patients previously receiving  emetogenic≠B-NonOSE_AE  therapy. The incidence and intensity of  emesis≠B-NonOSE_AE  have been reduced by using premedication with antiemetics. Although no conclusive efficacy data exist with the following schedules of carboplatin, lengthening the duration of single intravenous administration to 24 hours or dividing the total dose over five consecutive daily pulse doses has resulted in reduced  emesis≠B-NonOSE_AE .

 Although  peripheral≠B-NonOSE_AE   neurotoxicity≠I-NonOSE_AE  is infrequent, its incidence is increased in patients older than 65 years and in patients previously treated with cisplatin. Pre-existing cisplatin-induced  neurotoxicity≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  does not worsen in about 70% of the patients receiving carboplatin as secondary treatment.

  Loss≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   vision≠I-NonOSE_AE , which can be complete for light and colors, has been reported after the use of carboplatin with doses higher than those recommended in the package insert. Vision appears to recover totally or to a significant extent within weeks of stopping these high doses.

 As in the case of other platinum-coordination compounds,  allergic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  to carboplatin have been reported. These may occur within minutes of administration and should be managed with appropriate supportive therapy. There is increased risk of  allergic≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE  including  anaphylaxis≠B-NonOSE_AE  in patients previously exposed to platinum therapy (see   CONTRAINDICATIONS    and   ADVERSE REACTIONS, Allergic Reactions    ).

 High dosages of carboplatin (more than 4 times the recommended dose) have resulted in severe  abnormalities≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   liver≠I-NonOSE_AE   function≠I-NonOSE_AE   tests≠I-NonOSE_AE .

 Carboplatin injection may cause  fetal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   harm≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  when administered to a  pregnant≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  woman. Carboplatin has been shown to be  embryotoxic≠B-NonOSE_AE  and  teratogenic≠B-NonOSE_AE  in rats. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in  pregnant≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  women. If this drug is used during  pregnancy≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , or if the patient becomes  pregnant≠B-NonOSE_AE  while receiving this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential  hazard≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   to≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   the≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   fetus≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming  pregnant≠B-NonOSE_AE .
