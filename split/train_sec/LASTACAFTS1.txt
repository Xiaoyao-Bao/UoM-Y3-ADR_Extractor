    6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



   EXCERPT:   The most common ocular adverse reactions, occurring in less than 4% of eyes treated with LASTACAFT  (r)  , were eye irritation, burning and/or stinging on instillation, eye redness, and eye pruritus. (  6.1  )

  6.1 Clinical Studies Experience

  The most frequent  ocular≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   adverse≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , occurring in less than 4% of eyes treated with LASTACAFT  (r)  , were  eye≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   irritation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , burning and/or stinging upon instillation,  eye≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   redness≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  eye≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pruritus≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE .



   6.2 Non-ocular Adverse Reactions

  The most frequent non-ocular adverse reactions, occurring in less than 3% of subjects with eyes treated with LASTACAFT  (r)  , were  nasopharyngitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  headache≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . Some of these events were similar to the underlying disease being studied.



   6.3 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of LASTACAFT  (r)  in clinical practice. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These reactions include:  eye≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   discharge≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  eye≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   swelling≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  erythema≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   eyelid≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  eyelid≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   edema≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  hypersensitivity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  somnolence≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .
