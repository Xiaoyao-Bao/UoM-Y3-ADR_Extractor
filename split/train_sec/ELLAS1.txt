  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



   ella  was studied in an open-label multicenter trial (Open-Label Study) and in a comparative, randomized, single-blind, multicenter trial (Single-Blind Comparative Study). In these studies, a total of 2,637 (1,533 + 1,104) women in the 30 mg ulipristal acetate groups were included in the safety analysis. The mean age of women who received ulipristal acetate was 24.5 years and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 25.3. The racial demographics of those enrolled were 67% Caucasian, 20% Black or African American, 2% Asian, and 12% other. 



 The most common adverse reactions (>= 10%) in the clinical trials for women receiving  ella  were  headache≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (18% overall) and  nausea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (12% overall) and  abdominal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and upper abdominal  pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (12% overall). Table 1 lists those adverse reactions that were reported in >= 5% of subjects in the clinical studies (  14  ).

           6.2 Postmarketing Experience
   The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of  ella:           Skin≠B-NonOSE_AE   and≠I-NonOSE_AE   Subcutaneous≠I-NonOSE_AE   Tissue≠I-NonOSE_AE   Disorders≠I-NonOSE_AE :  Acne≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
