   5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

   EXCERPT:    *   Clinical Worsening/Suicide Risk: Monitor for clinical worsening and suicide risk (  5.1  ). 
 *   Serotonin Syndrome: Risk increases with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs. Discontinue Effexor XR and initiate supportive treatment if serotonin syndrome occurs (  4.2  ,  5.2  ,  7.3  ). 
 *   Elevations in Blood Pressure: Control hypertension before initiating treatment. Monitor blood pressure regularly during treatment (  5.3  ). 
 *   Abnormal Bleeding: Effexor XR may increase risk of bleeding events. Caution patients about the risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of Effexor XR and NSAIDs, aspirin, or other drugs that affect coagulation (  5.4  ). 
 *   Angle Closure Glaucoma: Angle closure glaucoma has occurred in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles treated with antidepressants. (  5.5  ). 
 *   Activation of Mania/Hypomania: Use cautiously in patients with bipolar disorder. Caution patients about the risk of activation of mania/hypomania (  5.6  ). 
    
 

   5.1 Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults

  Patients with  major≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depressive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   (≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  MDD≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ), both adult and pediatric, may experience  worsening≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   their≠I-NonOSE_AE   depression≠I-NonOSE_AE  and/or the emergence of  suicidal≠B-NonOSE_AE   ideation≠I-NonOSE_AE  and behavior ( suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE ) or  unusual≠B-NonOSE_AE   changes≠I-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   behavior≠I-NonOSE_AE , whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs.  Suicide≠B-NonOSE_AE  is a known risk of  depression≠B-NonOSE_AE  and certain other  psychiatric≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorders≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of  suicide≠B-NonOSE_AE . There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing  worsening≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   depression≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and the emergence of  suicidality≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled studies of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of  suicidal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  thinking and  behavior≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  ( suicidality≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18-24) with  MDD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and other  psychiatric≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorders≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE  with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.

 The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled studies in children and adolescents with  MDD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ,  Obsessive≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   Compulsive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   Disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   (≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  OCD≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ), or other  psychiatric≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorders≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  included a total of 24 short-term studies of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4,400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled studies in adults with  MDD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or other  psychiatric≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorders≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  included a total of 295 short-term studies (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of  suicidality≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE  across the different indications, with the highest incidence in  MDD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate . The risk differences (drug versus placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE  per 1,000 patients treated) are provided in Table 1.

 Table 1: Difference in the Number of Cases of  Suicidality≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  per 1,000 Patients Treated versus Placebo 
                Age Range                                 Increases Compared to Placebo                   
                   < 18                                        14 additional cases                        
                  18-24                                         5 additional cases                        
                                                          Decreases Compared to Placebo                   
                  25-64                                            1 fewer case                           
                  >= 65                                           6 fewer cases                           
        No  suicides≠B-NonOSE_AE  occurred in any of the pediatric studies. There were  suicides≠B-NonOSE_AE  in the adult studies, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on  suicide≠B-NonOSE_AE .
 

 It is unknown whether the  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE  risk extends to longer term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance studies in adults with  depression≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of  depression≠B-NonOSE_AE .

 All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening,  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE , and  unusual≠B-NonOSE_AE   changes≠I-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   behavior≠I-NonOSE_AE , especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases.

 The following symptoms,  anxiety≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  agitation≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  panic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   attacks≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  insomnia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  irritability≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  hostility≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  aggressiveness≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  impulsivity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  akathisia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  ( psychomotor≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   restlessness≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ),  hypomania≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  mania≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for  MDD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of  depression≠B-NonOSE_AE  and/or the emergence of  suicidal≠B-NonOSE_AE   impulses≠I-NonOSE_AE  has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE .

 Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose  depression≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE  or symptoms that might be precursors to  worsening≠B-NonOSE_AE   depression≠I-NonOSE_AE  or  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE , especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.

 If the decision has been made to discontinue treatment, medication should be tapered, as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that abrupt  discontinuation≠B-NonOSE_AE   can≠I-NonOSE_AE   be≠I-NonOSE_AE   associated≠I-NonOSE_AE   with≠I-NonOSE_AE   certain≠I-NonOSE_AE   symptoms≠I-NonOSE_AE  [ see  Warnings and Precautions (5.7)  and  Dosage and Administration (2.8)    ].

 Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for  MDD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or other indications, both  psychiatric≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of  agitation≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  irritability≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  unusual≠B-NonOSE_AE   changes≠I-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   behavior≠I-NonOSE_AE , and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE , and to report such symptoms immediately to healthcare providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers .  Prescriptions for Effexor XR should be written for the smallest quantity of capsules consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of  overdose≠B-NonOSE_AE .

    Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder  

 A  major≠B-NonOSE_AE   depressive≠I-NonOSE_AE   episode≠I-NonOSE_AE  may be the initial presentation of  bipolar≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . It is generally believed (though not established in controlled studies) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of  precipitation≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   a≠I-NonOSE_AE   mixed≠I-NonOSE_AE  /≠I-NonOSE_AE  manic≠I-NonOSE_AE   episode≠I-NonOSE_AE  in patients at risk for  bipolar≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with  depressive≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   symptoms≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for  bipolar≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ; such screening should include a detailed  psychiatric≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  history, including a  family≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   history≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   of≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   suicide≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  bipolar≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , and  depression≠B-Not_AE_Candidate . It should be noted that Effexor XR is not approved for use in treating  bipolar≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depression≠I-Not_AE_Candidate .

    5.2 Serotonin Syndrome

  The development of a potentially life-threatening  serotonin≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   syndrome≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  has been reported with SNRIs and SSRIs, including Effexor XR alone, but particularly with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John's wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat  psychiatric≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorders≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and others, such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue).

  Serotonin≠B-NonOSE_AE   syndrome≠I-NonOSE_AE  symptoms may include  mental≠B-NonOSE_AE   status≠I-NonOSE_AE   changes≠I-NonOSE_AE  (e.g.,  agitation≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  hallucinations≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  delirium≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  coma≠B-NonOSE_AE )  autonomic≠B-NonOSE_AE   instability≠I-NonOSE_AE  (e.g.,  tachycardia≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  labile≠B-NonOSE_AE   blood≠I-NonOSE_AE   pressure≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  hyperthermia≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  diaphoresis≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  flushing≠B-NonOSE_AE , and  dizziness≠B-NonOSE_AE ),  neuromuscular≠B-NonOSE_AE   symptoms≠I-NonOSE_AE  (e.g.,  tremor≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  rigidity≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  myoclonus≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  hyperreflexia≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  incoordination≠B-NonOSE_AE );  seizures≠B-NonOSE_AE  and  gastrointestinal≠B-NonOSE_AE   symptoms≠I-NonOSE_AE  (e.g.,  nausea≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  vomiting≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  diarrhea≠B-NonOSE_AE ). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of  serotonin≠B-NonOSE_AE   syndrome≠I-NonOSE_AE .

 The concomitant use of Effexor XR with MAOIs (intended to treat  psychiatric≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorders≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ) is contraindicated. Effexor XR should also not be started in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. All reports with methylene blue that provided information on the route of administration involved intravenous administration in the dose range of 1 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection) or at lower doses. There may be circumstances when it is necessary to initiate treatment with a MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking Effexor XR. Effexor XR should be discontinued before initiating treatment with the MAOI [ see  Contraindications (4.2)  ,  Dosage and Administration (2.6)  , and  Drug Interactions (7.3)    ].

 If concomitant use of Effexor XR with other serotonergic drugs (e.g., triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, buspirone, amphetamines, tryptophan, or St. John's wort) is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases [ see  Drug Interactions (7.3)    ]. Patients should be made aware of the potential risk of  serotonin≠B-NonOSE_AE   syndrome≠I-NonOSE_AE . Treatment with Effexor XR and any concomitant serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately if the above events occur, and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated.

    5.3 Elevations in Blood Pressure

  In controlled trials, there were dose-related  increases≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  systolic and  diastolic≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   blood≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   pressure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , as well as cases of sustained  hypertension≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ].  

 Monitor blood pressure before initiating treatment with Effexor XR and regularly during treatment. Control pre-existing  hypertension≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  before initiating treatment with Effexor XR. Use caution in treating patients with pre-existing  hypertension≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or  cardiovascular≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or cerebrovascular  conditions≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  that might be compromised by  increases≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   blood≠I-NonOSE_AE   pressure≠I-NonOSE_AE . Sustained  blood≠B-NonOSE_AE   pressure≠I-NonOSE_AE   elevation≠I-NonOSE_AE  can lead to adverse outcomes. Cases of  elevated≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   blood≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   pressure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  requiring immediate treatment have been reported with Effexor XR. Consider dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment for patients who experience a sustained  increase≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   blood≠I-NonOSE_AE   pressure≠I-NonOSE_AE .

 Across all clinical studies with Effexor, 1.4% of patients in the Effexor XR treated groups experienced a >=15 mm Hg  increase≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   supine≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   diastolic≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   blood≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   pressure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (SDBP ) >= 105 mm Hg, compared to 0.9% of patients in the placebo groups. Similarly, 1% of patients in the Effexor XR treated groups experienced a >= 20 mm Hg  increase≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   supine≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   systolic≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   blood≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   pressure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (SSBP) with  blood≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pressure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   >≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  =≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   1≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  8≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  0≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   mm≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   Hg≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , compared to 0.3% of patients in the placebo groups [ see  Table 10 in Adverse Reactions (6.2)    ]. Effexor XR treatment was associated with  sustained≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   hypertension≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (defined as treatment-emergent  SDBP≠B-NonOSE_AE   >≠I-NonOSE_AE  =≠I-NonOSE_AE   9≠I-NonOSE_AE  0≠I-NonOSE_AE   mm≠I-NonOSE_AE   Hg≠I-NonOSE_AE  and >= 10 mm Hg above baseline for three consecutive on-therapy visits [ see  Table 11 in Adverse Reactions (6.2)    ]. An insufficient number of patients received mean doses of Effexor XR over 300 mg per day in clinical studies to fully evaluate the incidence of sustained  increases≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   blood≠I-NonOSE_AE   pressure≠I-NonOSE_AE  at these higher doses.

    5.4 Abnormal Bleeding

  SSRIs and SNRIs, including Effexor XR, may increase the risk of  bleeding≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  events, ranging from  ecchymoses≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  hematomas≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  epistaxis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  petechiae≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  gastrointestinal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   hemorrhage≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  to life-threatening  hemorrhage≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . Concomitant use of aspirin, Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), warfarin, and other anti-coagulants or other drugs known to affect platelet function may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of  gastrointestinal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   bleeding≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . Caution patients about the risk of  bleeding≠B-NonOSE_AE  associated with the concomitant use of Effexor XR and NSAIDs, aspirin, or other drugs that affect coagulation.

    5.5 Angle-Closure Glaucoma

  The  pupillary≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   dilation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including Effexor XR may trigger an  angle≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   closure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   attack≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  in a patient with  anatomically≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   narrow≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   angles≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  who does not have a patent iridectomy.

    5.6 Activation of Mania/Hypomania

   Mania≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  or  hypomania≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was reported in Effexor XR treated patients in the premarketing studies in  MDD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ,  SAD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , and  PD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  (see  Table 2  ).  Mania≠B-NonOSE_AE / hypomania≠B-NonOSE_AE  has also been reported in a small proportion of patients with  mood≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorders≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  who were treated with other marketed drugs to treat  MDD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate . Effexor XR should be used cautiously in patients with a history of  mania≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or  hypomania≠B-Not_AE_Candidate .

            5.7 Discontinuation Syndrome
 

   Discontinuation≠B-NonOSE_AE   symptoms≠I-NonOSE_AE  have been systematically evaluated in patients taking venlafaxine, including prospective analyses of clinical studies in  GAD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and retrospective surveys of studies in  MDD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and  SAD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate .

Reported symptoms include  agitation≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  anorexia≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  anxiety≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  confusion≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  impaired≠B-NonOSE_AE  coordination and  balance≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  diarrhea≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  dizziness≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  dry≠B-NonOSE_AE   mouth≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  dysphoric≠B-NonOSE_AE   mood≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  fasciculation≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  fatigue≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  flu≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  like≠I-NonOSE_AE   symptoms≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  headaches≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  hypomania≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  insomnia≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  nausea≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  nervousness≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  nightmares≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  sensory≠B-NonOSE_AE   disturbances≠I-NonOSE_AE  (including  shock≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  like≠I-NonOSE_AE   electrical≠I-NonOSE_AE   sensations≠I-NonOSE_AE ),  somnolence≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  sweating≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  tremor≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  vertigo≠B-NonOSE_AE , and  vomiting≠B-NonOSE_AE .

 During marketing of Effexor XR, other SNRIs, and SSRIs, there have been spontaneous reports of  adverse≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   events≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   occurring≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   upon≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   discontinuation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including the following:  dysphoric≠B-NonOSE_AE   mood≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  irritability≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  agitation≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  dizziness≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  sensory≠B-NonOSE_AE   disturbances≠I-NonOSE_AE  (e.g.,  paresthesia≠B-NonOSE_AE , such as  electric≠B-NonOSE_AE   shock≠I-NonOSE_AE   sensations≠I-NonOSE_AE ),  anxiety≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  confusion≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  headache≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  lethargy≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  emotional≠B-NonOSE_AE   lability≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  insomnia≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  hypomania≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  tinnitus≠B-NonOSE_AE , and  seizures≠B-NonOSE_AE . While these events are generally self-limiting, there have been reports of serious  discontinuation≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   symptoms≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE .

 Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with Effexor XR. A gradual reduction in the dose, rather than abrupt cessation, is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable  symptoms≠B-NonOSE_AE   occur≠I-NonOSE_AE   following≠I-NonOSE_AE   a≠I-NonOSE_AE   decrease≠I-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   the≠I-NonOSE_AE   dose≠I-NonOSE_AE   or≠I-NonOSE_AE   upon≠I-NonOSE_AE   discontinuation≠I-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   treatment≠I-NonOSE_AE , then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose, but at a more gradual rate [ see  Dosage and Administration (2.8)    ].

    5.8 Seizures

   Seizures≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  have occurred with venlafaxine therapy. Effexor XR, like many antidepressants, should be used cautiously in patients with a history of  seizures≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and should be discontinued in any patient who develops  seizures≠B-NonOSE_AE . [Must mitigate the risk: Risk factors, concomitant meds that  lower≠B-NonOSE_AE   the≠I-NonOSE_AE   seizure≠I-NonOSE_AE   threshold≠I-NonOSE_AE .]

    5.9 Hyponatremia

   Hyponatremia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  can occur as a result of treatment with SSRIs and SNRIs, including Effexor XR. In many cases, the  hyponatremia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  appears to be the result of the  Syndrome≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   Inappropriate≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   Antidiuretic≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   Hormone≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  SIADH≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ) secretion. Cases with  serum≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   sodium≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   lower≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   than≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   1≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  1≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  0≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   mmol≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  /≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  L≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported. Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing  hyponatremia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  with SSRIs and SNRIs [ see  Use in Specific Populations (8.5)    ]. Also, patients taking diuretics, or those who are otherwise volume-depleted, may be at greater risk. Consider discontinuation of Effexor XR in patients with symptomatic  hyponatremia≠B-NonOSE_AE , and institute appropriate medical intervention.

 Signs and symptoms of  hyponatremia≠B-NonOSE_AE  include  headache≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  difficulty≠B-NonOSE_AE   concentrating≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  memory≠B-NonOSE_AE   impairment≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  confusion≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  weakness≠B-NonOSE_AE , and  unsteadiness≠B-NonOSE_AE , which may lead to  falls≠B-NonOSE_AE . Signs and symptoms associated with more severe and/or acute cases have included  hallucination≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  syncope≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  seizure≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  coma≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  respiratory≠B-NonOSE_AE   arrest≠I-NonOSE_AE , and  death≠B-NonOSE_AE .

 The risks associated with longer term Effexor XR use were assessed in an open-label  MDD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  study of children and adolescents who received Effexor XR for up to six months. The children and adolescents in the study had  increases≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   weight≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   that≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   were≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   less≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   than≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   expected≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , based on data from age- and sex-matched peers.

    Height Changes  

 Table 5 shows the average  height≠B-NonOSE_AE   increase≠I-NonOSE_AE  in pediatric patients in the short-term, placebo-controlled  MDD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ,  GAD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , and  SAD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  studies. The differences in height increases in  GAD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and  MDD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  studies were most notable in patients younger than twelve.

   Interstitial≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   lung≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   disease≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  eosinophilic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pneumonia≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  associated with venlafaxine therapy have been rarely reported. The possibility of these adverse events should be considered in venlafaxine-treated patients who present with progressive  dyspnea≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  cough≠B-NonOSE_AE  or  chest≠B-NonOSE_AE   discomfort≠I-NonOSE_AE . Such patients should undergo a prompt medical evaluation, and discontinuation of venlafaxine therapy should be considered.
