  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

     Adverse Reactions in Adults  

 The data described herein reflect exposure to REMICADE in 4779 adult patients (1304 patients with  rheumatoid≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   arthritis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , 1106 patients with  Crohn≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  s≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , 202 with  ankylosing≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   spondylitis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , 293 with  psoriatic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   arthritis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , 484 with  ulcerative≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   colitis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , 1373 with  plaque≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   psoriasis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , and 17 patients with other conditions), including 2625 patients exposed beyond 30 weeks and 374 exposed beyond 1 year.  [For information on adverse reactions in pediatric patients see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  .]  One of the most-common reasons for discontinuation of treatment was  infusion≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  related≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (e.g.,  dyspnea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  flushing≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  headache≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  rash≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ).

     Infusion-related Reactions  

 An infusion reaction was defined in clinical trials as any adverse event occurring during an infusion or within 1 hour after an infusion. In Phase 3 clinical studies, 18% of REMICADE-treated patients experienced an  infusion≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reaction≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  compared to 5% of placebo-treated patients. Of infliximab-treated patients who had an  infusion≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reaction≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  during the induction period, 27% experienced an  infusion≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reaction≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  during the maintenance period. Of patients who did not have an infusion reaction during the induction period, 9% experienced an  infusion≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reaction≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  during the maintenance period.

 Among all REMICADE infusions, 3% were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as  fever≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  or  chills≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , 1% were accompanied by  cardiopulmonary≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (primarily  chest≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  hypotension≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  hypertension≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  or  dyspnea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ), and <1% were accompanied by  pruritus≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  urticaria≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , or the combined symptoms of  pruritus≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE / urticaria≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  cardiopulmonary≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . Serious  infusion≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred in <1% of patients and included  anaphylaxis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  convulsions≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  erythematous≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   rash≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  hypotension≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . Approximately 3% of patients discontinued REMICADE because of  infusion≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and all patients recovered with treatment and/or discontinuation of the infusion. REMICADE infusions beyond the initial infusion were not associated with a higher incidence of reactions. The  infusion≠B-NonOSE_AE   reaction≠I-NonOSE_AE  rates remained stable in  psoriasis≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  through 1 year in  psoriasis≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  Study I. In  psoriasis≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  Study II, the rates were variable over time and somewhat higher following the final infusion than after the initial infusion. Across the 3  psoriasis≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  studies, the percent of total infusions resulting in  infusion≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (i.e., an adverse event occurring within 1 hour) was 7% in the 3 mg/kg group, 4% in the 5 mg/kg group, and 1% in the placebo group.

 Patients who became  positive≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   for≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   antibodies≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   to≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infliximab≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  were more likely (approximately two-to three-fold) to have an  infusion≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reaction≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  than were those who were negative. Use of concomitant  immunosuppressant≠B-NonOSE_AE   agents≠I-NonOSE_AE  appeared to reduce the frequency of both  antibodies≠B-NonOSE_AE   to≠I-NonOSE_AE   infliximab≠I-NonOSE_AE  and  infusion≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE   [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  and  Drug Interactions (7.4)  ]  .

     Infusion Reactions Following Re-administration  

 In a clinical trial of patients with moderate to severe  psoriasis≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  designed to assess the efficacy of long-term maintenance therapy versus re-treatment with an induction regimen of REMICADE following disease flare, 4% (8/219) of patients in the re-treatment therapy arm experienced serious  infusion≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  versus <1% (1/222) in the maintenance therapy arm. Patients enrolled in this trial did not receive any concomitant  immunosuppressant≠B-NonOSE_AE   therapy≠I-NonOSE_AE . In this study, the majority of serious  infusion≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred during the second infusion at Week 2. Symptoms included, but were not limited to,  dyspnea≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  urticaria≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  facial≠B-NonOSE_AE   edema≠I-NonOSE_AE , and  hypotension≠B-NonOSE_AE . In all cases, REMICADE treatment was discontinued and/or other treatment instituted with complete resolution of signs and symptoms.

     Delayed Reactions/Reactions Following Re-administration  

 In  psoriasis≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  studies, approximately 1% of REMICADE-treated patients experienced a possible  delayed≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   hypersensitivity≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   reaction≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , generally reported as  serum≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   sickness≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  or a combination of  arthralgia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and/or  myalgia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  with  fever≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and/or  rash≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . These reactions generally occurred within 2 weeks after repeat infusion.

     Infections  

 In REMICADE clinical studies, treated  infections≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  were reported in 36% of REMICADE-treated patients (average of 51 weeks of follow-up) and in 25% of placebo-treated patients (average of 37 weeks of follow-up). The  infections≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  most frequently reported were  respiratory≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   tract≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infections≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (including  sinusitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  pharyngitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  bronchitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ) and  urinary≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   tract≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infections≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . Among REMICADE-treated patients, serious  infections≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  included  pneumonia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  cellulitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  abscess≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  skin≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   ulceration≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  sepsis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  bacterial≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   infection≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . In clinical trials, 7  opportunistic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   infections≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  were reported; 2 cases each of  coccidioidomycosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (1 case was  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE ) and  histoplasmosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (1 case was  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE ), and 1 case each of  pneumocystosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  nocardiosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  cytomegalovirus≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .  Tuberculosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was reported in 14 patients, 4 of whom  died≠B-NonOSE_AE  due to  miliary≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   tuberculosis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . Other cases of  tuberculosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , including  disseminated≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   tuberculosis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , also have been reported post-marketing. Most of these cases of  tuberculosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred within the first 2 months after initiation of therapy with REMICADE and may reflect  recrudescence≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   latent≠I-NonOSE_AE   disease≠I-NonOSE_AE   [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  . In the 1-year placebo-controlled studies  RA≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  I and  RA≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  II, 5.3% of patients receiving REMICADE every 8 weeks with MTX developed serious  infections≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  as compared to 3.4% of placebo patients receiving MTX. Of 924 patients receiving REMICADE, 1.7% developed  pneumonia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and 0.4% developed  TB≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , when compared to 0.3% and 0.0% in the placebo arm respectively. In a shorter (22-week) placebo-controlled study of 1082  RA≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  patients randomized to receive placebo, 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg REMICADE infusions at 0, 2, and 6 weeks, followed by every 8 weeks with MTX, serious  infections≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  were more frequent in the 10 mg/kg REMICADE group (5.3%) than the 3 mg/kg or placebo groups (1.7% in both). During the 54-week  Crohn≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  s≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  II Study, 15% of patients with  fistulizing≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   Crohn≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  s≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  developed a new  fistula≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  related≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   abscess≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE .

 In REMICADE clinical studies in patients with  ulcerative≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   colitis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  infections≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  treated with antimicrobials were reported in 27% of REMICADE-treated patients (average of 41 weeks of follow-up) and in 18% of placebo-treated patients (average 32 weeks of follow-up). The types of  infections≠B-NonOSE_AE , including serious  infections≠B-NonOSE_AE , reported in patients with  ulcerative≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   colitis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  were similar to those reported in other clinical studies.

 The onset of serious  infections≠B-NonOSE_AE  may be preceded by constitutional symptoms such as  fever≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  chills≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  weight≠B-NonOSE_AE   loss≠I-NonOSE_AE , and  fatigue≠B-NonOSE_AE . The majority of serious  infections≠B-NonOSE_AE , however, may also be preceded by signs or symptoms localized to the site of the  infection≠B-NonOSE_AE .

     Autoantibodies/Lupus-like Syndrome  

 Approximately half of REMICADE-treated patients in clinical trials who were  antinuclear≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   antibody≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   (≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  ANA≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  )≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   negative≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  at baseline developed a  positive≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   ANA≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  during the trial compared with approximately one-fifth of placebo-treated patients.  Anti≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  dsDNA≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   antibodies≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  were newly detected in approximately one-fifth of REMICADE-treated patients compared with 0% of placebo-treated patients. Reports of  lupus≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  lupus≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  like≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   syndromes≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , however, remain uncommon.

     Malignancies  

 In controlled trials, more REMICADE-treated patients developed  malignancies≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  than placebo-treated patients  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]  .

 In a randomized controlled clinical trial exploring the use of REMICADE in patients with moderate to severe  COPD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  who were either current smokers or ex-smokers, 157 patients were treated with REMICADE at doses similar to those used in  rheumatoid≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   arthritis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and  Crohn≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  s≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Of these REMICADE-treated patients, 9 developed a  malignancy≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , including 1  lymphoma≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , for a rate of 7.67 cases per 100 patient-years of follow-up (median duration of follow-up 0.8 years; 95% CI 3.51 - 14.56). There was 1 reported  malignancy≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  among 77 control patients for a rate of 1.63 cases per 100 patient-years of follow-up (median duration of follow-up 0.8 years; 95% CI 0.04 - 9.10). The majority of the  malignancies≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   developed≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   the≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   lung≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  or head and neck.

     Patients with Heart Failure  

 In a randomized study evaluating REMICADE in moderate to severe  heart≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   failure≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   (≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  NYHA≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   Class≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   III≠I-Not_AE_Candidate /IV;  left≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   ventricular≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   ejection≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   fraction≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   <≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  =≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  3≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  5≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  %≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ), 150 patients were randomized to receive treatment with 3 infusions of REMICADE 10 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, or placebo, at 0, 2, and 6 weeks. Higher incidences of  mortality≠B-NonOSE_AE  and hospitalization due to  worsening≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   heart≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   failure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  were observed in patients receiving the 10 mg/kg REMICADE dose. At 1 year, 8 patients in the 10 mg/kg REMICADE group had  died≠B-NonOSE_AE  compared with 4  deaths≠B-NonOSE_AE  each in the 5 mg/kg REMICADE and the placebo groups. There were trends toward increased  dyspnea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  hypotension≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  angina≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  dizziness≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  in both the 10 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg REMICADE treatment groups, versus placebo. REMICADE has not been studied in patients with mild  heart≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   failure≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   (≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  NYHA≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   Class≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   I≠I-Not_AE_Candidate /II)  [see  Contraindications (4)  and  Warnings and Precautions (5.5)  ]  .

     Immunogenicity  

 Treatment with REMICADE can be associated with the development of  antibodies≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   to≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infliximab≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . An enzyme immunoassay (EIA) method was originally used to measure  anti≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  infliximab≠I-NonOSE_AE   antibodies≠I-NonOSE_AE  in clinical studies of REMICADE. The EIA method is subject to interference by serum infliximab, possibly resulting in an underestimation of the rate of patient  antibody≠B-NonOSE_AE   formation≠I-NonOSE_AE . A separate, drug-tolerant electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) method for detecting  antibodies≠B-NonOSE_AE   to≠I-NonOSE_AE   infliximab≠I-NonOSE_AE  was subsequently developed and validated. This method is 60-fold more sensitive than the original EIA. With the ECLIA method, all clinical samples can be classified as either positive or negative for  antibodies≠B-NonOSE_AE   to≠I-NonOSE_AE   infliximab≠I-NonOSE_AE  without the need for the inconclusive category.

 The incidence of  antibodies≠B-NonOSE_AE   to≠I-NonOSE_AE   infliximab≠I-NonOSE_AE  was based on the original EIA method in all clinical studies of REMICADE except for the Phase 3 study in pediatric patients with  ulcerative≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   colitis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  where the incidence of  antibodies≠B-NonOSE_AE   to≠I-NonOSE_AE   infliximab≠I-NonOSE_AE  was detected using both the EIA and ECLIA methods  [see  Adverse Reactions, Pediatric  Ulcerative≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   Colitis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  (6.1)  ]  .

 The incidence of  antibodies≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   to≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infliximab≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  in patients given a 3-dose induction regimen followed by maintenance dosing was approximately 10% as assessed through 1 to 2 years of REMICADE treatment. A higher incidence of  antibodies≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   to≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infliximab≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  was observed in  Crohn≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  s≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  patients receiving REMICADE after drug-free intervals >16 weeks. In a study of  psoriatic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   arthritis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  in which 191 patients received 5 mg/kg with or without MTX,  antibodies≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   to≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infliximab≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred in 15% of patients. The majority of  antibody≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  positive≠I-NonOSE_AE  patients had low titers. Patients who were  antibody≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  positive≠I-NonOSE_AE  were more likely to have higher rates of clearance, reduced efficacy and to experience an  infusion≠B-NonOSE_AE   reaction≠I-NonOSE_AE   [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  than were patients who were  antibody≠B-NonOSE_AE   negative≠I-NonOSE_AE .  Antibody≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  development was lower among  rheumatoid≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   arthritis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and  Crohn≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  s≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  patients receiving  immunosuppressant≠B-NonOSE_AE   therapies≠I-NonOSE_AE  such as 6-MP/AZA or MTX.

 In the  psoriasis≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  Study II, which included both the 5 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg doses,  antibodies≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  were observed in 36% of patients treated with 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks for 1 year, and in 51% of patients treated with 3 mg/kg every 8 weeks for 1 year. In the  psoriasis≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  Study III, which also included both the 5 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg doses,  antibodies≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  were observed in 20% of patients treated with 5 mg/kg induction (weeks 0, 2 and 6), and in 27% of patients treated with 3 mg/kg induction. Despite the  increase≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   antibody≠I-NonOSE_AE  formation, the  infusion≠B-NonOSE_AE   reaction≠I-NonOSE_AE   rates≠I-NonOSE_AE  in Studies I and II in patients treated with 5 mg/kg induction followed by every 8 week maintenance for 1 year and in Study III in patients treated with 5 mg/kg induction (14.1%-23.0%) and serious  infusion≠B-NonOSE_AE   reaction≠I-NonOSE_AE  rates (<1%) were similar to those observed in other study populations. The clinical significance of apparent increased  immunogenicity≠B-NonOSE_AE  on efficacy and  infusion≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE  in  psoriasis≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  patients as compared to patients with other diseases treated with REMICADE over the long term is not known.

 The data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were  positive≠B-NonOSE_AE   for≠I-NonOSE_AE   antibodies≠I-NonOSE_AE   to≠I-NonOSE_AE   infliximab≠I-NonOSE_AE  in an immunoassay, and they are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of  antibody≠B-NonOSE_AE   positivity≠I-NonOSE_AE  in an assay may be influenced by several factors including sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medication, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of  antibodies≠B-NonOSE_AE   to≠I-NonOSE_AE   infliximab≠I-NonOSE_AE  with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.

      Hepatotoxicity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   

 Severe  liver≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   injury≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , including  acute≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   liver≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   failure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  autoimmune≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   hepatitis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , has been reported in patients receiving REMICADE  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.4)  ]  .  Reactivation≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   hepatitis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   B≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   virus≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  has occurred in patients receiving TNF-blocking agents, including REMICADE, who are chronic carriers of this virus  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  .

 In clinical trials in  rheumatoid≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   arthritis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  Crohn≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  s≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  ulcerative≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   colitis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  ankylosing≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   spondylitis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  plaque≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   psoriasis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , and  psoriatic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   arthritis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  elevations≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   aminotransferases≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  were observed (ALT more common than AST) in a greater proportion of patients receiving REMICADE than in controls (Table 1), both when REMICADE was given as monotherapy and when it was used in combination with other  immunosuppressive≠B-NonOSE_AE   agents≠I-NonOSE_AE . In general, patients who developed  ALT≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and AST  elevations≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  were asymptomatic, and the abnormalities decreased or resolved with either continuation or discontinuation of REMICADE, or modification of concomitant medications.

                 Adverse Reactions in Psoriasis Studies  
 

 During the placebo-controlled portion across the 3 clinical trials up to Week 16, the proportion of patients who experienced at least 1 serious adverse reaction (SAE; defined as resulting in  death≠B-NonOSE_AE , life threatening, requires hospitalization, or persistent or significant disability/incapacity) was 0.5% in the 3 mg/kg REMICADE group, 1.9% in the placebo group, and 1.6% in the 5 mg/kg REMICADE group.

 Among patients in the 2 Phase 3 studies, 12.4% of patients receiving REMICADE 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks through 1 year of maintenance treatment experienced at least 1 SAE in Study I. In Study II, 4.1% and 4.7% of patients receiving REMICADE 3 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks, respectively, through 1 year of maintenance treatment experienced at least 1 SAE.

 One  death≠B-NonOSE_AE  due to  bacterial≠B-NonOSE_AE   sepsis≠I-NonOSE_AE  occurred 25 days after the second infusion of 5 mg/kg REMICADE. Serious  infections≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  included  sepsis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  abscesses≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . In Study I, 2.7% of patients receiving REMICADE 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks through 1 year of maintenance treatment experienced at least 1 serious  infection≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . In Study II, 1.0% and 1.3% of patients receiving REMICADE 3 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg, respectively, through 1 year of treatment experienced at least 1 serious  infection≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . The most common serious  infection≠B-NonOSE_AE  (requiring hospitalization) was  abscess≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (skin, throat, and peri-rectal) reported by 5 (0.7%) patients in the 5 mg/kg REMICADE group. Two active cases of  tuberculosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  were reported: 6 weeks and 34 weeks after starting REMICADE.

 In the placebo-controlled portion of the  psoriasis≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  studies, 7 of 1123 patients who received REMICADE at any dose were diagnosed with at least one  NMSC≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  compared to 0 of 334 patients who received placebo.

 In the  psoriasis≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  studies, 1% (15/1373) of patients experienced  serum≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   sickness≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  or a combination of  arthralgia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and/or  myalgia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  with  fever≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and/or  rash≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , usually early in the treatment course. Of these patients, 6 required hospitalization due to  fever≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , severe  myalgia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  arthralgia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  swollen≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   joints≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  immobility≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .

     Other Adverse Reactions  

 Safety data are available from 4779 REMICADE-treated adult patients, including 1304 with  rheumatoid≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   arthritis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , 1106 with  Crohn≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  s≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , 484 with  ulcerative≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   colitis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , 202 with  ankylosing≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   spondylitis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , 293 with  psoriatic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   arthritis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , 1373 with  plaque≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   psoriasis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and 17 with other conditions. [For information on other adverse reactions in pediatric patients,  see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ]. Adverse reactions reported in >=5% of all patients with  rheumatoid≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   arthritis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  receiving 4 or more infusions are in Table 2. The types and frequencies of adverse reactions observed were similar in REMICADE-treated  rheumatoid≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   arthritis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  ankylosing≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   spondylitis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  psoriatic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   arthritis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  plaque≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   psoriasis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and  Crohn≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  s≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  patients except for  abdominal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , which occurred in 26% of REMICADE-treated patients with  Crohn≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  s≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . In the  Crohn≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  s≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  studies, there were insufficient numbers and duration of follow-up for patients who never received REMICADE to provide meaningful comparisons.

        Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients  
 

     Pediatric Crohn's Disease  

 There were some differences in the adverse reactions observed in the pediatric patients receiving REMICADE compared to those observed in adults with  Crohn≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  s≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . These differences are discussed in the following paragraphs.

 The following adverse reactions were reported more commonly in 103 randomized pediatric  Crohn≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  s≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  patients administered 5 mg/kg REMICADE through 54 weeks than in 385 adult  Crohn≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  s≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  patients receiving a similar treatment regimen:  anemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (11%),  leukopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (9%),  flushing≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (9%),  viral≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   infection≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (8%),  neutropenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (7%),  bone≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   fracture≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (7%),  bacterial≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   infection≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (6%), and  respiratory≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   tract≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   allergic≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   reaction≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (6%).

  Infections≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  were reported in 56% of randomized pediatric patients in Study Peds  Crohn≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  s≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and in 50% of adult patients in Study  Crohn≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  s≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  I. In Study Peds  Crohn≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  s≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  infections≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  were reported more frequently for patients who received every 8-week as opposed to every 12-week infusions (74% and 38%, respectively), while serious  infections≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  were reported for 3 patients in the every 8-week and 4 patients in the every 12-week maintenance treatment group. The most commonly reported  infections≠B-NonOSE_AE  were  upper≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   respiratory≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   tract≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infection≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  pharyngitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and the most commonly reported serious  infection≠B-NonOSE_AE  was  abscess≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .  Pneumonia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was reported for 3 patients, (2 in the every 8-week and 1 in the every 12-week maintenance treatment groups).  Herpes≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   zoster≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  was reported for 2 patients in the every 8-week maintenance treatment group.

 In Study Peds  Crohn≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  s≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , 18% of randomized patients experienced 1 or more  infusion≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE , with no notable difference between treatment groups. Of the 112 patients in Study Peds  Crohn≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  s≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , there were no serious  infusion≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE , and 2 patients had non-serious  anaphylactoid≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE .

 In Study Peds  Crohn≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  s≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , in which all patients received stable doses of 6-MP, AZA, or MTX, excluding inconclusive samples, 3 of 24 patients had  antibodies≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   to≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infliximab≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . Although 105 patients were tested for  antibodies≠B-NonOSE_AE   to≠I-NonOSE_AE   infliximab≠I-NonOSE_AE , 81 patients were classified as inconclusive because they could not be ruled as negative due to assay interference by the presence of infliximab in the sample.

  Elevations≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   ALT≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  up to 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were seen in 18% of pediatric patients in  Crohn≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  s≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  clinical trials; 4% had  ALT≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   elevations≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  >=3 * ULN, and 1% had elevations >=5 * ULN. (Median follow-up was 53 weeks.)

     Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis  

 Overall, the adverse reactions reported in the pediatric  ulcerative≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   colitis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  trial and adult  ulcerative≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   colitis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  (Study UC I and Study UC II) studies were generally consistent. In a pediatric UC trial, the most common adverse reactions were  upper≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   respiratory≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   tract≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infection≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  pharyngitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  abdominal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  fever≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  headache≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .

  Infections≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  were reported in 31 (52%) of 60 treated patients in the pediatric  UC≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  trial and 22 (37%) required oral or parenteral antimicrobial treatment. The proportion of patients with  infections≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  in the pediatric  UC≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  trial was similar to that in the pediatric  Crohn≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  s≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  study (Study Peds  Crohn≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  s≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ) but higher than the proportion in the adults'  ulcerative≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   colitis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  studies (Study  UC≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  I and Study  UC≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  II). The overall incidence of  infections≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  in the pediatric  UC≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  trial was 13/22 (59%) in the every 8 week maintenance treatment group.  Upper≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   respiratory≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   tract≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infection≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (7/60 [12%]) and  pharyngitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (5/60 [8%]) were the most frequently reported  respiratory≠B-NonOSE_AE   system≠I-NonOSE_AE   infections≠I-NonOSE_AE . Serious  infections≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  were reported in 12% (7/60) of all treated patients.

 In the pediatric  UC≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  trial, 58 patients were evaluated for  antibodies≠B-NonOSE_AE   to≠I-NonOSE_AE   infliximab≠I-NonOSE_AE  using the EIA as well as the drug-tolerant ECLIA. With the EIA, 4 of 58 (7%) patients had  antibodies≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   to≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infliximab≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . With the ECLIA, 30 of 58 (52%) patients had  antibodies≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   to≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infliximab≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   [see  Adverse Reactions,  Immunogenicity≠B-NonOSE_AE  (6.1)  ]  . The higher incidence of  antibodies≠B-NonOSE_AE   to≠I-NonOSE_AE   infliximab≠I-NonOSE_AE  by the ECLIA method was due to the 60-fold higher sensitivity compared to the EIA method. While EIA-positive patients generally had undetectable trough infliximab concentrations, ECLIA-positive patients could have detectable trough concentrations of infliximab because the ECLIA assay is more sensitive and drug-tolerant.

  Elevations≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   ALT≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  up to 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were seen in 17% (10/60) of pediatric patients in the pediatric  UC≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  trial; 7% (4/60) had  ALT≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   elevations≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  >=3 * ULN, and 2% (1/60) had elevations >=5 * ULN (median follow-up was 49 weeks).

 Overall, 8 of 60 (13%) treated patients experienced one or more  infusion≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , including 4 of 22 (18%) patients in the every 8-week treatment maintenance group. No serious  infusion≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE  were reported.

 In the pediatric  UC≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  trial, 45 patients were in the 12 to 17 year age group and 15 in the 6 to 11 year age group. The numbers of patients in each subgroup are too small to make any definitive conclusions about the effect of age on safety events. There were higher proportions of patients with serious adverse events (40% vs. 18%) and discontinuation due to adverse events (40% vs. 16%) in the younger age group than in the older age group. While the proportion of patients with  infections≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was also higher in the younger age group (60% vs. 49%), for serious  infections≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , the proportions were similar in the two age groups (13% in the 6 to 11 year age group vs. 11% in the 12 to 17 year age group). Overall proportions of adverse reactions, including  infusion≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , were similar between the 6 to 11 and 12 to 17 year age groups (13%).

   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  Adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of REMICADE in adult and pediatric patients. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

 The following adverse reactions, some with  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE  outcome, have been reported during post-approval use of REMICADE:  neutropenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.6)  ]  ,  agranulocytosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (including infants exposed  in utero  to infliximab),  interstitial≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   lung≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   disease≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (including  pulmonary≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   fibrosis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE / interstitial≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pneumonitis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and rapidly progressive disease),  idiopathic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   thrombocytopenic≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   purpura≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  thrombotic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   thrombocytopenic≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   purpura≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  pericardial≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   effusion≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  systemic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and cutaneous  vasculitis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  erythema≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   multiforme≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  Stevens≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  Johnson≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   Syndrome≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  toxic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   epidermal≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   necrolysis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  peripheral≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   demyelinating≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   disorders≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (such as  Guillain≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  Barre≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   syndrome≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  chronic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   inflammatory≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   demyelinating≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   polyneuropathy≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  multifocal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   motor≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   neuropathy≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ), new onset and  worsening≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   psoriasis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (all subtypes including pustular, primarily palmoplantar),  transverse≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   myelitis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  neuropathies≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (additional  neurologic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  have also been observed)  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.9)  ]  ,  acute≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   liver≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   failure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  jaundice≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  hepatitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  cholestasis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.4)  ]  , serious  infections≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  ,  malignancies≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , including  melanoma≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  Merkel≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   cell≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   carcinoma≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  cervical≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   cancer≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]  and  vaccine≠B-NonOSE_AE   breakthrough≠I-NonOSE_AE   infection≠I-NonOSE_AE  including  bovine≠B-NonOSE_AE   tuberculosis≠I-NonOSE_AE  ( disseminated≠B-NonOSE_AE   BCG≠I-NonOSE_AE   infection≠I-NonOSE_AE ) following vaccination in an  infant≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   exposed≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE    in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   utero≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE    to≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infliximab≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.15)  ]  .
