  6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

 Three randomized clinical trials enrolled patients with  metastatic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   prostate≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  that has progressed on androgen deprivation therapy (GnRH therapy or bilateral orchiectomy), a disease setting that is also defined as  metastatic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   CRPC≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Two trials were placebo-controlled (Studies 1 and 2), and one trial was bicalutamide-controlled (Study 3). In Studies 1 and 2, patients received XTANDI 160 mg or placebo orally once daily. In Study 3, patients received XTANDI 160 mg or bicalutamide 50 mg orally once daily. All patients continued androgen deprivation therapy. Patients were allowed, but not required, to take glucocorticoids.

 The most common adverse reactions (>= 10%) that occurred more commonly (>= 2% over placebo) in the XTANDI-treated patients from the two randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials were  asthenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE / fatigue≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  back≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  decreased≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   appetite≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  constipation≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  arthralgia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  diarrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  hot≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   flush≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  upper≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   respiratory≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   tract≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infection≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  peripheral≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   edema≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  dyspnea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  musculoskeletal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  weight≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   decreased≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  headache≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  hypertension≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  dizziness≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE / vertigo≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .

   Study 1: XTANDI versus Placebo in Metastatic CRPC Following Chemotherapy  

 Study 1 enrolled 1199 patients with  metastatic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   CRPC≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  who had previously received docetaxel. The median duration of treatment was 8.3 months with XTANDI and 3.0 months with placebo. During the trial, 48% of patients on the XTANDI arm and 46% of patients on the placebo arm received glucocorticoids.

 Grade 3 and higher adverse reactions were reported among 47% of XTANDI-treated patients and 53% of placebo-treated patients. Discontinuations due to adverse events were reported for 16% of XTANDI-treated patients and 18% of placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reaction leading to treatment discontinuation was  seizure≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , which occurred in 0.9% of the XTANDI-treated patients compared to none (0%) of the placebo-treated patients.  Table 1  shows adverse reactions reported in Study 1 that occurred at a >= 2% higher frequency in the XTANDI arm compared to the placebo arm.

             Study 2: XTANDI versus Placebo in Chemotherapy-naive Metastatic CRPC  
 

 Study 2 enrolled 1717 patients with  metastatic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   CRPC≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  who had not received prior  cytotoxic≠B-NonOSE_AE   chemotherapy≠I-NonOSE_AE , of whom 1715 received at least one dose of study drug. The median duration of treatment was 17.5 months with XTANDI and 4.6 months with placebo. Grade 3-4 adverse reactions were reported in 44% of XTANDI-treated patients and 37% of placebo-treated patients. Discontinuations due to adverse events were reported for 6% of XTANDI-treated patients and 6% of placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reaction leading to treatment discontinuation was  fatigue≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE / asthenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , which occurred in 1% of patients on each treatment arm.  Table 2  includes adverse reactions reported in Study 2 that occurred at a >= 2% higher frequency in the XTANDI arm compared to the placebo arm.

             Study 3: XTANDI versus Bicalutamide in Chemotherapy-naive Metastatic CRPC  
 

 Study 3 enrolled 375 patients with  metastatic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   CRPC≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  who had not received prior  cytotoxic≠B-NonOSE_AE   chemotherapy≠I-NonOSE_AE , of whom 372 received at least one dose of study drug.  The median duration of treatment was 11.6 months with XTANDI and 5.8 months with bicalutamide. Discontinuations with an adverse event as the primary reason were reported for 7.6% of XTANDI-treated patients and 6.3% of bicalutamide-treated patients. The most common adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation were  back≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  pathological≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   fracture≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , which occurred in 3.8% of XTANDI-treated patients for each event and in 2.1% and 1.6% of bicalutamide-treated patients, respectively.  Table 3  shows overall and common adverse reactions (>= 10%) in XTANDI-treated patients.

             Laboratory Abnormalities  
 

 In the two randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials, Grade 1-4  neutropenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred in 15% of patients treated with XTANDI (1% Grade 3-4) and in 6% of patients treated with placebo (0.5% Grade 3-4). The incidence of Grade 1-4  thrombocytopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was 6% of patients treated with XTANDI (0.3% Grade 3-4) and 5% of patients treated with placebo (0.5% Grade 3-4). Grade 1-4  elevations≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   ALT≠I-NonOSE_AE  occurred in 10% of patients treated with XTANDI (0.2% Grade 3-4) and 16% of patients treated with placebo (0.2% Grade 3-4). Grade 1-4  elevations≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   bilirubin≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred in 3% of patients treated with XTANDI (0.1% Grade 3-4) and 2% of patients treated with placebo (no Grade 3-4).

   Infections  

 In Study 1, 1% of patients treated with XTANDI compared to 0.3% of patients treated with placebo  died≠B-NonOSE_AE  from  infections≠B-NonOSE_AE  or  sepsis≠B-NonOSE_AE . In Study 2, 1 patient in each treatment group (0.1%) had an  infection≠B-NonOSE_AE  resulting in  death≠B-NonOSE_AE .

   Falls and Fall-related Injuries  

 In the two randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials,  falls≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  including  fall≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  related≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   injuries≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , occurred in 9% of patients treated with XTANDI compared to 4% of patients treated with placebo.  Falls≠B-NonOSE_AE  were not associated with  loss≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   consciousness≠I-NonOSE_AE  or  seizure≠B-NonOSE_AE .  Fall≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  related≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   injuries≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  were more severe in patients treated with XTANDI and included non-pathologic fractures, joint injuries, and hematomas.

   Hypertension  

 In the two randomized placebo-controlled trials,  hypertension≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was reported in 11% of patients receiving XTANDI and 4% of patients receiving placebo. No patients experienced  hypertensive≠B-NonOSE_AE   crisis≠I-NonOSE_AE . Medical history of  hypertension≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  was balanced between arms.  Hypertension≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  led to study discontinuation in < 1% of patients in each arm.

   6.2 Post-Marketing Experience

  The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of XTANDI. Because these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
