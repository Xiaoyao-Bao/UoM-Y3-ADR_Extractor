   PRECAUTIONS

   General:

    Activation of Mania/Hypomania:  

  During premarketing testing,  hypomania≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  or  mania≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred in approximately 1.0% of  unipolar≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  patients treated with PAXIL compared to 1.1% of active-control and 0.3% of placebo-treated  unipolar≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  patients. In a subset of patients classified as  bipolar≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , the rate of  manic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  episodes was 2.2% for PAXIL and 11.6% for the combined active-control groups. As with all drugs effective in the treatment of  major≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depressive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , PAXIL should be used cautiously in patients with a history of  mania≠B-Not_AE_Candidate .

     Seizures:  

  During premarketing testing,  seizures≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred in 0.1% of patients treated with PAXIL, a rate similar to that associated with other drugs effective in the treatment of  major≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depressive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . PAXIL should be used cautiously in patients with a history of  seizures≠B-Not_AE_Candidate . It should be discontinued in any patient who develops  seizures≠B-NonOSE_AE .

     Discontinuation of Treatment With PAXIL:  

  Recent clinical trials supporting the various approved indications for PAXIL employed a taper-phase regimen, rather than an abrupt discontinuation of treatment. The taper-phase regimen used in  GAD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and  PTSD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  clinical trials involved an incremental decrease in the daily dose by 10 mg/day at weekly intervals. When a daily dose of 20 mg/day was reached, patients were continued on this dose for 1 week before treatment was stopped.

 With this regimen in those studies, the following adverse events were reported at an incidence of 2% or greater for PAXIL and were at least twice that reported for placebo:  Abnormal≠B-NonOSE_AE   dreams≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  paresthesia≠B-NonOSE_AE , and  dizziness≠B-NonOSE_AE . In the majority of patients, these events were mild to moderate and were self-limiting and did not require medical intervention.

 During marketing of PAXIL and other SSRIs and SNRIs, there have been spontaneous reports of  adverse≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   events≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   occurring≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   upon≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   the≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   discontinuation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  of these drugs (particularly when abrupt), including the following:  Dysphoric≠B-NonOSE_AE   mood≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  irritability≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  agitation≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  dizziness≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  sensory≠B-NonOSE_AE   disturbances≠I-NonOSE_AE  (e.g.,  paresthesias≠B-NonOSE_AE  such as  electric≠B-NonOSE_AE   shock≠I-NonOSE_AE   sensations≠I-NonOSE_AE  and  tinnitus≠B-NonOSE_AE ),  anxiety≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  confusion≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  headache≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  lethargy≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  emotional≠B-NonOSE_AE   lability≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  insomnia≠B-NonOSE_AE , and  hypomania≠B-NonOSE_AE . While these events are generally self-limiting, there have been reports of serious  discontinuation≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   symptoms≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE .

 Patients should be monitored for these  symptoms≠B-NonOSE_AE   when≠I-NonOSE_AE   discontinuing≠I-NonOSE_AE   treatment≠I-NonOSE_AE  with PAXIL. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate (see  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  ).

 See also  PRECAUTIONS  :  Pediatric Use  , for adverse events reported upon discontinuation of treatment with PAXIL in pediatric patients.

     Tamoxifen:  

  Some studies have shown that the efficacy of tamoxifen, as measured by the risk of  breast≠B-NonOSE_AE   cancer≠I-NonOSE_AE  relapse/ mortality≠B-NonOSE_AE , may be reduced when co-prescribed with paroxetine as a result of paroxetine's irreversible inhibition of CYP2D6 (see Drug Interactions). However, other studies have failed to demonstrate such a risk. It is uncertain whether the coadministration of paroxetine and tamoxifen has a significant adverse effect on the efficacy of tamoxifen. One study suggests that the risk may increase with longer duration of coadministration. When tamoxifen is used for the treatment or prevention of  breast≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , prescribers should consider using an alternative antidepressant with little or no CYP2D6 inhibition.

     Akathisia:  

  The use of paroxetine or other SSRIs has been associated with the development of  akathisia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , which is characterized by an inner sense of  restlessness≠B-NonOSE_AE  and  psychomotor≠B-NonOSE_AE   agitation≠I-NonOSE_AE  such as an  inability≠B-NonOSE_AE   to≠I-NonOSE_AE   sit≠I-NonOSE_AE   or≠I-NonOSE_AE   stand≠I-NonOSE_AE   still≠I-NonOSE_AE  usually associated with subjective  distress≠B-NonOSE_AE . This is most likely to occur within the first few weeks of treatment.

     Hyponatremia:  

   Hyponatremia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  may occur as a result of treatment with SSRIs and SNRIs, including PAXIL. In many cases, this  hyponatremia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  appears to be the result of the  syndrome≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   inappropriate≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   antidiuretic≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   hormone≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   secretion≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  SIADH≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ). Cases with  serum≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   sodium≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   lower≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   than≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   1≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  1≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  0≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   mmol≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  /≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  L≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported. Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing  hyponatremia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  with SSRIs and SNRIs. Also, patients taking diuretics or who are otherwise  volume≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depleted≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  may be at greater risk (see  PRECAUTIONS  :  Geriatric Use  ). Discontinuation of PAXIL should be considered in patients with symptomatic  hyponatremia≠B-NonOSE_AE  and appropriate medical intervention should be instituted.

 Signs and symptoms of  hyponatremia≠B-NonOSE_AE  include  headache≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  difficulty≠B-NonOSE_AE   concentrating≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  memory≠B-NonOSE_AE   impairment≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  confusion≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  weakness≠B-NonOSE_AE , and  unsteadiness≠B-NonOSE_AE , which may lead to  falls≠B-NonOSE_AE . Signs and symptoms associated with more severe and/or acute cases have included  hallucination≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  syncope≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  seizure≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  coma≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  respiratory≠B-NonOSE_AE   arrest≠I-NonOSE_AE , and  death≠B-NonOSE_AE .

     Abnormal Bleeding:  

  SSRIs and SNRIs, including paroxetine, may increase the risk of  bleeding≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of  gastrointestinal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   bleeding≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE .  Bleeding≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  events related to SSRIs and SNRIs use have ranged from  ecchymoses≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  hematomas≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  epistaxis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  petechiae≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  to life-threatening  hemorrhages≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . Patients should be cautioned about the risk of  bleeding≠B-NonOSE_AE  associated with the concomitant use of paroxetine and NSAIDs, aspirin, or other drugs that affect coagulation.

     Bone Fracture:  

  Epidemiological studies on  bone≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   fracture≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  risk following exposure to some antidepressants, including SSRIs, have reported an association between antidepressant treatment and  fractures≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . There are multiple possible causes for this observation and it is unknown to what extent  fracture≠B-NonOSE_AE  risk is directly attributable to SSRI treatment. The possibility of a  pathological≠B-NonOSE_AE   fracture≠I-NonOSE_AE , that is, a  fracture≠B-NonOSE_AE   produced≠I-NonOSE_AE   by≠I-NonOSE_AE   minimal≠I-NonOSE_AE   trauma≠I-NonOSE_AE  in a patient with  decreased≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   bone≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   mineral≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   density≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , should be considered in patients treated with paroxetine who present with unexplained  bone≠B-NonOSE_AE   pain≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  point≠B-NonOSE_AE   tenderness≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  swelling≠B-NonOSE_AE , or  bruising≠B-NonOSE_AE .

     Use in Patients With Concomitant Illness:  

  Clinical experience with PAXIL in patients with certain concomitant systemic illness is limited. Caution is advisable in using PAXIL in patients with diseases or conditions that could affect metabolism or hemodynamic responses.

 As with other SSRIs,  mydriasis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  has been infrequently reported in premarketing studies with PAXIL. A few cases of  acute≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   angle≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   closure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   glaucoma≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  associated with paroxetine therapy have been reported in the literature. As  mydriasis≠B-NonOSE_AE  can cause  acute≠B-NonOSE_AE   angle≠I-NonOSE_AE   closure≠I-NonOSE_AE  in patients with  narrow≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   angle≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   glaucoma≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , caution should be used when PAXIL is prescribed for patients with  narrow≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   angle≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   glaucoma≠I-Not_AE_Candidate .

 PAXIL has not been evaluated or used to any appreciable extent in patients with a recent history of  myocardial≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   infarction≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  or  unstable≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   heart≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Patients with these diagnoses were excluded from clinical studies during the product's premarket testing. Evaluation of electrocardiograms of 682 patients who received PAXIL in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, however, did not indicate that PAXIL is associated with the development of significant  ECG≠B-NonOSE_AE   abnormalities≠I-NonOSE_AE . Similarly, PAXIL does not cause any clinically important  changes≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   heart≠I-NonOSE_AE   rate≠I-NonOSE_AE  or blood pressure.

 Increased plasma concentrations of paroxetine occur in patients with severe  renal≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   impairment≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  ( creatinine≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   clearance≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   <≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  3≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  0≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   mL≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  /≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  min≠I-Not_AE_Candidate .) or severe  hepatic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   impairment≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . A lower starting dose should be used in such patients (see  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  ).

    Information for Patients:

  PAXIL should not be chewed or crushed, and should be swallowed whole.

 Patients should be cautioned about the risk of  serotonin≠B-NonOSE_AE   syndrome≠I-NonOSE_AE  with the concomitant use of PAXIL and triptans, tramadol, or other serotonergic agents.

 Patients should be advised that taking Paxil can cause mild  pupillary≠B-NonOSE_AE   dilation≠I-NonOSE_AE , which in susceptible individuals, can lead to an episode of  angle≠B-NonOSE_AE   closure≠I-NonOSE_AE   glaucoma≠I-NonOSE_AE . Pre-existing  glaucoma≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  is almost always  open≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  angle≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   glaucoma≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  because  angle≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   closure≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   glaucoma≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , when diagnosed, can be treated definitively with iridectomy.  Open≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  angle≠I-NonOSE_AE   glaucoma≠I-NonOSE_AE  is not a risk factor for  angle≠B-NonOSE_AE   closure≠I-NonOSE_AE   glaucoma≠I-NonOSE_AE . Patients may wish to be examined to determine whether they are susceptible to  angle≠B-NonOSE_AE   closure≠I-NonOSE_AE , and have a prophylactic procedure (e.g., iridectomy), if they are susceptible.

 Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with PAXIL and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide is available for PAXIL. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document.

 Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking PAXIL.

     Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk:  

  Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of  anxiety≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  agitation≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  panic≠B-NonOSE_AE   attacks≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  insomnia≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  irritability≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  hostility≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  aggressiveness≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  impulsivity≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  akathisia≠B-NonOSE_AE  ( psychomotor≠B-NonOSE_AE   restlessness≠I-NonOSE_AE ),  hypomania≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  mania≠B-NonOSE_AE , other  unusual≠B-NonOSE_AE   changes≠I-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   behavior≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  worsening≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   depression≠I-NonOSE_AE , and  suicidal≠B-NonOSE_AE   ideation≠I-NonOSE_AE , especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for  suicidal≠B-NonOSE_AE   thinking≠I-NonOSE_AE  and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication.

     Drugs That Interfere With Hemostasis (e.g., NSAIDs, Aspirin, and Warfarin):  

  Patients should be cautioned about the concomitant use of paroxetine and NSAIDs, aspirin, warfarin, or other drugs that affect coagulation since combined use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and these agents has been associated with an increased risk of  bleeding≠B-NonOSE_AE .

     Interference With Cognitive and Motor Performance:  

  Any psychoactive drug may  impair≠B-NonOSE_AE   judgment≠I-NonOSE_AE , thinking, or motor skills. Although in controlled studies PAXIL has not been shown to  impair≠B-NonOSE_AE   psychomotor≠I-NonOSE_AE   performance≠I-NonOSE_AE , patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that therapy with PAXIL does not affect their ability to engage in such activities.

     Completing Course of Therapy:  

  While patients may notice improvement with treatment with PAXIL in 1 to 4 weeks, they should be advised to continue therapy as directed.

      Concomitant Medication:    Patients should be advised to inform their physician if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter drugs, since there is a potential for interactions. Alcohol:  
 

  Although PAXIL has not been shown to increase the  impairment≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   mental≠I-NonOSE_AE  and motor  skills≠I-NonOSE_AE  caused by alcohol, patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking PAXIL.

     Pregnancy:  

  Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become  pregnant≠B-NonOSE_AE  or intend to become  pregnant≠B-NonOSE_AE  during therapy (see  WARNINGS  : Usage in  Pregnancy≠B-NonOSE_AE :  Teratogenic≠B-NonOSE_AE   Effects≠I-NonOSE_AE   and  Nonteratogenic≠B-NonOSE_AE   Effects≠I-NonOSE_AE   ).

     Nursing:  

  Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they are breastfeeding an infant (see  PRECAUTIONS  :  Nursing Mothers  ).

    Laboratory Tests:

  There are no specific laboratory tests recommended.

    Drug Interactions:

    Tryptophan:  

  As with other serotonin reuptake inhibitors, an interaction between paroxetine and tryptophan may occur when they are coadministered. Adverse experiences, consisting primarily of  headache≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  nausea≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  sweating≠B-NonOSE_AE , and  dizziness≠B-NonOSE_AE , have been reported when tryptophan was administered to patients taking PAXIL. Consequently, concomitant use of PAXIL with tryptophan is not recommended (see  WARNINGS  :  Serotonin Syndrome  ).

     Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors:  

  See  CONTRAINDICATIONS  and  WARNINGS  .

     Pimozide:  

  In a controlled study of healthy volunteers, after PAXIL was titrated to 60 mg daily, co-administration of a single dose of 2 mg pimozide was associated with mean increases in pimozide AUC of 151% and Cmaxof 62%, compared to pimozide administered alone. The increase in pimozide AUC and Cmaxis due to the CYP2D6 inhibitory properties of paroxetine. Due to the narrow therapeutic index of pimozide and its known ability to  prolong≠B-NonOSE_AE   the≠I-NonOSE_AE   QT≠I-NonOSE_AE   interval≠I-NonOSE_AE , concomitant use of pimozide and PAXIL is contraindicated (see  CONTRAINDICATIONS  ).

     Serotonergic Drugs:  

  Based on the mechanism of action of SNRIs and SSRIs, including paroxetine hydrochloride, and the potential for  serotonin≠B-NonOSE_AE   syndrome≠I-NonOSE_AE , caution is advised when PAXIL is coadministered with other drugs that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems, such as triptans, lithium, fentanyl, tramadol, amphetamines, or St. John's Wort (see  WARNINGS  :   Serotonin≠B-NonOSE_AE   Syndrome≠I-NonOSE_AE   ).

 The concomitant use of PAXIL with MAOIs (including linezolid and intravenous methylene blue) is contraindicated (see  CONTRAINDICATIONS  ). The concomitant use of PAXIL with other SSRIs, SNRIs or tryptophan is not recommended (see  PRECAUTIONS  :  Drug Interactions  : Tryptophan  ).

     Thioridazine:  

  See  CONTRAINDICATIONS  and  WARNINGS  .

     Warfarin:  

  Preliminary data suggest that there may be a pharmacodynamic interaction (that causes an  increased≠B-NonOSE_AE   bleeding≠I-NonOSE_AE  diathesis in the face of unaltered prothrombin time) between paroxetine and warfarin. Since there is little clinical experience, the concomitant administration of PAXIL and warfarin should be undertaken with caution (see  PRECAUTIONS  : Drugs That Interfere With Hemostasis  ).

     Triptans:  

  There have been rare postmarketing reports of  serotonin≠B-NonOSE_AE   syndrome≠I-NonOSE_AE  with the use of an SSRI and a triptan. If concomitant use of PAXIL with a triptan is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases (see  WARNINGS  :  Serotonin Syndrome  ).

     Drugs Affecting Hepatic Metabolism:  

  The metabolism and pharmacokinetics of paroxetine may be affected by the induction or inhibition of drug-metabolizing enzymes.

     Cimetidine:  

  Cimetidine inhibits many cytochrome P450(oxidative) enzymes. In a study where PAXIL (30 mg once daily) was dosed orally for 4 weeks, steady-state plasma concentrations of paroxetine were increased by approximately 50% during coadministration with oral cimetidine (300 mg three times daily) for the final week. Therefore, when these drugs are administered concurrently, dosage adjustment of PAXIL after the 20-mg starting dose should be guided by clinical effect. The effect of paroxetine on cimetidine's pharmacokinetics was not studied.

     Phenobarbital:  

  Phenobarbital induces many cytochrome P450(oxidative) enzymes. When a single oral 30-mg dose of PAXIL was administered at phenobarbital steady state (100 mg once daily for 14 days), paroxetine AUC and T1/2were reduced (by an average of 25% and 38%, respectively) compared to paroxetine administered alone. The effect of paroxetine on phenobarbital pharmacokinetics was not studied. Since PAXIL exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics, the results of this study may not address the case where the 2 drugs are both being chronically dosed. No initial dosage adjustment of PAXIL is considered necessary when coadministered with phenobarbital; any subsequent adjustment should be guided by clinical effect.

     Phenytoin:  

  When a single oral 30-mg dose of PAXIL was administered at phenytoin steady state (300 mg once daily for 14 days), paroxetine AUC and T1/2 were reduced (by an average of 50% and 35%, respectively) compared to PAXIL administered alone. In a separate study, when a single oral 300-mg dose of phenytoin was administered at paroxetine steady state (30 mg once daily for 14 days), phenytoin AUC was slightly reduced (12% on average) compared to phenytoin administered alone. Since both drugs exhibit nonlinear pharmacokinetics, the above studies may not address the case where the 2 drugs are both being chronically dosed. No initial dosage adjustments are considered necessary when these drugs are coadministered; any subsequent adjustments should be guided by clinical effect (see  ADVERSE REACTIONS  :  Postmarketing Reports  ).

     Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6:  

  Many drugs, including most drugs effective in the treatment of  major≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depressive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  (paroxetine, other SSRIs and many tricyclics), are metabolized by the cytochrome P450isozyme CYP2D6. Like other agents that are metabolized by CYP2D6, paroxetine may significantly inhibit the activity of this isozyme. In most patients (>90%), this CYP2D6 isozyme is saturated early during dosing with PAXIL. In 1 study, daily dosing of PAXIL (20 mg once daily) under steady-state conditions increased single dose desipramine (100 mg) Cmax, AUC, and T1/2 by an average of approximately 2-, 5-, and 3-fold, respectively. Concomitant use of paroxetine with risperidone, a CYP2D6 substrate has also been evaluated. In 1 study, daily dosing of paroxetine 20 mg in patients stabilized on risperidone (4 to 8 mg/day) increased mean plasma concentrations of risperidone approximately 4-fold, decreased 9-hydroxyrisperidone concentrations approximately 10%, and increased concentrations of the active moiety (the sum of risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone) approximately 1.4-fold. The effect of paroxetine on the pharmacokinetics of atomoxetine has been evaluated when both drugs were at steady state. In healthy volunteers who were extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6, paroxetine 20 mg daily was given in combination with 20 mg atomoxetine every 12 hours. This resulted in increases in steady state atomoxetine AUC values that were 6- to 8-fold greater and in atomoxetine Cmaxvalues that were 3- to 4-fold greater than when atomoxetine was given alone. Dosage adjustment of atomoxetine may be necessary and it is recommended that atomoxetine be initiated at a reduced dose when it is given with paroxetine.

 Concomitant use of PAXIL with other drugs metabolized by cytochrome CYP2D6 has not been formally studied but may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either PAXIL or the other drug.

 Therefore, coadministration of PAXIL with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including certain drugs effective in the treatment of  major≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depressive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  (e.g., nortriptyline, amitriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, and fluoxetine), phenothiazines, risperidone, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide, and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.

 However, due to the risk of serious  ventricular≠B-NonOSE_AE   arrhythmias≠I-NonOSE_AE  and  sudden≠B-NonOSE_AE   death≠I-NonOSE_AE  potentially associated with elevated plasma levels of thioridazine, paroxetine and thioridazine should not be coadministered (see  CONTRAINDICATIONS  and  WARNINGS  ).

 Tamoxifen is a pro-drug requiring metabolic activation by CYP2D6. Inhibition of CYP2D6 by paroxetine may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of an active metabolite (endoxifen) and hence reduced efficacy of tamoxifen (see  PRECAUTIONS  ).

 At steady state, when the CYP2D6 pathway is essentially saturated, paroxetine clearance is governed by alternative P450isozymes that, unlike CYP2D6, show no evidence of saturation (see  PRECAUTIONS  : Tricyclic Antidepressants [TCAs]  ).

     Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome CYP3A4:  

  An in vivo  interaction study involving the coadministration under steady-state conditions of paroxetine and terfenadine, a substrate for cytochrome CYP3A4, revealed no effect of paroxetine on terfenadine pharmacokinetics. In addition, in vitro  studies have shown ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 activity, to be at least 100 times more potent than paroxetine as an inhibitor of the metabolism of several substrates for this enzyme, including terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, triazolam, and cyclosporine. Based on the assumption that the relationship between paroxetine's in vitro  Kiand its lack of effect on terfenadine's in vivo  clearance predicts its effect on other CYP3A4 substrates, paroxetine's extent of inhibition of CYP3A4 activity is not likely to be of clinical significance.

     Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs):  

  Caution is indicated in the coadministration of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) with PAXIL, because paroxetine may inhibit TCA metabolism. Plasma TCA concentrations may need to be monitored, and the dose of TCA may need to be reduced, if a TCA is coadministered with PAXIL (see  PRECAUTIONS  : Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome CYP2D6  ).

     Drugs Highly Bound to Plasma Protein:  

  Because paroxetine is highly bound to plasma protein, administration of PAXIL to a patient taking another drug that is highly protein bound may cause increased free concentrations of the other drug, potentially resulting in adverse events. Conversely, adverse effects could result from displacement of paroxetine by other highly bound drugs.

     Drugs That Interfere With Hemostasis (e.g., NSAIDs, Aspirin, and Warfarin):  

  Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Epidemiological studies of the case-control and cohort design that have demonstrated an association between use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of upper  gastrointestinal≠B-NonOSE_AE   bleeding≠I-NonOSE_AE  have also shown that concurrent use of an NSAID or aspirin may potentiate this risk of  bleeding≠B-NonOSE_AE . Altered anticoagulant effects, including  increased≠B-NonOSE_AE   bleeding≠I-NonOSE_AE , have been reported when SSRIs or SNRIs are coadministered with warfarin. Patients receiving warfarin therapy should be carefully monitored when paroxetine is initiated or discontinued.

     Alcohol:  

  Although PAXIL does not increase the  impairment≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   mental≠I-NonOSE_AE  and motor  skills≠I-NonOSE_AE  caused by alcohol, patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking PAXIL.

     Lithium:  

  A multiple-dose study has shown that there is no pharmacokinetic interaction between PAXIL and lithium carbonate. However, due to the potential for  serotonin≠B-NonOSE_AE   syndrome≠I-NonOSE_AE , caution is advised when PAXIL is coadministered with lithium.

     Digoxin:  

  The steady-state pharmacokinetics of paroxetine was not altered when administered with digoxin at steady state. Mean digoxin AUC at steady state decreased by 15% in the presence of paroxetine. Since there is little clinical experience, the concurrent administration of paroxetine and digoxin should be undertaken with caution.

     Diazepam:  

  Under steady-state conditions, diazepam does not appear to affect paroxetine kinetics. The effects of paroxetine on diazepam were not evaluated.

     Procyclidine:  

  Daily oral dosing of PAXIL (30 mg once daily) increased steady-state AUC0-24, Cmax, and Cminvalues of procyclidine (5 mg oral once daily) by 35%, 37%, and 67%, respectively, compared to procyclidine alone at steady state. If anticholinergic effects are seen, the dose of procyclidine should be reduced.

     Beta-Blockers:  

  In a study where propranolol (80 mg twice daily) was dosed orally for 18 days, the established steady-state plasma concentrations of propranolol were unaltered during coadministration with PAXIL (30 mg once daily) for the final 10 days. The effects of propranolol on paroxetine have not been evaluated (see  ADVERSE REACTIONS: Postmarketing Reports  ).

     Theophylline:  

  Reports of elevated theophylline levels associated with treatment with PAXIL have been reported. While this interaction has not been formally studied, it is recommended that theophylline levels be monitored when these drugs are concurrently administered.

     Fosamprenavir/Ritonavir:  

  Co-administration of fosamprenavir/ritonavir with paroxetine significantly decreased plasma levels of paroxetine. Any dose adjustment should be guided by clinical effect (tolerability and efficacy).

     Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT):  

  There are no clinical studies of the combined use of ECT and PAXIL.

    Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:

    Carcinogenesis:  

  Two-year carcinogenicity studies were conducted in rodents given paroxetine in the diet at 1, 5, and 25 mg/kg/day (mice) and 1, 5, and 20 mg/kg/day (rats). These doses are up to 2.4 (mouse) and 3.9 (rat) times the MRHD for  major≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depressive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  social≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   anxiety≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  GAD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , and  PTSD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  on a mg/m  2  basis. Because the MRHD for  major≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depressive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  is slightly less than that for  OCD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  (50 mg versus 60 mg), the doses used in these carcinogenicity studies were only 2.0 (mouse) and 3.2 (rat) times the MRHD for  OCD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate . There was a significantly greater number of male rats in the high-dose group with  reticulum≠B-NonOSE_AE   cell≠I-NonOSE_AE   sarcomas≠I-NonOSE_AE  (1/100, 0/50, 0/50, and 4/50 for control, low-, middle-, and high-dose groups, respectively) and a significantly increased linear trend across dose groups for the occurrence of  lymphoreticular≠B-NonOSE_AE   tumors≠I-NonOSE_AE  in male rats. Female rats were not affected. Although there was a dose-related increase in the number of  tumors≠B-NonOSE_AE  in mice, there was no drug-related increase in the number of mice with  tumors≠B-NonOSE_AE . The relevance of these findings to humans is unknown.

     Mutagenesis:  

  Paroxetine produced no  genotoxic≠B-NonOSE_AE   effects≠I-NonOSE_AE  in a battery of 5 in vitro  and 2 in vivo  assays that included the following: Bacterial mutation assay, mouse  lymphoma≠B-NonOSE_AE  mutation assay, unscheduled DNA synthesis assay, and tests for  cytogenetic≠B-NonOSE_AE   aberrations≠I-NonOSE_AE  in vivo  in mouse bone marrow and in vitro  in human lymphocytes and in a dominant lethal test in rats.

     Impairment of Fertility:  

  Some clinical studies have shown that SSRIs (including paroxetine) may  affect≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   sperm≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   quality≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  during SSRI treatment, which may  affect≠B-NonOSE_AE   fertility≠I-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   some≠I-NonOSE_AE   men≠I-NonOSE_AE .

 A reduced  pregnancy≠B-NonOSE_AE  rate was found in reproduction studies in rats at a dose of paroxetine of 15 mg/kg/day, which is 2.9 times the MRHD for  major≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depressive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  social≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   anxiety≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  GAD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , and  PTSD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or 2.4 times the MRHD for  OCD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  on a mg/m  2  basis.  Irreversible≠B-NonOSE_AE   lesions≠I-NonOSE_AE   occurred≠I-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   the≠I-NonOSE_AE   reproductive≠I-NonOSE_AE   tract≠I-NonOSE_AE  of male rats after dosing in toxicity studies for 2 to 52 weeks. These lesions consisted of  vacuolation≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   epididymal≠I-NonOSE_AE   tubular≠I-NonOSE_AE   epithelium≠I-NonOSE_AE  at 50 mg/kg/day and  atrophic≠B-NonOSE_AE   changes≠I-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   the≠I-NonOSE_AE   seminiferous≠I-NonOSE_AE   tubules≠I-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   the≠I-NonOSE_AE   testes≠I-NonOSE_AE  with  arrested≠B-NonOSE_AE   spermatogenesis≠I-NonOSE_AE  at 25 mg/kg/day (9.8 and 4.9 times the MRHD for  major≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depressive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  social≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   anxiety≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , and  GAD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ; 8.2 and 4.1 times the MRHD for  OCD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and PD on a mg/m  2  basis).

     Pregnancy:  

   Pregnancy≠B-NonOSE_AE  Category D. See  WARNINGS: Usage in  Pregnancy≠B-NonOSE_AE   :  Teratogenic≠B-NonOSE_AE   Effects≠I-NonOSE_AE   and  Nonteratogenic≠B-NonOSE_AE   Effects≠I-NonOSE_AE   .

    Labor and Delivery:

  The effect of paroxetine on labor and delivery in humans is unknown.

    Nursing Mothers:

  Like many other drugs, paroxetine is secreted in human milk, and caution should be exercised when PAXIL is administered to a nursing woman.

    Pediatric Use:

  Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population have not been established (see  BOX WARNING  and  WARNINGS  : Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk). Three placebo-controlled trials in 752 pediatric patients with  MDD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  have been conducted with PAXIL, and the data were not sufficient to support a claim for use in pediatric patients. Anyone considering the use of PAXIL in a child or adolescent must balance the potential risks with the clinical need.  Decreased≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   appetite≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  weight≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   loss≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs. Consequently, regular monitoring of weight and growth should be performed in children and adolescents treated with an SSRI such as PAXIL.

 In placebo-controlled clinical trials conducted with pediatric patients, the following adverse events were reported in at least 2% of pediatric patients treated with PAXIL and occurred at a rate at least twice that for pediatric patients receiving placebo:  emotional≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   lability≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (including  self≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  harm≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  suicidal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   thoughts≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  attempted≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   suicide≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  crying≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  mood≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   fluctuations≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ),  hostility≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  decreased≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   appetite≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  tremor≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  sweating≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  hyperkinesia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  agitation≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .

    Geriatric Use:

  SSRIs and SNRIs, including PAXIL, have been associated with cases of clinically significant  hyponatremia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse event (see  PRECAUTIONS:  Hyponatremia≠B-NonOSE_AE   ).

 In worldwide premarketing clinical trials with PAXIL, 17% of patients treated with PAXIL (approximately 700) were 65 years of age or older. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed a decreased clearance in the elderly, and a lower starting dose is recommended; there were, however, no overall differences in the adverse event profile between elderly and younger patients, and effectiveness was similar in younger and older patients (see  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  and  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  ).
