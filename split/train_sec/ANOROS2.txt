  WARNING: ASTHMA-RELATED DEATH

    Long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists (LABA) increase the risk of  asthma≠B-NonOSE_AE -related  death≠B-NonOSE_AE . Data from a large placebo-controlled US trial that compared the safety of another LABA (salmeterol) with placebo added to usual  asthma≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  therapy showed an increase in  asthma≠B-NonOSE_AE -related  deaths≠B-NonOSE_AE  in subjects receiving salmeterol. This finding with salmeterol is considered a class effect of all LABA, including vilanterol, one of the active ingredients in ANOROTM ELLIPTA  (r)     [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]  .  



   The safety and efficacy of ANORO ELLIPTA in patients with  asthma≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  have not been established. ANORO ELLIPTA is not indicated for the treatment of  asthma≠B-Not_AE_Candidate .

 *  Long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists (LABA), such as vilanterol, one of the active ingredients in ANORO ELLIPTA, increase the risk of asthma-related death.
