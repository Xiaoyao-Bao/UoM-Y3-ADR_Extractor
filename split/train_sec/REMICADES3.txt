   5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

   EXCERPT:    *   Serious infections - do not give REMICADE during an active infection. If an infection develops, monitor carefully and stop REMICADE if infection becomes serious. (  5.1  ) 
 *   Invasive fungal infections - for patients who develop a systemic illness on REMICADE, consider empiric antifungal therapy for those who reside or travel to regions where mycoses are endemic (  5.1  ) 
 *   Malignancies - the incidence of malignancies, including invasive cervical cancer and lymphoma, was greater in REMICADE treated patients than in controls. Due to the risk of HSTCL carefully assess the risk/benefit especially if the patient has Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, is male, and is receiving azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine treatment. (  5.2  ) 
 *   Hepatitis B virus reactivation - test for HBV infection before starting REMICADE. Monitor HBV carriers during and several months after therapy. If reactivation occurs, stop REMICADE and begin anti-viral therapy. (  5.3  ) 
 *   Hepatotoxicity - severe hepatic reactions, some fatal or necessitating liver transplantation. Stop REMICADE in cases of jaundice and/or marked liver enzyme elevations. (  5.4  ) 
 *   Heart failure - new onset or worsening symptoms may occur. (  4  ,  5.5  ) 
 *   Cytopenias - advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if signs and symptoms develop, and consider stopping REMICADE. (  5.6  ) 
 *   Hypersensitivity - serious infusion reactions including anaphylaxis or serum sickness-like reactions may occur. (  5.7  ) 
 *   Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Reactions - Cerebrovascular accidents, myocardial infarctions (some fatal), and arrhythmias have been reported during and within 24 hours of initiation of REMICADE infusion. Monitor patients during REMICADE infusion and if serious reaction occurs, discontinue infusion. (  5.8  ) 
 *   Demyelinating disease - exacerbation or new onset may occur. (  5.9  ) 
 *   Lupus-like syndrome - stop REMICADE if syndrome develops. (  5.14  ) 
 *   Live vaccines or therapeutic infectious agents - should not be given with REMICADE. Bring pediatric patients up to date with all vaccinations prior to initiating REMICADE. At least a six month waiting period following birth is recommended before the administration of live vaccines to infants exposed in utero to infliximab (  5.15  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Serious Infections

  Patients treated with REMICADE are at increased risk for developing serious  infections≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  involving various organ systems and sites that may lead to hospitalization or  death≠B-NonOSE_AE .

  Opportunistic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   infections≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, or parasitic organisms including  aspergillosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  blastomycosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  candidiasis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  coccidioidomycosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  histoplasmosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  legionellosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  listeriosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  pneumocystosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  tuberculosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported with TNF-blockers. Patients have frequently presented with disseminated rather than localized disease.

 Treatment with REMICADE should not be initiated in patients with an active  infection≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , including clinically important  localized≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   infections≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Patients greater than 65 years of age, patients with co-morbid conditions and/or patients taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as corticosteroids or methotrexate may be at greater risk of  infection≠B-NonOSE_AE . The risks and benefits of treatment should be considered prior to initiating therapy in patients:

 *  with chronic or recurrent  infection≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ; 
 *  who have been  exposed≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   to≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   tuberculosis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ; 
 *  with a history of an  opportunistic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   infection≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ; 
 *  who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic  tuberculosis≠B-NonOSE_AE  or  endemic≠B-NonOSE_AE   mycoses≠I-NonOSE_AE , such as  histoplasmosis≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  coccidioidomycosis≠B-NonOSE_AE , or  blastomycosis≠B-NonOSE_AE ; or 
 *  with underlying conditions that may  predispose≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   them≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   to≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   infection≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . 
       Tuberculosis  
 

 Cases of  reactivation≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   tuberculosis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  or new  tuberculosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   infections≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been observed in patients receiving REMICADE, including patients who have previously received treatment for  latent≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or active  tuberculosis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Cases of  active≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   tuberculosis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  have also occurred in patients being treated with REMICADE during treatment for  latent≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   tuberculosis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate .

 Patients should be evaluated for  tuberculosis≠B-NonOSE_AE  risk factors and tested for  latent≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   infection≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  prior to initiating REMICADE and periodically during therapy. Treatment of  latent≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   tuberculosis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   infection≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  prior to therapy with TNF blocking agents has been shown to reduce the risk of  tuberculosis≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactivation≠I-NonOSE_AE  during therapy. Induration of 5 mm or greater with  tuberculin≠B-NonOSE_AE   skin≠I-NonOSE_AE   testing≠I-NonOSE_AE  should be considered a  positive≠I-NonOSE_AE  test result when assessing if treatment for  latent≠B-NonOSE_AE   tuberculosis≠I-NonOSE_AE  is needed prior to initiating REMICADE, even for patients previously vaccinated with  Bacille≠B-NonOSE_AE   Calmette≠I-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  Guerin≠I-NonOSE_AE   (≠I-NonOSE_AE  BCG≠I-NonOSE_AE ).

  Anti≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  tuberculosis≠I-NonOSE_AE  therapy should also be considered prior to initiation of REMICADE in patients with a past history of  latent≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or active  tuberculosis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a  negative≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   test≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   for≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   latent≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   tuberculosis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  but having risk factors for  tuberculosis≠B-NonOSE_AE   infection≠I-NonOSE_AE . Consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of  tuberculosis≠B-NonOSE_AE  is recommended to aid in the decision whether initiating  anti≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  tuberculosis≠I-NonOSE_AE  therapy is appropriate for an individual patient.

  Tuberculosis≠B-NonOSE_AE  should be strongly considered in patients who develop a new  infection≠B-NonOSE_AE  during REMICADE treatment, especially in patients who have previously or recently traveled to countries with a high prevalence of  tuberculosis≠B-NonOSE_AE , or who have had close contact with a person with  active≠B-NonOSE_AE   tuberculosis≠I-NonOSE_AE .

    Monitoring  

 Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of  infection≠B-NonOSE_AE  during and after treatment with REMICADE, including the development of  tuberculosis≠B-NonOSE_AE  in patients who  tested≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   negative≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   for≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   latent≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   tuberculosis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   infection≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  prior to initiating therapy.  Tests≠B-NonOSE_AE   for≠I-NonOSE_AE   latent≠I-NonOSE_AE   tuberculosis≠I-NonOSE_AE   infection≠I-NonOSE_AE  may also be  falsely≠I-NonOSE_AE   negative≠I-NonOSE_AE  while on therapy with REMICADE.

 REMICADE should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious  infection≠B-NonOSE_AE  or  sepsis≠B-NonOSE_AE . A patient who develops a new  infection≠B-NonOSE_AE  during treatment with REMICADE should be closely monitored, undergo a prompt and complete diagnostic workup appropriate for an  immunocompromised≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  patient, and appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be initiated.

    Invasive Fungal Infections  

 For patients who reside or travel in regions where  mycoses≠B-NonOSE_AE  are endemic,  invasive≠B-NonOSE_AE   fungal≠I-NonOSE_AE   infection≠I-NonOSE_AE  should be suspected if they develop a serious systemic  illness≠B-NonOSE_AE . Appropriate empiric antifungal therapy should be considered while a diagnostic workup is being performed.  Antigen≠B-NonOSE_AE   and≠I-NonOSE_AE   antibody≠I-NonOSE_AE   testing≠I-NonOSE_AE   for≠I-NonOSE_AE   histoplasmosis≠I-NonOSE_AE   may≠I-NonOSE_AE   be≠I-NonOSE_AE   negative≠I-NonOSE_AE  in some patients with active  infection≠B-NonOSE_AE . When feasible, the decision to administer empiric antifungal therapy in these patients should be made in consultation with a physician with expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of invasive  fungal≠B-NonOSE_AE   infections≠I-NonOSE_AE  and should take into account both the risk for severe  fungal≠B-NonOSE_AE   infection≠I-NonOSE_AE  and the risks of antifungal therapy.

    5.2 Malignancies

   Malignancies≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , some  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE , have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults who received treatment with TNF-blocking agents (initiation of therapy <=18 years of age), including REMICADE. Approximately half of these cases were  lymphomas≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , including  Hodgkin≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  '≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  s≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and non-Hodgkin's  lymphoma≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . The other cases represented a variety of  malignancies≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , including rare  malignancies≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  that are usually associated with  immunosuppression≠B-NonOSE_AE  and  malignancies≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  that are not usually observed in children and adolescents. The  malignancies≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred after a median of 30 months (range 1 to 84 months) after the first dose of TNF blocker therapy. Most of the patients were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants. These cases were reported post-marketing and are derived from a variety of sources, including registries and spontaneous postmarketing reports.

    Lymphomas  

 In the controlled portions of clinical trials of all the TNF-blocking agents, more cases of  lymphoma≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been observed among patients receiving a TNF blocker compared with control patients. In the controlled and open-label portions of REMICADE clinical trials, 5 patients developed  lymphomas≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  among 5707 patients treated with REMICADE (median duration of follow-up 1.0 years) vs. 0  lymphomas≠B-NonOSE_AE  in 1600 control patients (median duration of follow-up 0.4 years). In  rheumatoid≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   arthritis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  patients, 2  lymphomas≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  were observed for a rate of 0.08 cases per 100 patient-years of follow-up, which is approximately three-fold higher than expected in the general population. In the combined clinical trial population for  rheumatoid≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   arthritis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  Crohn≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  s≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  psoriatic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   arthritis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  ankylosing≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   spondylitis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  ulcerative≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   colitis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , and  plaque≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   psoriasis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , 5  lymphomas≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  were observed for a rate of 0.10 cases per 100 patient-years of follow-up, which is approximately four-fold higher than expected in the general population. Patients with  Crohn≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  s≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  rheumatoid≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   arthritis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  or  plaque≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   psoriasis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , particularly patients with highly active disease and/or chronic exposure to  immunosuppressant≠B-NonOSE_AE   therapies≠I-NonOSE_AE , may be at a higher risk (up to several fold) than the general population for the development of  lymphoma≠B-NonOSE_AE , even in the absence of TNF-blocking therapy. Cases of  acute≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and chronic  leukemia≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported with postmarketing TNF-blocker use in  rheumatoid≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   arthritis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and other indications. Even in the absence of TNF blocker therapy, patients with  rheumatoid≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   arthritis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  may be at a higher risk (approximately 2-fold) than the general population for the development of  leukemia≠B-NonOSE_AE .

    Hepatosplenic T-cell Lymphoma (HSTCL)  

 Postmarketing cases of  hepatosplenic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   T≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  cell≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   lymphoma≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  HSTCL≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ), a rare type of  T≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  cell≠I-NonOSE_AE   lymphoma≠I-NonOSE_AE , have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including REMICADE. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE . Almost all patients had received treatment with the immunosuppressants azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine concomitantly with a TNF-blocker at or prior to diagnosis. The majority of reported REMICADE cases have occurred in patients with  Crohn≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  s≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  or  ulcerative≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   colitis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and most were in adolescent and young adult males. It is uncertain whether the occurrence of  HSTCL≠B-NonOSE_AE  is related to TNF-blockers or TNF-blockers in combination with these other immunosuppressants. When treating patients, consideration of whether to use REMICADE alone or in combination with other immunosuppressants such as azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine should take into account a possibility that there is a higher risk of  HSTCL≠B-NonOSE_AE  with combination therapy versus an observed increased risk of  immunogenicity≠B-NonOSE_AE  and  hypersensitivity≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE  with REMICADE monotherapy from the clinical trial data [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.7)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .

     Skin≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   Cancer≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   

  Melanoma≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  Merkel≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   cell≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   carcinoma≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported in patients treated with TNF blocker therapy, including REMICADE [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ]  . Periodic skin examination is recommended for all patients, particularly those with risk factors for  skin≠B-NonOSE_AE   cancer≠I-NonOSE_AE .

     Cervical Cancer    

  A population-based retrospective cohort study using data from Swedish national health registries found a 2 to 3 fold increase in the incidence of invasive  cervical≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   cancer≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  in women with  rheumatoid≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   arthritis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  treated with infliximab compared to biologics-naive patients or the general population, particularly those over 60 years of age. A causal relationship between infliximab and  cervical≠B-NonOSE_AE   cancer≠I-NonOSE_AE  cannot be excluded. Periodic screening should continue in women treated with REMICADE [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ]  .  

    Other Malignancies  

 In the controlled portions of clinical trials of some TNF-blocking agents including REMICADE, more  malignancies≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (excluding  lymphoma≠B-NonOSE_AE  and  nonmelanoma≠B-NonOSE_AE   skin≠I-NonOSE_AE   cancer≠I-NonOSE_AE   [≠I-NonOSE_AE  NMSC≠I-NonOSE_AE ]) have been observed in patients receiving those TNF-blockers compared with control patients. During the controlled portions of REMICADE trials in patients with moderately to severely active  rheumatoid≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   arthritis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  Crohn≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  s≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  psoriatic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   arthritis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  ankylosing≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   spondylitis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  ulcerative≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   colitis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , and  plaque≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   psoriasis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , 14 patients were diagnosed with  malignancies≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (excluding  lymphoma≠B-NonOSE_AE  and  NMSC≠B-NonOSE_AE ) among 4019 REMICADE-treated patients vs. 1 among 1597 control patients (at a rate of 0.52/100 patient-years among REMICADE-treated patients vs. a rate of 0.11/100 patient-years among control patients), with median duration of follow-up 0.5 years for REMICADE-treated patients and 0.4 years for control patients. Of these, the most common  malignancies≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  were  breast≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , colorectal, and  melanoma≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . The rate of  malignancies≠B-NonOSE_AE  among REMICADE-treated patients was similar to that expected in the general population whereas the rate in control patients was lower than expected.

 In a clinical trial exploring the use of REMICADE in patients with moderate to severe  chronic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   obstructive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   pulmonary≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   (≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  COPD≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ), more  malignancies≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , the majority of lung or head and neck origin, were reported in REMICADE-treated patients compared with control patients. All patients had a history of heavy smoking [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Prescribers should exercise caution when considering the use of REMICADE in patients with moderate to severe  COPD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate .

  Psoriasis≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  patients should be monitored for  nonmelanoma≠B-NonOSE_AE   skin≠I-NonOSE_AE   cancers≠I-NonOSE_AE   (≠I-NonOSE_AE  NMSCs≠I-NonOSE_AE ), particularly those patients who have had prior prolonged phototherapy treatment. In the maintenance portion of clinical trials for REMICADE,  NMSCs≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  were more common in patients with previous phototherapy [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .

 The potential role of TNF-blocking therapy in the development of  malignancies≠B-NonOSE_AE  is not known [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  Rates in clinical trials for REMICADE cannot be compared to rates in clinical trials of other TNF-blockers and may not predict rates observed in a broader patient population. Caution should be exercised in considering REMICADE treatment in patients with a history of  malignancy≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or in continuing treatment in patients who develop  malignancy≠B-NonOSE_AE  while receiving REMICADE.

    5.3 Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation

  Use of TNF blockers, including REMICADE, has been associated with  reactivation≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   hepatitis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   B≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   virus≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  HBV≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ) in patients who are chronic carriers of this virus. In some instances,  HBV≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactivation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurring in conjunction with TNF blocker therapy has been  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE . The majority of these reports have occurred in patients concomitantly receiving other  medications≠B-NonOSE_AE   that≠I-NonOSE_AE   suppress≠I-NonOSE_AE   the≠I-NonOSE_AE   immune≠I-NonOSE_AE   system≠I-NonOSE_AE , which may also contribute to  HBV≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactivation≠I-NonOSE_AE . Patients should be tested for  HBV≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   infection≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  before initiating TNF blocker therapy, including REMICADE. For patients who  test≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   positive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   for≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   hepatitis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   B≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   surface≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   antigen≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of  hepatitis≠B-NonOSE_AE   B≠I-NonOSE_AE  is recommended. Adequate data are not available on the safety or efficacy of treating patients who are  carriers≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   of≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   HBV≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  with anti-viral therapy in conjunction with TNF blocker therapy to prevent  HBV≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactivation≠I-NonOSE_AE . Patients who are  carriers≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   of≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   HBV≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and require treatment with TNF blockers should be closely monitored for clinical and laboratory signs of active  HBV≠B-NonOSE_AE   infection≠I-NonOSE_AE  throughout therapy and for several months following termination of therapy. In patients who develop  HBV≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactivation≠I-NonOSE_AE , TNF blockers should be stopped and antiviral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated. The safety of resuming TNF blocker therapy after  HBV≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactivation≠I-NonOSE_AE  is controlled is not known. Therefore, prescribers should exercise caution when considering resumption of TNF blocker therapy in this situation and monitor patients closely.

    5.4  Hepatotoxicity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE 

  Severe  hepatic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , including  acute≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   liver≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   failure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  jaundice≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  hepatitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  cholestasis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , have been reported in postmarketing data in patients receiving REMICADE.  Autoimmune≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   hepatitis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  has been diagnosed in some of these cases. Severe  hepatic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred between 2 weeks to more than 1 year after initiation of REMICADE;  elevations≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   hepatic≠I-NonOSE_AE   aminotransferase≠I-NonOSE_AE   levels≠I-NonOSE_AE  were not noted prior to discovery of the  liver≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   injury≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  in many of these cases. Some of these cases were  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE  or necessitated  liver≠B-NonOSE_AE   transplantation≠I-NonOSE_AE . Patients with symptoms or signs of  liver≠B-NonOSE_AE   dysfunction≠I-NonOSE_AE  should be evaluated for evidence of  liver≠B-NonOSE_AE   injury≠I-NonOSE_AE . If  jaundice≠B-NonOSE_AE  and/or marked  liver≠B-NonOSE_AE   enzyme≠I-NonOSE_AE   elevations≠I-NonOSE_AE  (e.g., >=5 times the upper limit of normal) develop, REMICADE should be discontinued, and a thorough investigation of the abnormality should be undertaken. In clinical trials, mild or moderate  elevations≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  ALT and  AST≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been observed in patients receiving REMICADE without progression to severe  hepatic≠B-NonOSE_AE   injury≠I-NonOSE_AE  [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .

    5.5 Patients with Heart Failure

  REMICADE has been associated with adverse outcomes in patients with  heart≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   failure≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , and should be used in patients with  heart≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   failure≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  only after consideration of other treatment options. The results of a randomized study evaluating the use of REMICADE in patients with  heart≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   failure≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   (≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  NYHA≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   Functional≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   Class≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   III≠I-Not_AE_Candidate /IV) suggested higher  mortality≠B-NonOSE_AE  in patients who received 10 mg/kg REMICADE, and higher rates of  cardiovascular≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   adverse≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   events≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  at doses of 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg. There have been post-marketing reports of  worsening≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   heart≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   failure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , with and without identifiable precipitating factors, in patients taking REMICADE. There have also been post-marketing reports of new onset  heart≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   failure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , including  heart≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   failure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  in patients without known pre-existing  cardiovascular≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Some of these patients have been under 50 years of age. If a decision is made to administer REMICADE to patients with  heart≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   failure≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , they should be closely monitored during therapy, and REMICADE should be discontinued if new or worsening symptoms of  heart≠B-NonOSE_AE   failure≠I-NonOSE_AE  appear [see  Contraindications (4)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .

    5.6 Hematologic Reactions

  Cases of  leukopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  neutropenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  thrombocytopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  pancytopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , some with a  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE  outcome, have been reported in patients receiving REMICADE. The causal relationship to REMICADE therapy remains unclear. Although no high-risk group(s) has been identified, caution should be exercised in patients being treated with REMICADE who have ongoing or a history of significant  hematologic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   abnormalities≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . All patients should be advised to seek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of  blood≠B-NonOSE_AE   dyscrasias≠I-NonOSE_AE  or  infection≠B-NonOSE_AE  (e.g., persistent  fever≠B-NonOSE_AE ) while on REMICADE. Discontinuation of REMICADE therapy should be considered in patients who develop significant  hematologic≠B-NonOSE_AE   abnormalities≠I-NonOSE_AE .

    5.7 Hypersensitivity

  REMICADE has been associated with  hypersensitivity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  that vary in their time of onset and required hospitalization in some cases. Most  hypersensitivity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , which include  anaphylaxis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  urticaria≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  dyspnea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and/or  hypotension≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , have occurred during or within 2 hours of REMICADE infusion.

 However, in some cases,  serum≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   sickness≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  like≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been observed in patients after initial REMICADE therapy (i.e., as early as after the second dose), and when REMICADE therapy was reinstituted following an extended period without REMICADE treatment. Symptoms associated with these reactions include  fever≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  rash≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  headache≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  sore≠B-NonOSE_AE   throat≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  myalgias≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  polyarthralgias≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  hand≠B-NonOSE_AE  and facial  edema≠I-NonOSE_AE  and/or  dysphagia≠B-NonOSE_AE . These reactions were associated with a marked increase in  antibodies≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   to≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infliximab≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , loss of detectable serum concentrations of infliximab, and possible loss of drug efficacy.

 REMICADE should be discontinued for severe  hypersensitivity≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE . Medications for the treatment of  hypersensitivity≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE  (e.g., acetaminophen, antihistamines, corticosteroids and/or epinephrine) should be available for immediate use in the event of a reaction [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .

 In  rheumatoid≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   arthritis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  Crohn≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  s≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and  psoriasis≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  clinical trials, re-administration of REMICADE after a period of no treatment resulted in a higher incidence of  infusion≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  relative to regular maintenance treatment [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . In general, the benefit-risk of re-administration of REMICADE after a period of no-treatment, especially as a re-induction regimen given at weeks 0, 2 and 6, should be carefully considered. In the case where REMICADE maintenance therapy for  psoriasis≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  is interrupted, REMICADE should be reinitiated as a single dose followed by maintenance therapy.

    5.8 Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Reactions During and After Infusion

   Serious  cerebrovascular≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   accidents≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  myocardial≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  ischemia/ infarction≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (some  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE ),  hypotension≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  hypertension≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  arrhythmias≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported during and within 24 hours of initiation of REMICADE infusion. Cases of  transient≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   visual≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   loss≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported during or within 2 hours of infusion of REMICADE. Monitor patients during infusion and if serious reaction occurs, discontinue infusion. Further management of reactions should be dictated by signs and symptoms [See  Adverse Reactions (6)  ]  .  

    5.9 Neurologic Reactions

  REMICADE and other agents that inhibit TNF have been associated with CNS manifestation of  systemic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   vasculitis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  seizure≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and new onset or exacerbation of clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of  central≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   nervous≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   system≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   demyelinating≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   disorders≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , including  multiple≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   sclerosis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  optic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   neuritis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  peripheral≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   demyelinating≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   disorders≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , including  Guillain≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  Barre≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   syndrome≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . Prescribers should exercise caution in considering the use of REMICADE in patients with these  neurologic≠B-NonOSE_AE   disorders≠I-NonOSE_AE  and should consider discontinuation of REMICADE if these disorders develop.

    5.10 Use with Anakinra

  Serious  infections≠B-NonOSE_AE  and  neutropenia≠B-NonOSE_AE  were seen in clinical studies with concurrent use of anakinra and another TNFalpha-blocking agent, etanercept, with no added clinical benefit compared to etanercept alone. Because of the nature of the adverse reactions seen with the combination of etanercept and anakinra therapy, similar toxicities may also result from the combination of anakinra and other TNFalpha-blocking agents. Therefore, the combination of REMICADE and anakinra is not recommended.

    5.11 Use with Abatacept

  In clinical studies, concurrent administration of TNF-blocking agents and abatacept have been associated with an increased risk of  infections≠B-NonOSE_AE  including serious  infections≠B-NonOSE_AE  compared with TNF -  blocking agents alone, without increased clinical benefit. Therefore, the combination of REMICADE and abatacept is not recommended [see  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ]  .

    5.12 Concurrent Administration with Other Biological Therapeutics

  There is insufficient information regarding the concomitant use of REMICADE with other biological therapeutics used to treat the same conditions as REMICADE. The concomitant use of REMICADE with these biologics is not recommended because of the possibility of an increased risk of  infection≠B-NonOSE_AE  [see  Drug Interactions (7.3)  ]  .

    5.13 Switching Between Biological Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (DMARDs)

  Care should be taken when switching from one biologic to another, since overlapping biological activity may further increase the risk of  infection≠B-NonOSE_AE .

    5.14 Autoimmunity

  Treatment with REMICADE may result in the  formation≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   autoantibodies≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and in the development of a  lupus≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  like≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   syndrome≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . If a patient develops symptoms suggestive of a  lupus≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  like≠I-NonOSE_AE   syndrome≠I-NonOSE_AE  following treatment with REMICADE, treatment should be discontinued [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .

    5.15 Live Vaccines/Therapeutic Infectious Agents

  In patients receiving anti-TNF therapy, limited data are available on the response to vaccination with live vaccines or on the  secondary≠B-NonOSE_AE   transmission≠I-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   infection≠I-NonOSE_AE   by≠I-NonOSE_AE   live≠I-NonOSE_AE   vaccines≠I-NonOSE_AE . Use of live vaccines can result in clinical  infections≠B-NonOSE_AE , including  disseminated≠B-NonOSE_AE   infections≠I-NonOSE_AE . The concurrent administration of live vaccines with REMICADE is not recommended.

  Fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE  outcome due to  disseminated≠B-NonOSE_AE   BCG≠I-NonOSE_AE   infection≠I-NonOSE_AE  has been reported in an infant who received a BCG vaccine after  in≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   utero≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE    exposure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   to≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infliximab≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . Infliximab is known to cross the placenta and has been detected up to 6 months following birth. At least a six month waiting period following birth is recommended before the administration of any live vaccine to infants exposed in utero  to infliximab.

 Other uses of therapeutic infectious agents such as live attenuated bacteria (e.g., BCG bladder instillation for the treatment of  cancer≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ) could result in clinical  infections≠B-NonOSE_AE , including  disseminated≠B-NonOSE_AE   infections≠I-NonOSE_AE . It is recommended that  therapeutic≠B-NonOSE_AE   infectious≠I-NonOSE_AE   agents≠I-NonOSE_AE  not be given concurrently with REMICADE.

 It is recommended that all pediatric patients be brought up to date with all vaccinations prior to initiating REMICADE therapy. The interval between vaccination and initiation of REMICADE therapy should be in accordance with current vaccination guidelines.
