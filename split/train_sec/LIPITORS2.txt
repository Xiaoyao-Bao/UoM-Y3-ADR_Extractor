   5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

   EXCERPT:    *  Skeletal muscle effects (e.g., myopathy and rhabdomyolysis): Risks increase when higher doses are used concomitantly with cyclosporine and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors). Predisposing factors include advanced age (> 65), uncontrolled hypothyroidism, and renal impairment. Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported. Advise patients to promptly report to their physician unexplained and/or persistent muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness. LIPITOR therapy should be discontinued if myopathy is diagnosed or suspected (  5.1  ,  8.5  ). 
 *  Liver enzyme abnormalities: Persistent elevations in hepatic transaminases can occur. Check liver enzyme tests before initiating therapy and as clinically indicated thereafter (  5.2  ). 
 *  A higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was seen in patients without CHD but with stroke or TIA within the previous 6 months in the LIPITOR 80 mg group vs. placebo (  5.5  ). 
    
 

   5.1 Skeletal Muscle

   Rare cases of  rhabdomyolysis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  with  acute≠B-NonOSE_AE   renal≠I-NonOSE_AE   failure≠I-NonOSE_AE  secondary to  myoglobinuria≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported with LIPITOR and with other drugs in this class.  A history of  renal≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   impairment≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  may be a risk factor for the development of  rhabdomyolysis≠B-NonOSE_AE . Such patients merit closer monitoring for skeletal muscle effects.

 Atorvastatin, like other statins, occasionally causes  myopathy≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , defined as  muscle≠B-NonOSE_AE   aches≠I-NonOSE_AE  or  muscle≠B-NonOSE_AE   weakness≠I-NonOSE_AE  in conjunction with  increases≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   creatine≠I-NonOSE_AE   phosphokinase≠I-NonOSE_AE   (≠I-NonOSE_AE  CPK≠I-NonOSE_AE ) values >10 times ULN. The concomitant use of higher doses of atorvastatin with certain drugs such as cyclosporine and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole, and HIV protease inhibitors) increases the risk of  myopathy≠B-NonOSE_AE / rhabdomyolysis≠B-NonOSE_AE .

 There have been rare reports of  immune≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  mediated≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   necrotizing≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   myopathy≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  IMNM≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ), an  autoimmune≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   myopathy≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , associated with statin use.  IMNM≠B-NonOSE_AE  is characterized by:  proximal≠B-NonOSE_AE   muscle≠I-NonOSE_AE   weakness≠I-NonOSE_AE  and  elevated≠B-NonOSE_AE   serum≠I-NonOSE_AE   creatine≠I-NonOSE_AE   kinase≠I-NonOSE_AE , which persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment; muscle biopsy showing  necrotizing≠B-NonOSE_AE   myopathy≠I-NonOSE_AE  without significant  inflammation≠B-NonOSE_AE ; improvement with  immunosuppressive≠B-NonOSE_AE   agents≠I-NonOSE_AE .

  Myopathy≠B-NonOSE_AE  should be considered in any patient with diffuse  myalgias≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  muscle≠B-NonOSE_AE  tenderness or  weakness≠I-NonOSE_AE , and/or marked  elevation≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   CPK≠I-NonOSE_AE . Patients should be advised to report promptly unexplained  muscle≠B-NonOSE_AE   pain≠I-NonOSE_AE , tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by  malaise≠B-NonOSE_AE  or  fever≠B-NonOSE_AE  or if  muscle≠B-NonOSE_AE   signs≠I-NonOSE_AE   and≠I-NonOSE_AE   symptoms≠I-NonOSE_AE  persist after discontinuing LIPITOR. LIPITOR therapy should be discontinued if markedly  elevated≠B-NonOSE_AE   CPK≠I-NonOSE_AE   levels≠I-NonOSE_AE  occur or  myopathy≠B-NonOSE_AE  is diagnosed or suspected.

 The risk of  myopathy≠B-NonOSE_AE  during treatment with drugs in this class is increased with concurrent administration of cyclosporine, fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, combinations of HIV protease inhibitors, including saquinavir plus ritonavir, lopinavir plus ritonavir, tipranavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, and fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, niacin, or azole antifungals. Physicians considering combined therapy with LIPITOR and fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, a combination of saquinavir plus ritonavir, lopinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, azole antifungals, or lipid-modifying doses of niacin should carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks and should carefully monitor patients for any signs or symptoms of  muscle≠B-NonOSE_AE   pain≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  tenderness≠B-NonOSE_AE , or  weakness≠B-NonOSE_AE , particularly during the initial months of therapy and during any periods of upward dosage titration of either drug. Lower starting and maintenance doses of atorvastatin should be considered when taken concomitantly with the aforementioned drugs [see  Drug Interactions (7)  ]  . Periodic creatine phosphokinase (CPK) determinations may be considered in such situations, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent the occurrence of severe  myopathy≠B-NonOSE_AE .

 Prescribing recommendations for interacting agents are summarized in Table 2 [see  Dosage and Administration (2.6)  ,  Drug Interactions (7)  , and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  .

 Table 2. Drug Interactions Associated with Increased Risk of Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis 
 Interacting Agents                                       Prescribing Recommendations                     
  
 Cyclosporine, HIV protease inhibitors (tipranavir plus ritonavir), hepatitis C protease inhibitor (telaprevir)  Avoid atorvastatin                              
 HIV protease inhibitor (lopinavir plus ritonavir)        Use with caution and lowest dose necessary      
 Clarithromycin, itraconazole,HIV protease inhibitors (saquinavir plus ritonavir [note: Use with caution and with the lowest dose necessary (12.3)] , darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, fosamprenavir plus ritonavir)  Do not exceed 20 mg atorvastatin daily          
 HIV protease inhibitor (nelfinavir)Hepatitis C protease inhibitor (boceprevir)  Do not exceed 40 mg atorvastatin daily          
        Cases of  myopathy≠B-NonOSE_AE , including  rhabdomyolysis≠B-NonOSE_AE , have been reported with atorvastatin co-administered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing atorvastatin with colchicine [see  Drug Interactions (7.11)  ]  .
 

  LIPITOR therapy should be temporarily withheld or discontinued in any patient with an acute, serious condition suggestive of a  myopathy≠B-NonOSE_AE  or having a risk factor predisposing to the development of  renal≠B-NonOSE_AE   failure≠I-NonOSE_AE  secondary to  rhabdomyolysis≠B-NonOSE_AE  (e.g., severe  acute≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   infection≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  hypotension≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , major surgery, trauma, severe  metabolic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , endocrine and electrolyte  disorders≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , and  uncontrolled≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   seizures≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ).  

    5.2  Liver≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   Dysfunction≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE 

  Statins, like some other lipid-lowering therapies, have been associated with biochemical  abnormalities≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   liver≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   function≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . Persistent  elevations≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (>3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] occurr in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE g on 2 or more occasions) in  serum≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   transaminases≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred in 0.7% of patients who received LIPITOR in clinical trials. The incidence of these abnormalities was 0.2%, 0.2%, 0.6%, and 2.3% for 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg, respectively.  

 One patient in clinical trials developed  jaundice≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .  Increases≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   liver≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   function≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   tests≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (LFT) in other patients were not associated with  jaundice≠B-NonOSE_AE  or other clinical signs or symptoms. Upon dose reduction, drug interruption, or discontinuation, transaminase levels returned to or near pretreatment levels without sequelae. Eighteen of 30 patients with  persistent≠B-NonOSE_AE   LFT≠I-NonOSE_AE   elevations≠I-NonOSE_AE  continued treatment with a reduced dose of LIPITOR.

 It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be obtained prior to initiating therapy with LIPITOR and repeated as clinically indicated. There have been rare postmarketing reports of  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE  and non-fatal  hepatic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   failure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  in patients taking statins, including atorvastatin. If serious  liver≠B-NonOSE_AE   injury≠I-NonOSE_AE  with clinical symptoms and/or  hyperbilirubinemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  or  jaundice≠B-NonOSE_AE  occurs during treatment with LIPITOR, promptly interrupt therapy. If an alternate etiology is not found, do not restart LIPITOR.

 LIPITOR should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of  liver≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate .  Active≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   liver≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  or  unexplained≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   persistent≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   transaminase≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   elevations≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  are contraindications to the use of LIPITOR [see  Contraindications (4)  ]  .

    5.3 Endocrine Function

   Increases≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   HbA≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  1≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  c≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including LIPITOR.

 Statins interfere with cholesterol synthesis and theoretically might blunt adrenal and/or gonadal steroid production. Clinical studies have shown that LIPITOR does not  reduce≠B-NonOSE_AE   basal≠I-NonOSE_AE   plasma≠I-NonOSE_AE   cortisol≠I-NonOSE_AE   concentration≠I-NonOSE_AE  or  impair≠B-NonOSE_AE   adrenal≠I-NonOSE_AE   reserve≠I-NonOSE_AE . The effects of statins on male fertility have not been studied in adequate numbers of patients. The effects, if any, on the pituitary-gonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown. Caution should be exercised if a statin is administered concomitantly with drugs that may  decrease≠B-NonOSE_AE   the≠I-NonOSE_AE   levels≠I-NonOSE_AE   or≠I-NonOSE_AE   activity≠I-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   endogenous≠I-NonOSE_AE   steroid≠I-NonOSE_AE   hormones≠I-NonOSE_AE , such as ketoconazole, spironolactone, and cimetidine.

    5.4 CNS Toxicity

   Brain≠B-NonOSE_AE   hemorrhage≠I-NonOSE_AE  was seen in a female dog treated for 3 months at 120 mg/kg/day.  Brain≠B-NonOSE_AE   hemorrhage≠I-NonOSE_AE  and  optic≠B-NonOSE_AE   nerve≠I-NonOSE_AE   vacuolation≠I-NonOSE_AE  were seen in another female dog that was sacrificed in moribund condition after 11 weeks of escalating doses up to 280 mg/kg/day. The 120 mg/kg dose resulted in a systemic exposure approximately 16 times the human plasma area-under-the-curve (AUC, 0-24 hours) based on the maximum human dose of 80 mg/day. A single  tonic≠B-NonOSE_AE   convulsion≠I-NonOSE_AE  was seen in each of 2 male dogs (one treated at 10 mg/kg/day and one at 120 mg/kg/day) in a 2-year study. No  CNS≠B-NonOSE_AE   lesions≠I-NonOSE_AE  have been observed in mice after chronic treatment for up to 2 years at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day or in rats at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day. These doses were 6 to 11 times (mouse) and 8 to 16 times (rat) the human AUC (0-24) based on the maximum recommended human dose of 80 mg/day.

  CNS≠B-NonOSE_AE   vascular≠I-NonOSE_AE   lesions≠I-NonOSE_AE , characterized by  perivascular≠B-NonOSE_AE   hemorrhages≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  edema≠B-NonOSE_AE , and  mononuclear≠B-NonOSE_AE   cell≠I-NonOSE_AE   infiltration≠I-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   perivascular≠I-NonOSE_AE   spaces≠I-NonOSE_AE , have been observed in dogs treated with other members of this class. A chemically similar drug in this class produced  optic≠B-NonOSE_AE   nerve≠I-NonOSE_AE   degeneration≠I-NonOSE_AE  ( Wallerian≠B-NonOSE_AE   degeneration≠I-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   retinogeniculate≠I-NonOSE_AE   fibers≠I-NonOSE_AE ) in clinically normal dogs in a dose-dependent fashion at a dose that produced plasma drug levels about 30 times higher than the mean drug level in humans taking the highest recommended dose.

    5.5 Use in Patients with Recent Stroke or TIA

  In a post-hoc analysis of the  Stroke≠B-NonOSE_AE  Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) study where LIPITOR 80 mg vs. placebo was administered in 4,731 subjects without  CHD≠B-NonOSE_AE  who had a  stroke≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or  TIA≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  within the preceding 6 months, a higher incidence of  hemorrhagic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   stroke≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  was seen in the LIPITOR 80 mg group compared to placebo (55, 2.3% atorvastatin vs. 33, 1.4% placebo; HR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.09, 2.59; p=0.0168). The incidence of  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE   hemorrhagic≠B-NonOSE_AE   stroke≠I-NonOSE_AE  was similar across treatment groups (17 vs. 18 for the atorvastatin and placebo groups, respectively). The incidence of nonfatal  hemorrhagic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   stroke≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  was significantly higher in the atorvastatin group (38, 1.6%) as compared to the placebo group (16, 0.7%). Some baseline characteristics, including  hemorrhagic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and lacunar  stroke≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  on study entry, were associated with a higher incidence of  hemorrhagic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   stroke≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  in the atorvastatin group [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .
