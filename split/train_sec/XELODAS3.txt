   5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

   EXCERPT:    *   Coagulopathy : May result in bleeding, death. Monitor anticoagulant response (e.g., INR) and adjust anticoagulant dose accordingly. (  5.1  ) 
 *   Diarrhea : May be severe. Interrupt XELODA treatment immediately until diarrhea resolves or decreases to grade 1. Recommend standard antidiarrheal treatments. (  5.2  ) 
 *   Cardiotoxicity : Common in patients with a prior history of coronary artery disease. (  5.3  ) 
 *   Increased Risk of Severe or Fatal Adverse Reactions in Patients with Low or Absent Dihydropyrimidine Dehydrogenase (DPD) Activity: Withhold or permanently discontinue XELODA in patients with evidence of acute early-onset or unusually severe toxicity, which may indicate near complete or total absence of DPD activity. No XELODA dose has been proven safe in patients with absent DPD activity. (  5.4  ) 
 *   Dehydration and Renal Failure : Interrupt XELODA treatment until dehydration is corrected. Potential risk of acute renal failure secondary to dehydration. Monitor and correct dehydration. (  5.5  ). 
 *   Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. (  5.6  ,  8.1  ,  8.3  ) 
 *   Mucocutaneous and Dermatologic Toxicity : Severe mucocutaneous reactions, Steven-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN), have been reported. XELODA should be permanently discontinued in patients who experience a severe mucocutaneous reaction during treatment. XELODA may induce hand-and-foot syndrome. Persistent or severe hand-and-foot syndrome can lead to loss of fingerprints which could impact patient identification. Interrupt XELODA treatment until the hand-and-foot syndrome event resolves or decreases in intensity. (  5.7  ) 
 *   Hyperbilirubinemia : Interrupt XELODA treatment immediately until the hyperbilirubinemia resolves or decreases in intensity. (  5.8  ) 
 *   Hematologic : Do not treat patients with neutrophil counts <1.5 * 10  9  /L or thrombocyte counts <100 * 10  9  /L. If grade 3-4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia occurs, stop therapy until condition resolves. (  5.9  ) 
    
 

   5.1  Coagulopathy≠B-NonOSE_AE 

  Patients receiving concomitant capecitabine and oral coumarin-derivative anticoagulant therapy should have their anticoagulant response (INR or prothrombin time) monitored closely with great frequency and the anticoagulant dose should be adjusted accordingly [see  Boxed Warning  and  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ].  

    5.2 Diarrhea

  XELODA can induce  diarrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , sometimes severe. Patients with severe  diarrhea≠B-NonOSE_AE  should be carefully monitored and given fluid and electrolyte replacement if they become dehydrated. In 875 patients with either metastatic  breast≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or colorectal  cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  who received XELODA monotherapy, the median time to first occurrence of grade 2 to 4  diarrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was 34 days (range from 1 to 369 days). The median duration of grade 3 to 4  diarrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was 5 days. National Cancer Institute of Canada (NCIC) grade 2  diarrhea≠B-NonOSE_AE  is defined as an  increase≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   4≠I-NonOSE_AE   to≠I-NonOSE_AE   6≠I-NonOSE_AE   stools≠I-NonOSE_AE  /≠I-NonOSE_AE  day≠I-NonOSE_AE   or≠I-NonOSE_AE   nocturnal≠I-NonOSE_AE   stools≠I-NonOSE_AE , grade 3  diarrhea≠B-NonOSE_AE  as an  increase≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   7≠I-NonOSE_AE   to≠I-NonOSE_AE   9≠I-NonOSE_AE   stools≠I-NonOSE_AE  /≠I-NonOSE_AE  day≠I-NonOSE_AE  or  incontinence≠B-NonOSE_AE  and  malabsorption≠B-NonOSE_AE , and grade 4  diarrhea≠B-NonOSE_AE  as an  increase≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   >≠I-NonOSE_AE  =≠I-NonOSE_AE  1≠I-NonOSE_AE  0≠I-NonOSE_AE   stools≠I-NonOSE_AE  /≠I-NonOSE_AE  day≠I-NonOSE_AE  or  grossly≠B-NonOSE_AE   bloody≠I-NonOSE_AE   diarrhea≠I-NonOSE_AE  or the need for parenteral support. If grade 2, 3 or 4  diarrhea≠B-NonOSE_AE  occurs, administration of XELODA should be immediately interrupted until the  diarrhea≠B-NonOSE_AE  resolves or decreases in intensity to grade 1 [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  . Standard antidiarrheal treatments (e.g., loperamide) are recommended.

  Necrotizing≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   enterocolitis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  ( typhlitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ) has been reported.

    5.3 Cardiotoxicity

  The  cardiotoxicity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  observed with XELODA includes  myocardial≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  infarction/ ischemia≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  angina≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  dysrhythmias≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  cardiac≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   arrest≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  cardiac≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   failure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  sudden≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   death≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  electrocardiographic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   changes≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  cardiomyopathy≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . These adverse reactions may be more common in patients with a prior history of  coronary≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   artery≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate .

    5.4 Dihydropyrimidine Dehydrogenase Deficiency

  Based on postmarketing reports, patients with certain homozygous or certain compound heterozygous mutations in the DPD gene that result in complete or near complete  absence≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   of≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   DPD≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   activity≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  are at increased risk for acute early-onset of toxicity and severe, life-threatening, or  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE  adverse reactions caused by XELODA (e.g.,  mucositis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  diarrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  neutropenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  neurotoxicity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ). Patients with partial DPD activity may also have increased risk of severe, life-threatening, or  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE  adverse reactions caused by XELODA.

 Withhold or permanently discontinue XELODA based on clinical assessment of the onset, duration and severity of the observed toxicities in patients with evidence of acute early-onset or unusually severe toxicity, which may indicate near complete or total absence of DPD activity. No XELODA dose has been proven safe for patients with complete absence of DPD activity. There is insufficient data to recommend a specific dose in patients with partial DPD activity as measured by any specific test.

    5.5 Dehydration and Renal Failure

   Dehydration≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  has been observed and may cause  acute≠B-NonOSE_AE   renal≠I-NonOSE_AE   failure≠I-NonOSE_AE  which can be  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE . Patients with pre-existing  compromised≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   renal≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   function≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  or who are receiving concomitant XELODA with known  nephrotoxic≠B-NonOSE_AE   agents≠I-NonOSE_AE  are at higher risk. Patients with  anorexia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ,  asthenia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ,  nausea≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ,  vomiting≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or  diarrhea≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  may rapidly become  dehydrated≠B-NonOSE_AE . Monitor patients when XELODA is administered to prevent and correct  dehydration≠B-NonOSE_AE  at the onset. If grade 2 (or higher)  dehydration≠B-NonOSE_AE  occurs, XELODA treatment should be immediately interrupted and the  dehydration≠B-NonOSE_AE  corrected. Treatment should not be restarted until the patient is rehydrated and any precipitating causes have been corrected or controlled. Dose modifications should be applied for the precipitating adverse event as necessary [ see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)    ].

 Patients with moderate  renal≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   impairment≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  at baseline require dose reduction [see  Dosage and Administration (2.4)  ]  . Patients with mild and moderate  renal≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   impairment≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  at baseline should be carefully monitored for adverse reactions. Prompt interruption of therapy with subsequent dose adjustments is recommended if a patient develops a grade 2 to 4 adverse event as outlined in   Table 2     [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ,  Use in Specific Populations (8.7)  , and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  .

    5.6  Embryo≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  Fetal≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   Toxicity≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE 

   Based on findings from animal reproduction studies and its mechanism of action, XELODA may cause  fetal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   harm≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  when given to a  pregnant≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  woman [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)  ]  . Limited available data are not sufficient to inform use of XELODA in  pregnant≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  women. In animal reproduction studies, administration of capecitabine to  pregnant≠B-NonOSE_AE  animals during the period of organogenesis caused  embryolethality≠B-NonOSE_AE  and  teratogenicity≠B-NonOSE_AE  in mice and  embryolethality≠B-NonOSE_AE  in monkeys at 0.2 and 0.6 times the exposure (AUC) in patients receiving the recommended dose respectively [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ]  . Apprise  pregnant≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  women of the potential  risk≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   to≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   a≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   fetus≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months following the last dose of XELODA [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.3)  ]  .  

    5.7  Mucocutaneous≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and Dermatologic  Toxicity≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE 

   Severe  mucocutaneous≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , some with  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE  outcome, such as  Stevens≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  Johnson≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   syndrome≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  Toxic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   Epidermal≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   Necrolysis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  TEN≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ) can occur in patients treated with XELODA [ see  Adverse Reactions (6.4)    ]. XELODA should be permanently discontinued in patients who experience a severe  mucocutaneous≠B-NonOSE_AE   reaction≠I-NonOSE_AE  possibly attributable to XELODA treatment.  

  Hand≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  foot≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   syndrome≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  ( palmar≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  plantar≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   erythrodysesthesia≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  or  chemotherapy≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  induced≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   acral≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   erythema≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ) is a  cutaneous≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   toxicity≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . Median time to onset was 79 days (range from 11 to 360 days) with a severity range of grades 1 to 3 for patients receiving XELODA monotherapy in the metastatic setting. Grade 1 is characterized by any of the following:  numbness≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  dysesthesia≠B-NonOSE_AE / paresthesia≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  tingling≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  painless≠B-NonOSE_AE   swelling≠I-NonOSE_AE  or erythema  of≠I-NonOSE_AE   the≠I-NonOSE_AE   hands≠I-NonOSE_AE  and/or feet and/or discomfort which does not disrupt normal activities. Grade 2  hand≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  and≠I-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  foot≠I-NonOSE_AE   syndrome≠I-NonOSE_AE  is defined as  painful≠B-NonOSE_AE   erythema≠I-NonOSE_AE  and swelling  of≠I-NonOSE_AE   the≠I-NonOSE_AE   hands≠I-NonOSE_AE  and/or feet and/or discomfort affecting the patient's activities of daily living. Grade 3  hand≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  and≠I-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  foot≠I-NonOSE_AE   syndrome≠I-NonOSE_AE  is defined as  moist≠B-NonOSE_AE   desquamation≠I-NonOSE_AE , ulceration, blistering or severe pain of the  hands≠I-NonOSE_AE  and/or feet and/or severe discomfort that causes the patient to be  unable≠B-NonOSE_AE   to≠I-NonOSE_AE   work≠I-NonOSE_AE   or≠I-NonOSE_AE   perform≠I-NonOSE_AE   activities≠I-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   daily≠I-NonOSE_AE   living≠I-NonOSE_AE . Persistent or severe  hand≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  and≠I-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  foot≠I-NonOSE_AE   syndrome≠I-NonOSE_AE  (grade 2 and above) can eventually lead to  loss≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   fingerprints≠I-NonOSE_AE  which could impact patient identification. If grade 2 or 3  hand≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  and≠I-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  foot≠I-NonOSE_AE   syndrome≠I-NonOSE_AE  occurs, administration of XELODA should be interrupted until the event resolves or decreases in intensity to grade 1. Following grade 3  hand≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  and≠I-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  foot≠I-NonOSE_AE   syndrome≠I-NonOSE_AE , subsequent doses of XELODA should be decreased [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .

    5.8 Hyperbilirubinemia

  In 875 patients with either metastatic  breast≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or colorectal  cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  who received at least one dose of XELODA 1250 mg/m  2  twice daily as monotherapy for 2 weeks followed by a 1-week rest period, grade 3 (1.5-3 * ULN)  hyperbilirubinemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred in 15.2% (n=133) of patients and grade 4 (>3 * ULN)  hyperbilirubinemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred in 3.9% (n=34) of patients. Of 566 patients who had  hepatic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   metastases≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  at baseline and 309 patients without  hepatic≠B-NonOSE_AE   metastases≠I-NonOSE_AE  at baseline, grade 3 or 4  hyperbilirubinemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred in 22.8% and 12.3%, respectively. Of the 167 patients with grade 3 or 4  hyperbilirubinemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , 18.6% (n=31) also had postbaseline  elevations≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (grades 1 to 4, without elevations at baseline) in  alkaline≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   phosphatase≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and 27.5% (n=46) had postbaseline  elevations≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   transaminases≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  at any time (not necessarily concurrent). The majority of these patients, 64.5% (n=20) and 71.7% (n=33), had  liver≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   metastases≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  at baseline. In addition, 57.5% (n=96) and 35.3% (n=59) of the 167 patients had  elevations≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (grades 1 to 4) at both prebaseline and postbaseline in alkaline phosphatase or  transaminases≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , respectively. Only 7.8% (n=13) and 3.0% (n=5) had grade 3 or 4  elevations≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  alkaline phosphatase or  transaminases≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE .

 In the 596 patients treated with XELODA as first-line therapy for metastatic  colorectal≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , the incidence of grade 3 or 4  hyperbilirubinemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was similar to the overall clinical trial safety database of XELODA monotherapy. The median time to onset for grade 3 or 4  hyperbilirubinemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  in the  colorectal≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  population was 64 days and median  total≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   bilirubin≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   increased≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  from 8 um/L at baseline to 13 um/L during treatment with XELODA. Of the 136  colorectal≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  patients with grade 3 or 4  hyperbilirubinemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , 49 patients had grade 3 or 4  hyperbilirubinemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  as their last measured value, of which 46 had  liver≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   metastases≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  at baseline.

 In 251 patients with metastatic  breast≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  who received a combination of XELODA and docetaxel, grade 3 (1.5 to 3 * ULN)  hyperbilirubinemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred in 7% (n=17) and grade 4 (>3 * ULN)  hyperbilirubinemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred in 2% (n=5).

 If drug-related grade 3 to 4  elevations≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   bilirubin≠I-NonOSE_AE  occur, administration of XELODA should be immediately interrupted until the  hyperbilirubinemia≠B-NonOSE_AE   decreases≠I-NonOSE_AE  to <=3.0 * ULN [  see recommended dose modifications under   Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .

    5.9 Hematologic

  In 875 patients with either metastatic  breast≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or colorectal  cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  who received a dose of 1250 mg/m  2  administered twice daily as monotherapy for 2 weeks followed by a 1-week rest period, 3.2%, 1.7%, and 2.4% of patients had grade 3 or 4  neutropenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  thrombocytopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  or  decreases≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   hemoglobin≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , respectively. In 251 patients with metastatic  breast≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  who received a dose of XELODA in combination with docetaxel, 68% had grade 3 or 4  neutropenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , 2.8% had grade 3 or 4  thrombocytopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and 9.6% had grade 3 or 4  anemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .

 Patients with baseline  neutrophil≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   counts≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   of≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   <≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  1≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  .≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  5≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   *≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   1≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  0≠I-Not_AE_Candidate    9≠I-Not_AE_Candidate    /≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  L≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and/or  thrombocyte≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   counts≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   of≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   <≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  1≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  0≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  0≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   *≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   1≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  0≠I-Not_AE_Candidate    9≠I-Not_AE_Candidate    /≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  L≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  should not be treated with XELODA. If unscheduled laboratory assessments during a treatment cycle show grade 3 or 4  hematologic≠B-NonOSE_AE   toxicity≠I-NonOSE_AE , treatment with XELODA should be interrupted.

    5.10 Geriatric Patients

  Patients >=80 years old may experience a greater incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions. In 875 patients with either metastatic  breast≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or colorectal  cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  who received XELODA monotherapy, 62% of the 21 patients >=80 years of age treated with XELODA experienced a treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse event:  diarrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  in 6 (28.6%),  nausea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  in 3 (14.3%),  hand≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  foot≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   syndrome≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  in 3 (14.3%), and  vomiting≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  in 2 (9.5%) patients. Among the 10 patients 70 years of age and greater (no patients were >80 years of age) treated with XELODA in combination with docetaxel, 30% (3 out of 10) of patients experienced grade 3 or 4  diarrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  stomatitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and 40% (4 out of 10) experienced grade 3  hand≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  foot≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   syndrome≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE .

 Among the 67 patients >=60 years of age receiving XELODA in combination with docetaxel, the incidence of grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse reactions, treatment-related serious adverse reactions, withdrawals due to adverse reactions, treatment discontinuations due to adverse reactions and treatment discontinuations within the first two treatment cycles was higher than in the <60 years of age patient group.

 In 995 patients receiving XELODA as adjuvant therapy for  Dukes≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   C≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   colon≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  after  resection≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   of≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   the≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   primary≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   tumor≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , 41% of the 398 patients >=65 years of age treated with XELODA experienced a treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse event:  hand≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  foot≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   syndrome≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  in 75 (18.8%),  diarrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  in 52 (13.1%),  stomatitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  in 12 (3.0%),  neutropenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE / granulocytopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  in 11 (2.8%),  vomiting≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  in 6 (1.5%), and  nausea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  in 5 (1.3%) patients. In patients >=65 years of age (all randomized population; capecitabine 188 patients, 5-FU/LV 208 patients) treated for  Dukes≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   C≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   colon≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  after  resection≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   of≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   the≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   primary≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   tumor≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , the hazard ratios for disease-free survival and overall survival for XELODA compared to 5-FU/LV were 1.01 (95% C.I. 0.80 - 1.27) and 1.04 (95% C.I. 0.79 - 1.37), respectively.

    5.11 Hepatic Insufficiency

  Patients with mild to moderate  hepatic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   dysfunction≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  due to  liver≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   metastases≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  should be carefully monitored when XELODA is administered. The effect of severe  hepatic≠B-NonOSE_AE   dysfunction≠I-NonOSE_AE  on the disposition of XELODA is not known [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.6)  and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  .

    5.12 Combination With Other Drugs

  Use of XELODA in combination with irinotecan has not been adequately studied.
