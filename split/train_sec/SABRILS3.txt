     5        WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  



   EXCERPT:    *  Permanent vision loss: Baseline and periodic vision assessment is required (  5.1  ) 
 *  Abnormal MRI signal changes have been reported in some infants with IS receiving SABRIL (  5.3  ) 
 *  Suicidal behavior and ideation: Antiepileptic drugs, including SABRIL increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior (  5.5  ) 
 *  Withdrawal of AEDs: Dose should be tapered gradually to avoid withdrawal seizures (  5.6  ) 
 *  Anemia: Monitor for symptoms of anemia (  5.7  ) 
 *  Somnolence and fatigue: Advise patients not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on SABRIL (  5.8  ) 
    
 

    5.1        Vision Loss  



   Because of the risk of  vision≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   loss≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and because, when it is effective, SABRIL provides an observable symptomatic benefit, patient response and continued need for treatment should be periodically assessed.  



  In patients with refractory  complex≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   partial≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   seizures≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , SABRIL should be withdrawn if a substantial clinical benefit is not observed within 3 months of initiating treatment. If, in the clinical judgment of the prescriber, evidence of treatment failure becomes obvious earlier than 3 months, treatment should be discontinued at that time.  



  In patients with  infantile≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   spasms≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , SABRIL should be withdrawn if a substantial clinical benefit is not observed within 2 to 4 weeks. If, in the clinical judgment of the prescriber, evidence of treatment failure becomes obvious earlier than 2 to 4 weeks, treatment should be discontinued at that time [see  BOXED WARNING  ].    



   Monitoring of Vision    



 Monitoring of vision by an ophthalmic professional with expertise in visual field interpretation and the ability to perform dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy of the retina is required, unless a patient is formally exempted from periodic ophthalmologic assessment as documented in the Support, Help And Resources for  Epilepsy≠B-NonOSE_AE  (SHARE) program [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ].  Because vision testing in infants is difficult,  vision≠B-NonOSE_AE   loss≠I-NonOSE_AE  may not be detected until it is severe. For patients receiving SABRIL who are not exempted, vision assessment is required at baseline (no later than 4 weeks after starting SABRIL) and at least every 3 months while on therapy and about 3-6 months after the discontinuation of therapy.



  The diagnostic approach should be individualized for the patient and clinical situation.  For all patients, attempts to monitor vision periodically and/or formal exemptions must be documented under the SHARE program.  In adults and cooperative pediatric patients, perimetry is recommended, preferably by automated threshold visual field testing.  Additional testing may also include electrophysiology (e.g., electroretinography [ERG]), retinal imaging (e.g., optical coherence tomography [OCT]), and/or other methods appropriate for the patient, but this additional testing is not required. In patients exempted from vision testing, treatment may continue according to clinical judgment, with appropriate patient counseling and with documentation in the SHARE program of the exemption.  Because of variability, results from ophthalmic monitoring must be interpreted with caution, and repeat assessment is recommended if results are abnormal or uninterpretable.  Repeat assessment in the first few weeks of treatment is recommended to establish if, and to what degree, reproducible results can be obtained, and to guide selection of appropriate ongoing monitoring for the patient.



 The onset and progression of  vision≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   loss≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  from SABRIL is unpredictable, and it may occur or worsen precipitously between assessments.  Once detected,  vision≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   loss≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  due to SABRIL is not reversible. It is expected that even with frequent monitoring, some SABRIL patients will develop severe  vision≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   loss≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . Drug discontinuation should be considered, balancing benefit and risk, if  visual≠B-NonOSE_AE   loss≠I-NonOSE_AE  is documented.



     5.2        SABRIL SHARE Program  



  SABRIL is available only through a restricted distribution program called the SHARE program, because of the risk of  vision≠B-NonOSE_AE   loss≠I-NonOSE_AE .



 Notable requirements components of the SHARE Program include the following:



 *  *  Assess vision prior to initiating therapy and then every 3 months during therapy. 
 *  Remove patients from SABRIL therapy if the patients do not experience a meaningful reduction in  seizures≠B-Not_AE_Candidate . 
 *  *  The patient is  blind≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  (subsequent Ophthalmologic Assessment Forms do not need to be submitted to the REMS coordinating center) 
 *  The patient's general  neurological≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   and≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  /≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  or≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   mental≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   condition≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  permanently precludes the need for visual assessment (subsequent Ophthalmologic Assessment Forms do not need to be submitted to the REMS coordinating center) 
 *  The patient's general  neurological≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   condition≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  temporarily precludes the ability to assess visual function.  The evaluation, however, may be performed at a later time as clinically appropriate. 
 *  The patient's medical condition prevents visual assessment being performed safely 
 *  For other reasons specified by the prescriber 
   The prescriber may, with appropriate documentation and caregiver counseling, exempt certain patients from vision assessment, using the Ophthalmologic Assessment Form, if: 
   Prescribers must be certified with the program by enrolling and reviewing educational materials and comply with the following: 
 *  Patient/parent/legal guardian must understand the risks and benefits and sign a Patient-Prescriber Agreement. 
 *  Pharmacies that dispense SABRIL must be certified and agree to comply with the REMS requirements.   Certified pharmacies must only dispense SABRIL to patients who are enrolled in the program. 
        5.3        Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Abnormalities in Infants  
 

   Abnormal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   MRI≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   signal≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   changes≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  characterized by  increased≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   T≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  2≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   signal≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  restricted≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   diffusion≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  a symmetric pattern involving the thalamus, basal ganglia, brain stem, and  cerebellum≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been observed in some infants treated with vigabatrin for  infantile≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   spasms≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . In a retrospective epidemiologic study in infants with  IS≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  (N=205), the prevalence of these changes was 22% in vigabatrin treated patients versus 4% in patients treated with other therapies. 



 In the study above, in post marketing experience, and in published literature reports, these changes generally resolved with discontinuation of treatment. In a few patients, the lesion resolved despite continued use.  It has been reported that some infants exhibited coincident  motor≠B-NonOSE_AE   abnormalities≠I-NonOSE_AE , but no causal relationship has been established and the potential for long-term clinical sequelae has not been adequately studied.



  Neurotoxicity≠B-NonOSE_AE  ( brain≠B-NonOSE_AE   histopathology≠I-NonOSE_AE  and neurobehavioral  abnormalities≠I-NonOSE_AE ) was observed in rats exposed to vigabatrin during late gestation and the neonatal and juvenile periods of development.  The relationship between these findings and the  abnormal≠B-NonOSE_AE   MRI≠I-NonOSE_AE   findings≠I-NonOSE_AE  in infants treated with vigabatrin for  infantile≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   spasms≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  is unknown [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.4)  and  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ]  .



 The specific pattern of signal changes observed in  IS≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  patients was not observed in older pediatric and adult patients treated with vigabatrin for  refractory≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   CPS≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . In a blinded review of MRI images obtained in prospective clinical trials in patients with  refractory≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   CPS≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  3 years and older (N=656), no difference was observed in anatomic distribution or prevalence of  MRI≠B-NonOSE_AE   signal≠I-NonOSE_AE   changes≠I-NonOSE_AE  between vigabatrin treated and placebo treated patients.



 For adults treated with SABRIL, routine MRI surveillance is unnecessary as there is no evidence that vigabatrin causes  MRI≠B-NonOSE_AE   changes≠I-NonOSE_AE  in this population.



     5.4        Neurotoxicity  



   Vacuolation≠B-NonOSE_AE , characterized by fluid accumulation and separation  of≠I-NonOSE_AE   the≠I-NonOSE_AE   outer≠I-NonOSE_AE   layers≠I-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   myelin≠I-NonOSE_AE , has been observed  in≠I-NonOSE_AE   brain≠I-NonOSE_AE   white≠I-NonOSE_AE   matter≠I-NonOSE_AE   tracts≠I-NonOSE_AE  in adult and juvenile rats and adult mice, dogs, and possibly monkeys following administration of vigabatrin. This lesion, referred to as  intramyelinic≠B-NonOSE_AE   edema≠I-NonOSE_AE  (IME), was seen in animals at doses within the human therapeutic range. A no-effect dose was not established in rodents or dogs. In the rat and dog,  vacuolation≠B-NonOSE_AE  was reversible following discontinuation of vigabatrin treatment, but, in the rat, pathologic changes consisting of  swollen≠B-NonOSE_AE  or degenerating  axons≠I-NonOSE_AE , m in≠I-NonOSE_AE eralization, and gliosis were seen in  brain≠I-NonOSE_AE  areas in which  vacuolation≠B-NonOSE_AE  had been previously observed.   Vacuolation≠B-NonOSE_AE  in adult animals was correlated with  alterations≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   MRI≠I-NonOSE_AE  and  changes≠B-NonOSE_AE  in visual and  somatosensory≠I-NonOSE_AE   evoked≠I-NonOSE_AE   potentials≠I-NonOSE_AE  (EP).



 Administration of vigabatrin to rats during the neonatal and juvenile periods of development produced  vacuolar≠B-NonOSE_AE   changes≠I-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE  the brain gray matter (areas including the thalamus, midbrain, deep cerebellar nuclei, substantia nigra, hippocampus, and  forebrain≠I-NonOSE_AE ) which are considered distinct from the IME observed in vigabatrin treated adult animals.  Decreased≠B-NonOSE_AE   myelination≠I-NonOSE_AE  and evidence of oligodendrocyte  in≠I-NonOSE_AE jury were additional findings in  the≠I-NonOSE_AE   brains≠I-NonOSE_AE  of vigabatrin-treated rats.  An  increase≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   apoptosis≠I-NonOSE_AE  was seen  in≠I-NonOSE_AE  some  brain≠I-NonOSE_AE  regions following vigabatrin exposure during the early postnatal period.   Long-term  neurobehavioral≠B-NonOSE_AE   abnormalities≠I-NonOSE_AE  ( convulsions≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  neuromotor≠B-NonOSE_AE   impairment≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  learning≠B-NonOSE_AE   deficits≠I-NonOSE_AE ) were also observed following vigabatrin treatment of young rats. These effects in young animals occurred at doses lower than those producing  neurotoxicity≠B-NonOSE_AE  in adult animals and were associated with plasma vigabatrin levels substantially lower than those achieved clinically in infants and children [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ]  .



 In a published study, vigabatrin (200, 400 mg/kg/day) induced  apoptotic≠B-NonOSE_AE   neurodegeneration≠I-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   the≠I-NonOSE_AE   brain≠I-NonOSE_AE  of young rats when administered by intraperitoneal injection on postnatal days 5-7.



 Administration of vigabatrin to female rats during  pregnancy≠B-NonOSE_AE  and lactation at doses below those used clinically resulted in  hippocampal≠B-NonOSE_AE   vacuolation≠I-NonOSE_AE  and convulsions  in≠I-NonOSE_AE  the mature  offspring≠I-NonOSE_AE .



  Abnormal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   MRI≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   signal≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  changes characterized by  in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE creased T2 signal and restricted diffusio n≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   a≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   symmetric≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   patter≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE n involving the  thalamus≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , basal ganglia, brain stem, and  cerebellum≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been observed in some infants treated for  IS≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  with vigabatrin.  Studies of the effects of vigabatrin on MRI and EP in adult  epilepsy≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  patients have demonstrated no clear-cut abnormalities [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  .



     5.5        Suicidal Behavior and Ideation  



  Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including SABRIL, increase the risk of  suicidal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   thoughts≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or  worsening≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   depression≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  suicidal≠B-NonOSE_AE   thoughts≠I-NonOSE_AE  or behavior, and/or any  unusual≠B-NonOSE_AE   changes≠I-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   mood≠I-NonOSE_AE  or behavior.



 Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI: 1.2, 2.7) of  suicidal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   thinking≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of  suicidal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   behavior≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  or ideation among 27,863 AED treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of  suicidal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   thinking≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four  suicides≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  in drug treated patients in the trials and none in placebo treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on  suicide≠B-NonOSE_AE .



 The increased risk of  suicidal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   thoughts≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of  suicidal≠B-NonOSE_AE  thoughts or  behavior≠I-NonOSE_AE  beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.



 The risk of  suicidal≠B-NonOSE_AE  thoughts or  behavior≠I-NonOSE_AE  was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5-100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 4 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.

   Epilepsy≠B-Not_AE_Candidate          1.0              3.4              3.5              2.4              
   Psychiatric≠B-Not_AE_Candidate       5.7              8.5              1.5              2.9              
  Other            1.0              1.8              1.9              0.9              
  Total            2.4              4.3              1.8              1.9              
           The relative risk for  suicidal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   thoughts≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  or behavior was higher in clinical trials for  epilepsy≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the  epilepsy≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and  psychiatric≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  indications.
 

 Anyone considering prescribing SABRIL or any other AED must balance the risk of  suicidal≠B-NonOSE_AE   thoughts≠I-NonOSE_AE  or behavior with the risk of untreated illness.  Epilepsy≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and  mortality≠B-NonOSE_AE  and an increased risk of  suicidal≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   thoughts≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and behavior. Should  suicidal≠B-NonOSE_AE   thoughts≠I-NonOSE_AE  and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.



 Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of  suicidal≠B-NonOSE_AE   thoughts≠I-NonOSE_AE  and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or  worsening≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   the≠I-NonOSE_AE   signs≠I-NonOSE_AE   and≠I-NonOSE_AE   symptoms≠I-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   depression≠I-NonOSE_AE , any  unusual≠B-NonOSE_AE   changes≠I-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   mood≠I-NonOSE_AE  or behavior, or the emergence of  suicidal≠B-NonOSE_AE   thoughts≠I-NonOSE_AE , behavior, or  thoughts≠B-NonOSE_AE   about≠I-NonOSE_AE   self≠I-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  harm≠I-NonOSE_AE . Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.



     5.6        Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs)  



  As with all AEDs, SABRIL should be withdrawn gradually. Patients and caregivers should be told not to suddenly discontinue SABRIL therapy.



 In controlled clinical studies in adults with  complex≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   partial≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   seizures≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , SABRIL was tapered by decreasing the daily dose 1000 mg/day on a weekly basis until discontinued.



 In a controlled study in pediatric patients with  complex≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   partial≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   seizures≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , SABRIL was tapered by decreasing the daily dose by one third every week for three weeks.



 In a controlled clinical study in patients with  infantile≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   spasms≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , SABRIL was tapered by decreasing the daily dose at a rate of 25-50 mg/kg every 3-4 days [see  Dosage and Administration (2.1)  ].  



     5.7        Anemia  



  In North American controlled trials in adults, 6% of patients (16/280) receiving SABRIL and 2% of patients (3/188) receiving placebo had adverse events of  anemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and/or met criteria for potentially clinically important  hematology≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   changes≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  involving hemoglobin, hematocrit, and/or RBC indices.  Across U.S. controlled trials, there were mean  decreases≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   hemoglobin≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  of about 3% and 0% in SABRIL and placebo treated patients, respectively, and a mean  decrease≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   hematocrit≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  of about 1% in SABRIL treated patients compared to a mean gain of about 1% in patients treated with placebo.



 In controlled and open label  epilepsy≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  trials in adults and pediatric patients, 3 SABRIL patients (0.06%, 3/4855) discontinued for  anemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and 2 SABRIL patients experienced unexplained  declines≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   hemoglobin≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  to below 8 g/dL and/or hematocrit below 24%.



     5.8        Somnolence and Fatigue  



  SABRIL causes  somnolence≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  fatigue≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . Patients should be advised not to drive a car or operate other complex machinery until they are familiar with the effects of SABRIL on their ability to perform such activities.



 Pooled data from two SABRIL controlled trials in adults demonstrated that 24% (54/222) of SABRIL patients experienced  somnolence≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  compared to 10% (14/135) of placebo patients. In those same studies, 28% of SABRIL patients experienced  fatigue≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  compared to 15% (20/135) of placebo patients. Almost 1% of SABRIL patients discontinued from clinical trials for  somnolence≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and almost 1% discontinued for  fatigue≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .



  Pooled data from three SABRIL controlled trials in pediatric patients demonstrated that 6% (10/165) of SABRIL patients experienced  somnolence≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  compared to 5% (5/104) of placebo patients. In those same studies, 10% (17/165) of SABRIL patients experienced  fatigue≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  compared to 7% (7/104) of placebo patients. No SABRIL patients discontinued from clinical trials due to  somnolence≠B-NonOSE_AE  or  fatigue≠B-NonOSE_AE .  



     5.9        Peripheral Neuropathy  



  SABRIL causes symptoms of  peripheral≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   neuropathy≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  in adults. Pediatric clinical trials were not designed to assess symptoms of  peripheral≠B-NonOSE_AE   neuropathy≠I-NonOSE_AE , but observed incidence of symptoms based on pooled data from controlled pediatric studies appeared similar for pediatric patients on vigabatrin and placebo. In a pool of North American controlled and uncontrolled  epilepsy≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  studies, 4.2% (19/457) of SABRIL patients developed signs and/or symptoms of  peripheral≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   neuropathy≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . In the subset of North American placebo-controlled epilepsy trials, 1.4% (4/280) of SABRIL treated patients and no (0/188) placebo patients developed signs and/or symptoms of  peripheral≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   neuropathy≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . Initial manifestations of  peripheral≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   neuropathy≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  in these trials included, in some combination, symptoms of  numbness≠B-NonOSE_AE  or tingling in the  toes≠I-NonOSE_AE  or feet, signs of  reduced≠B-NonOSE_AE   distal≠I-NonOSE_AE   lower≠I-NonOSE_AE   limb≠I-NonOSE_AE   vibration≠I-NonOSE_AE  or position sensation, or  progressive≠B-NonOSE_AE   loss≠I-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   reflexes≠I-NonOSE_AE , starting at the ankles. Clinical studies in the development program were not designed to investigate  peripheral≠B-NonOSE_AE   neuropathy≠I-NonOSE_AE  systematically and did not include nerve conduction studies, quantitative sensory testing, or skin or nerve biopsy. There is insufficient evidence to determine if development of these signs and symptoms were related to duration of SABRIL treatment, cumulative dose, or if the findings of  peripheral≠B-NonOSE_AE   neuropathy≠I-NonOSE_AE  were completely reversible upon discontinuation of SABRIL.



     5.10        Weight Gain  



  SABRIL causes  weight≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   gain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  in adult and pediatric patients.



 Data pooled from randomized controlled trials in adults found that 17% (77/443) of SABRIL patients versus 8% (22/275) of placebo patients  gained≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  >=7% of baseline body  weight≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . In these same trials, the mean weight change among SABRIL patients was 3.5 kg compared to 1.6 kg for placebo patients.



  Data pooled from randomized controlled trials in pediatric patients with refractory  complex≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   partial≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   seizures≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  found that 47% (77/163) of SABRIL patients versus 19% (19/102) of placebo patients  gained≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  >=7% of baseline body  weight≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE .  



  In all  epilepsy≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  trials, 0.6% (31/4855) of SABRIL patients discontinued for  weight≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   gain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . The long term effects of SABRIL related  weight≠B-NonOSE_AE   gain≠I-NonOSE_AE  are not known.  Weight≠B-NonOSE_AE   gain≠I-NonOSE_AE  was not related to the occurrence of  edema≠B-NonOSE_AE .  



     5.11        Edema  



  SABRIL causes  edema≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  in adults.  Pediatric clinical trials were not designed to assess  edema≠B-NonOSE_AE , but observed incidence of  edema≠B-NonOSE_AE  based pooled data from controlled pediatric studies appeared similar for pediatric patients on vigabatrin and placebo.



 Pooled data from controlled trials demonstrated increased risk among SABRIL patients compared to placebo patients for  peripheral≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   edema≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (SABRIL 2%, placebo 1%), and  edema≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (SABRIL 1%, placebo 0%). In these studies, one SABRIL and no placebo patients discontinued for an  edema≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  related AE. In adults, there was no apparent association between  edema≠B-NonOSE_AE  and  cardiovascular≠B-NonOSE_AE   adverse≠I-NonOSE_AE   events≠I-NonOSE_AE  such as  hypertension≠B-NonOSE_AE  or  congestive≠B-NonOSE_AE   heart≠I-NonOSE_AE   failure≠I-NonOSE_AE .  Edema≠B-NonOSE_AE  was not associated with  laboratory≠B-NonOSE_AE   changes≠I-NonOSE_AE  suggestive of  deterioration≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE  renal or  hepatic≠I-NonOSE_AE   function≠I-NonOSE_AE .
