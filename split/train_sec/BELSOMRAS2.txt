    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Daytime somnolence: Risk of impaired alertness and motor coordination, including impaired driving; risk increases with dose; caution patients taking 20 mg against next-day driving and other activities requiring complete mental alertness (  5.1  ). 
 *  Need to evaluate for co-morbid diagnoses: Reevaluate if insomnia persists after 7 to 10 days of treatment (  5.2  ). 
 *  Nighttime "sleep-driving" and other complex behaviors while out of bed and not fully awake. Risk increases with dose, with use of CNS depressants, and with alcohol (  5.3  ). 
 *  Depression: Worsening of depression or suicidal thinking may occur. Risk increases with dose. Immediately evaluate any new behavioral changes (  5.4  ). 
 *  Compromised respiratory function: Effect on respiratory function should be considered (  5.5  ,  8.6  ). 
 *  Sleep paralysis, hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, and cataplexy-like symptoms: Risk increases with dose (  5.6  ). 
    
 

   5.1 CNS Depressant Effects and Daytime Impairment



  BELSOMRA is a central nervous system (CNS) depressant that can  impair≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   daytime≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   wakefulness≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  even when used as prescribed. Prescribers should monitor for  somnolence≠B-NonOSE_AE  and  CNS≠B-NonOSE_AE   depressant≠I-NonOSE_AE   effects≠I-NonOSE_AE , but impairment can occur in the absence of symptoms, and may not be reliably detected by ordinary clinical exam (i.e., less than formal testing of daytime wakefulness and/or psychomotor performance).  CNS≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   depressant≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   effects≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  may persist in some patients for up to several days after discontinuing BELSOMRA.



 BELSOMRA can  impair≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   driving≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   skills≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and may  increase≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   the≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   risk≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   falling≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   asleep≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   while≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   driving≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . Discontinue or decrease the dose in patients who drive if  daytime≠B-NonOSE_AE   somnolence≠I-NonOSE_AE  develops. In a study of healthy adults,  driving≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   ability≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   was≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   impaired≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  in some individuals taking 20 mg BELSOMRA [see  Clinical Studies (14.2)  ].  Although pharmacodynamic tolerance or adaptation to some adverse depressant effects of BELSOMRA may develop with daily use, patients using the 20 mg dose of BELSOMRA should be cautioned against next-day driving and other activities requiring full mental alertness. Patients taking lower doses of BELSOMRA should also be cautioned about the potential for  driving≠B-NonOSE_AE   impairment≠I-NonOSE_AE  because there is individual variation in sensitivity to BELSOMRA.



 Co-administration with other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, alcohol)  increases≠B-NonOSE_AE   the≠I-NonOSE_AE   risk≠I-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   CNS≠I-NonOSE_AE   depression≠I-NonOSE_AE . Patients should be advised not to consume alcohol in combination with BELSOMRA because of additive effects [see  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ]  . Dosage adjustments of BELSOMRA and of concomitant CNS depressants may be necessary when administered together because of potentially additive effects. The use of BELSOMRA with other drugs to treat  insomnia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  is not recommended [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ].  



 The risk of  next≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  day≠I-NonOSE_AE   impairment≠I-NonOSE_AE , including  impaired≠B-NonOSE_AE   driving≠I-NonOSE_AE , is increased if BELSOMRA is taken with less than a full night of sleep remaining, if a higher than the recommended dose is taken, if co-administered with other CNS depressants, or if co-administered with other drugs that increase blood levels of BELSOMRA. Patients should be cautioned against driving and other activities requiring complete mental alertness if BELSOMRA is taken in these circumstances.



    5.2 Need to Evaluate for Co-morbid Diagnoses



  Because  sleep≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disturbances≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  may be the presenting manifestation of a  physical≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and/or psychiatric  disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , treatment of  insomnia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  should be initiated only after careful evaluation of the patient. The failure of  insomnia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  to remit after 7 to 10 days of treatment may indicate the presence of a primary  psychiatric≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and/or medical  illness≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  that should be evaluated.  Worsening≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   of≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   insomnia≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  or the emergence of new  cognitive≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or behavioral  abnormalities≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  may be the result of an unrecognized underlying  psychiatric≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or physical  disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , and can emerge during the course of treatment with hypnotic drugs such as BELSOMRA.



    5.3 Abnormal Thinking and Behavioral Changes



  A variety of  cognitive≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and behavioral  changes≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (e.g.,  amnesia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  anxiety≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  hallucinations≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and other  neuro≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  psychiatric≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   symptoms≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ) have been reported to occur in association with the use of hypnotics such as BELSOMRA.  Complex≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   behaviors≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  such as  "≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  sleep≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  driving≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  "≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (i.e.,  driving≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   while≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   not≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   fully≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   awake≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  after taking a hypnotic) and other  complex≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   behaviors≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (e.g.,  preparing≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   and≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   eating≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   food≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , making phone calls, or having sex),  with≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   amnesia≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   for≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   the≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   event≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , have been reported in association with the use of hypnotics. These events can occur in hypnotic-naive as well as in hypnotic-experienced persons. The use of alcohol and other CNS depressants may increase the risk of such behaviors. Discontinuation of BELSOMRA should be strongly considered for patients who report any  complex≠B-NonOSE_AE   sleep≠I-NonOSE_AE   behavior≠I-NonOSE_AE .



    5.4 Worsening of Depression/Suicidal Ideation



  In clinical studies, a dose-dependent  increase≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   suicidal≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   ideation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  was observed in patients taking BELSOMRA as assessed by questionnaire. Immediately evaluate patients with  suicidal≠B-NonOSE_AE   ideation≠I-NonOSE_AE  or any new behavioral sign or symptom.



 In primarily  depressed≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  patients treated with sedative-hypnotics,  worsening≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   depression≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  suicidal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   thoughts≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and actions (including  completed≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   suicides≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ) have been reported.  Suicidal≠B-NonOSE_AE   tendencies≠I-NonOSE_AE  may be present in such patients and protective measures may be required.  Intentional≠B-NonOSE_AE   overdose≠I-NonOSE_AE  is more common in this group of patients; therefore, the lowest number of tablets that is feasible should be prescribed for the patient at any one time.



 The emergence of any new  behavioral≠B-NonOSE_AE   sign≠I-NonOSE_AE   or≠I-NonOSE_AE   symptom≠I-NonOSE_AE  of concern requires careful and immediate evaluation.



    5.5 Patients with Compromised Respiratory Function



  Effect of BELSOMRA on respiratory function should be considered if prescribed to patients with  compromised≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   respiratory≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   function≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . BELSOMRA has not been studied in patients with severe  obstructive≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   sleep≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   apnea≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  (OSA) or severe  chronic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   obstructive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   pulmonary≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  (COPD) [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.6)  ].  



    5.6 Sleep Paralysis, Hypnagogic/Hypnopompic Hallucinations, Cataplexy-like Symptoms



   Sleep≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   paralysis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , an  inability≠B-NonOSE_AE   to≠I-NonOSE_AE   move≠I-NonOSE_AE   or≠I-NonOSE_AE   speak≠I-NonOSE_AE   for≠I-NonOSE_AE   up≠I-NonOSE_AE   to≠I-NonOSE_AE   several≠I-NonOSE_AE   minutes≠I-NonOSE_AE   during≠I-NonOSE_AE   sleep≠I-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  wake≠I-NonOSE_AE   transitions≠I-NonOSE_AE , and  hypnagogic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE /hypnopompic  hallucinations≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , including  vivid≠B-NonOSE_AE  and disturbing  perceptions≠I-NonOSE_AE  by the patient, can occur with the use of BELSOMRA. Prescribers should explain the nature of these events to patients when prescribing BELSOMRA.



  Symptoms≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   similar≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   to≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   mild≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   cataplexy≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  can occur, with risk increasing with the dose of BELSOMRA. Such symptoms can include periods of  leg≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   weakness≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  lasting from seconds to a few minutes, can occur both at night and during the day, and may not be associated with an identified triggering event (e.g., laughter or surprise).
