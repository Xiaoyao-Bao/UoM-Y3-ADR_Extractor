    5         WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  

     EXCERPT:    *   Hypocalcemia  : Life threatening events and fatal outcomes were reported. Hypocalcemia can prolong QT interval, lower the threshold for seizures, and cause hypotension, worsening heart failure, and/or arrhythmia.  Monitor serum calcium carefully for the occurrence of hypocalcemia during treatment (  2.4  ,  5.1  ) 
 *   Upper Gastrointestinal (GI) Bleeding: Patients with risk factors for upper GI bleeding may be at increased risk. Monitor patients and promptly evaluate and treat any suspected GI bleeding. (  5.2  ) 
 *   Hypotension, Worsening Heart Failure and/or Arrhythmias : In postmarketing safety surveillance, isolated, idiosyncratic cases of hypotension, worsening heart failure, and/or arrhythmia have been reported in patients with impaired cardiac function. (  5.3  ) 
 *   Adynamic  B  one  D  isease : May develop if iPTH levels are suppressed below 100 pg/mL. (  5.4  ) 
    
 

   5.1       Hypocalcemia

   Sensipar  lowers≠B-NonOSE_AE   serum≠I-NonOSE_AE   calcium≠I-NonOSE_AE  and can lead to  hypocalcemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  [see Adverse Reactions (     6.1     )].  Significant  lowering≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   serum≠I-NonOSE_AE   calcium≠I-NonOSE_AE  can cause  paresthesias≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  myalgias≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  muscle≠B-NonOSE_AE   spasms≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  tetany≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  seizures≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  QT≠B-NonOSE_AE   interval≠I-NonOSE_AE   prolongation≠I-NonOSE_AE  and  ventricular≠B-NonOSE_AE   arrhythmia≠I-NonOSE_AE . Life threatening events and  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE  outcomes associated with  hypocalcemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported in patients treated with Sensipar, including in pediatric patients. The safety and effectiveness of Sensipar have not been established in pediatric patients  [see Pediatric Use (     8.4     )].    

 Sensipar is not indicated for patients with  CKD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  not on dialysis  [see   I   ndications and Usage (     1     )]  .  In patients with  secondary≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   HPT≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and  CKD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  not on dialysis, the long term safety and efficacy of Sensipar have not been established.  Clinical studies indicate that Sensipar-treated patients with  CKD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  not on dialysis have an increased risk for  hypocalcemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  compared with Sensipar-treated patients with  CKD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  on dialysis, which may be due to lower baseline calcium levels.  In a phase 3 study of 32 weeks duration and including 404 patients with  CKD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  not on dialysis (302 cinacalcet, 102 placebo), in which the median dose for cinacalcet was 60 mg per day at the completion of the study, 80% of Sensipar-treated patients experienced at least one  serum≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   calcium≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   value≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   <≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   8≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  .≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  4≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   mg≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  /≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  dL≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  compared with 5% of patients receiving placebo.

  QT Interval Prolongation and Ventricular Arrhythmia  

   Decreases≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   serum≠I-NonOSE_AE   calcium≠I-NonOSE_AE  can also  prolong≠B-NonOSE_AE   the≠I-NonOSE_AE   QT≠I-NonOSE_AE   interval≠I-NonOSE_AE , potentially resulting in  ventricular≠B-NonOSE_AE   arrhythmia≠I-NonOSE_AE . Cases of  QT≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   prolongation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  ventricular≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   arrhythmia≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported in patients treated with Sensipar. Patients with  congenital≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   long≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   QT≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   syndrome≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , history of  QT≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   interval≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   prolongation≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , family history of  long≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   QT≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   syndrome≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  or  sudden≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   cardiac≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   death≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , and other conditions that predispose to  QT≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   interval≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   prolongation≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and  ventricular≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   arrhythmia≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  may be at increased risk for  QT≠B-NonOSE_AE   interval≠I-NonOSE_AE   prolongation≠I-NonOSE_AE  and  ventricular≠B-NonOSE_AE   arrhythmias≠I-NonOSE_AE  if they develop  hypocalcemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  due to Sensipar. Closely monitor corrected serum calcium and QT interval in patients at risk receiving Sensipar.  

  Seizures  

 In clinical studies,  seizures≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (primarily generalized or tonic-clonic) were observed in 1.4% (43/3049) of Sensipar-treated patients and 0.7% (5/687) of placebo-treated patients. While the basis for the reported difference in  seizure≠B-NonOSE_AE  rate is not clear, the  threshold≠B-NonOSE_AE   for≠I-NonOSE_AE   seizures≠I-NonOSE_AE   is≠I-NonOSE_AE   lowered≠I-NonOSE_AE  by significant  reductions≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   serum≠I-NonOSE_AE   calcium≠I-NonOSE_AE   levels≠I-NonOSE_AE . Monitor serum calcium levels in patients with  seizure≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorders≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  receiving Sensipar .  

  Concurrent administration of Sensipar with  calcium≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  lowering≠I-NonOSE_AE   drugs≠I-NonOSE_AE  including other calcium-sensing receptor agonists could result in  severe≠B-NonOSE_AE   hypocalcemia≠I-NonOSE_AE . Closely monitor serum calcium in patients receiving Sensipar and concomitant therapies known to  lower≠B-NonOSE_AE   serum≠I-NonOSE_AE   calcium≠I-NonOSE_AE   levels≠I-NonOSE_AE .  

  Educate patients on the symptoms of  hypocalcemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  and advise them to contact a healthcare provider if they occur.  

  If  corrected≠B-NonOSE_AE   serum≠I-NonOSE_AE   calcium≠I-NonOSE_AE   falls≠I-NonOSE_AE   below≠I-NonOSE_AE   the≠I-NonOSE_AE   lower≠I-NonOSE_AE   limit≠I-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   normal≠I-NonOSE_AE  or symptoms of  hypocalcemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  develop, start or  increase≠B-NonOSE_AE   calcium≠I-NonOSE_AE   supplementation≠I-NonOSE_AE  (including calcium, calcium-containing phosphate binders, and/or vitamin D sterols or increases in dialysate calcium concentration). Sensipar dose reduction or discontinuation of Sensipar may be necessary [see Dosage and Administration (     2.2     )].    

    5.2       Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding

   Cases of  gastrointestinal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   bleeding≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , mostly  upper≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   gastrointestinal≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   bleeding≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , have occurred in patients using calcimimetics, including Sensipar, from postmarketing and clinical trial sources. The exact cause of GI bleeding in these patients is unknown.  

    

  Patients with risk factors for  upper≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   GI≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   bleeding≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  (such as known  gastritis≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ,  esophagitis≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ,  ulcers≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or severe  vomiting≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ) may be at increased risk for  GI≠B-NonOSE_AE   bleeding≠I-NonOSE_AE  when receiving Sensipar treatment. Monitor patients for worsening of common  GI≠B-NonOSE_AE   adverse≠I-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE  of  nausea≠B-NonOSE_AE  and  vomiting≠B-NonOSE_AE  associated with Sensipar [see Adverse Reactions (     6.1     )]  and for signs and symptoms of  GI≠B-NonOSE_AE   bleeding≠I-NonOSE_AE  and  ulcerations≠B-NonOSE_AE  during Sensipar therapy. Promptly evaluate and treat any suspected  GI≠B-NonOSE_AE   bleeding≠I-NonOSE_AE .  

    5.3        Hypotension, Worsening Heart Failure and/or Arrhythmias

   In postmarketing safety surveillance, isolated, idiosyncratic cases of  hypotension≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  worsening≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   heart≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   failure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and/or  arrhythmia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported in patients with  impaired≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   cardiac≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   function≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , in which a causal relationship to Sensipar could not be completely excluded and which may be mediated by  reductions≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   serum≠I-NonOSE_AE   calcium≠I-NonOSE_AE   levels≠I-NonOSE_AE  [see Adverse Reactions       (     6.2     )].    

    5.4             Adynamic Bone Disease

   Adynamic≠B-NonOSE_AE   bone≠I-NonOSE_AE   disease≠I-NonOSE_AE  may develop if  iPTH≠B-NonOSE_AE   levels≠I-NonOSE_AE   are≠I-NonOSE_AE   suppressed≠I-NonOSE_AE   below≠I-NonOSE_AE   1≠I-NonOSE_AE  0≠I-NonOSE_AE  0≠I-NonOSE_AE   pg≠I-NonOSE_AE  /≠I-NonOSE_AE  mL≠I-NonOSE_AE . One clinical study evaluated bone histomorphometry in patients treated with Sensipar for 1 year. Three patients with mild  hyperparathyroid≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   bone≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  at the beginning of the study developed  adynamic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   bone≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   disease≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  during treatment with Sensipar. Two of these patients had  iPTH≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   levels≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   below≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   1≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  0≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  0≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   pg≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  /≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  mL≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  at multiple time points during the study. In three 6-month, phase 3 studies conducted in patients with  CKD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  on dialysis, 11% of patients treated with Sensipar had mean  iPTH≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   values≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   below≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   1≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  0≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  0≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   pg≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  /≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  mL≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  during the efficacy-assessment phase. If  iPTH≠B-NonOSE_AE   levels≠I-NonOSE_AE   decrease≠I-NonOSE_AE  below 150 pg/mL in patients treated with Sensipar, the dose of Sensipar and/or vitamin D sterols should be reduced or therapy discontinued.
