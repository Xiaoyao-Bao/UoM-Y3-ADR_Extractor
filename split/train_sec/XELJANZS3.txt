   5.1 Serious Infections



   Serious and sometimes fatal  infections≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  due to  bacterial≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, or other  opportunistic≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  pathogens have been reported in  rheumatoid≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   arthritis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  patients receiving XELJANZ. The most common serious  infections≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  reported with XELJANZ included  pneumonia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  cellulitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  herpes≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   zoster≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  urinary≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   tract≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infection≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  diverticulitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Among  opportunistic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   infections≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  tuberculosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and other  mycobacterial≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   infections≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  cryptococcosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  esophageal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   candidiasis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  pneumocystosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  multidermatomal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   herpes≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   zoster≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  cytomegalovirus≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  BK≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   virus≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  were reported with XELJANZ. Some patients have presented with disseminated rather than localized disease, and were often taking concomitant immunomodulating agents such as methotrexate or corticosteroids.  



 Other serious  infections≠B-NonOSE_AE  that were not reported in clinical studies may also occur (e.g.,  histoplasmosis≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  coccidioidomycosis≠B-NonOSE_AE , and  listeriosis≠B-NonOSE_AE ).



 Avoid use of XELJANZ in patients with an active, serious  infection≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , including  localized≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   infections≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . The risks and benefits of treatment should be considered prior to initiating XELJANZ in patients:



 *  with  chronic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or recurrent  infection≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  
 *  who have been  exposed≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   to≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   tuberculosis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  
 *  with a history of a serious or an  opportunistic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   infection≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  
 *  who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic  tuberculosis≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or endemic  mycoses≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ; or 
 *  with underlying conditions that may  predispose≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  them  to≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   infection≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . 
    Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of  infection≠B-NonOSE_AE  during and after treatment with XELJANZ. XELJANZ should be interrupted if a patient develops a serious  infection≠B-NonOSE_AE , an  opportunistic≠B-NonOSE_AE   infection≠I-NonOSE_AE , or  sepsis≠B-NonOSE_AE . A patient who develops a new  infection≠B-NonOSE_AE  during treatment with XELJANZ should undergo prompt and complete diagnostic testing appropriate for an  immunocompromised≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   patient≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ; appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be initiated, and the patient should be closely monitored.
 

    Tuberculosis  



 Patients should be evaluated and tested for latent or active  infection≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  prior to administration of XELJANZ.



  Anti≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  tuberculosis≠I-NonOSE_AE   therapy≠I-NonOSE_AE  should also be considered prior to administration of XELJANZ in patients with a past history of  latent≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or active  tuberculosis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for  latent≠B-NonOSE_AE   tuberculosis≠I-NonOSE_AE  but who have risk factors for  tuberculosis≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   infection≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of  tuberculosis≠B-NonOSE_AE  is recommended to aid in the decision about whether initiating  anti≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  tuberculosis≠I-NonOSE_AE   therapy≠I-NonOSE_AE  is appropriate for an individual patient.



 Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of  tuberculosis≠B-NonOSE_AE , including patients who tested negative for  latent≠B-NonOSE_AE   tuberculosis≠I-NonOSE_AE   infection≠I-NonOSE_AE  prior to initiating therapy.



 Patients with  latent≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   tuberculosis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  should be treated with standard antimycobacterial therapy before administering XELJANZ.



    Viral Reactivation  



   Viral≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactivation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , including cases of  herpes≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   virus≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactivation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (e.g.,  herpes≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   zoster≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ), were observed in clinical studies with XELJANZ. The impact of XELJANZ on chronic  viral≠B-NonOSE_AE   hepatitis≠I-NonOSE_AE   reactivation≠I-NonOSE_AE  is unknown. Patients who screened positive for  hepatitis≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   B≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  or C were excluded from clinical trials. Screening for  viral≠B-NonOSE_AE   hepatitis≠I-NonOSE_AE  should be performed in accordance with clinical guidelines before starting therapy with XELJANZ. The risk of  herpes≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   zoster≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  is increased in patients treated with XELJANZ and appears to be higher in patients treated with XELJANZ in Japan.  



    5.2 Malignancy and Lymphoproliferative Disorders



  Consider the risks and benefits of XELJANZ treatment prior to initiating therapy in patients with a known  malignancy≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  other than a successfully treated  non≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  melanoma≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   skin≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   (≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  NMSC≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ) or when considering continuing XELJANZ in patients who develop a  malignancy≠B-NonOSE_AE .  Malignancies≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  were observed in clinical studies of XELJANZ [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  



 In the seven controlled  rheumatoid≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   arthritis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  clinical studies, 11  solid≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   cancers≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and one  lymphoma≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  were diagnosed in 3328 patients receiving XELJANZ with or without DMARD, compared to 0  solid≠B-NonOSE_AE   cancers≠I-NonOSE_AE  and 0  lymphomas≠B-NonOSE_AE  in 809 patients in the placebo with or without DMARD group during the first 12 months of exposure.  Lymphomas≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  solid≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   cancers≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  have also been observed in the long-term extension studies in  rheumatoid≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   arthritis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  patients treated with XELJANZ.



 In Phase 2B, controlled dose-ranging trials in de-novo   renal≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   transplant≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  patients, all of whom received induction therapy with basiliximab, high-dose corticosteroids, and mycophenolic acid products,  Epstein≠B-NonOSE_AE   Barr≠I-NonOSE_AE   Virus≠I-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  associated≠I-NonOSE_AE  post-transplant  lymphoproliferative≠I-NonOSE_AE   disorder≠I-NonOSE_AE  was observed in 5 out of 218 patients treated with XELJANZ (2.3%) compared to 0 out of 111 patients treated with cyclosporine.



    Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer  



  Non≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  melanoma≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   skin≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   cancers≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  NMSCs≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ) have been reported in patients treated with XELJANZ. Periodic skin examination is recommended for patients who are at increased risk for  skin≠B-NonOSE_AE   cancer≠I-NonOSE_AE .



    5.3 Gastrointestinal Perforations



  Events of  gastrointestinal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   perforation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported in clinical studies with XELJANZ in  rheumatoid≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   arthritis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  patients, although the role of  JAK≠B-NonOSE_AE   inhibition≠I-NonOSE_AE  in these events is not known.



 XELJANZ should be used with caution in patients who may be at increased risk for  gastrointestinal≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   perforation≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  (e.g., patients with a history of  diverticulitis≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ). Patients presenting with new onset  abdominal≠B-NonOSE_AE   symptoms≠I-NonOSE_AE  should be evaluated promptly for early identification of  gastrointestinal≠B-NonOSE_AE   perforation≠I-NonOSE_AE  [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  



    5.4 Laboratory Abnormalities



   Lymphocyte Abnormalities  



 Treatment with XELJANZ was associated with initial  lymphocytosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  at one month of exposure followed by a gradual  decrease≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   mean≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   absolute≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   lymphocyte≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   counts≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  below the baseline of approximately 10% during 12 months of therapy.  Lymphocyte≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   counts≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   less≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   than≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   5≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  0≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  0≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   cells≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  /≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  mm≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE    3≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   were associated with an increased incidence of treated and serious  infections≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .



 Avoid initiation of XELJANZ treatment in patients with a  low≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   lymphocyte≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   count≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  (i.e., less than 500 cells/mm  3  ). In patients who develop a confirmed  absolute≠B-NonOSE_AE   lymphocyte≠I-NonOSE_AE   count≠I-NonOSE_AE   less≠I-NonOSE_AE   than≠I-NonOSE_AE   5≠I-NonOSE_AE  0≠I-NonOSE_AE  0≠I-NonOSE_AE   cells≠I-NonOSE_AE  /≠I-NonOSE_AE  mm≠I-NonOSE_AE    3≠I-NonOSE_AE   treatment with XELJANZ is not recommended.



 Monitor lymphocyte counts at baseline and every 3 months thereafter. For recommended modifications based on lymphocyte counts see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)    .



    Neutropenia  



 Treatment with XELJANZ was associated with an increased incidence of  neutropenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (less than 2000 cells/mm  3  ) compared to placebo.



 Avoid initiation of XELJANZ treatment in patients with a  low≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   neutrophil≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   count≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  (i.e.,  ANC≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   less≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   than≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   1≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  0≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  0≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  0≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   cells≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  /≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  mm≠I-Not_AE_Candidate    3≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   ). For patients who develop a  persistent≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   ANC≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   5≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  0≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  0≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  1≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  0≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  0≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  0≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   cells≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  /≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  mm≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE    3≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   , interrupt XELJANZ dosing until ANC is greater than or equal to 1000 cells/mm  3  . In patients who develop an  ANC≠B-NonOSE_AE   less≠I-NonOSE_AE   than≠I-NonOSE_AE   5≠I-NonOSE_AE  0≠I-NonOSE_AE  0≠I-NonOSE_AE   cells≠I-NonOSE_AE  /≠I-NonOSE_AE  mm≠I-NonOSE_AE   3  , treatment with XELJANZ is not recommended.



 Monitor neutrophil counts at baseline and after 4-8 weeks of treatment and every 3 months thereafter. For recommended modifications based on ANC results see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)    .



     Anemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   



 Avoid initiation of XELJANZ treatment in patients with a  low≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   hemoglobin≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   level≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  (i.e. less than 9 g/dL). Treatment with XELJANZ should be interrupted in patients who develop  hemoglobin≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   levels≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   less≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   than≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   8≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   g≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  /≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  dL≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  or whose  hemoglobin≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   level≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   drops≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  greater than 2 g/dL on treatment.



 Monitor hemoglobin at baseline and after 4-8 weeks of treatment and every 3 months thereafter. For recommended modifications based on hemoglobin results see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)    .



    Liver Enzyme Elevations  



 Treatment with XELJANZ was associated with an increased incidence of  liver≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   enzyme≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   elevation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  compared to placebo. Most of these abnormalities occurred in studies with background DMARD (primarily methotrexate) therapy.



 Routine monitoring of liver tests and prompt investigation of the causes of  liver≠B-NonOSE_AE   enzyme≠I-NonOSE_AE   elevations≠I-NonOSE_AE  is recommended to identify potential cases of  drug≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  induced≠I-NonOSE_AE   liver≠I-NonOSE_AE   injury≠I-NonOSE_AE . If  drug≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  induced≠I-NonOSE_AE   liver≠I-NonOSE_AE   injury≠I-NonOSE_AE  is suspected, the administration of XELJANZ should be interrupted until this diagnosis has been excluded.



    Lipid Elevations  



 Treatment with XELJANZ was associated with  increases≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  in lipid parameters including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and  high≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  density≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   lipoprotein≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  HDL≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  )≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   cholesterol≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . Maximum effects were generally observed within 6 weeks. The effect of these  lipid≠B-NonOSE_AE   parameter≠I-NonOSE_AE   elevations≠I-NonOSE_AE  on cardiovascular morbidity and  mortality≠B-NonOSE_AE  has not been determined.



 Assessment of lipid parameters should be performed approximately 4-8 weeks following initiation of XELJANZ therapy.



 Manage patients according to clinical guidelines [e.g., National Cholesterol Educational Program (NCEP)] for the management of  hyperlipidemia≠B-NonOSE_AE .



    5.5 Vaccinations



  No data are available on the response to vaccination or on the  secondary≠B-NonOSE_AE   transmission≠I-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   infection≠I-NonOSE_AE   by≠I-NonOSE_AE   live≠I-NonOSE_AE   vaccines≠I-NonOSE_AE  to patients receiving XELJANZ. Avoid use of live vaccines concurrently with XELJANZ.



 Update immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating XELJANZ therapy.
