    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *    Embryo-Fetal Toxicity. Do not use in pregnant women. Obtain a urine or serum pregnancy test prior to initiation of therapy. Advise use of effective contraception in females of reproductive potential (  Boxed Warning  ,  5.1  ,  8.1  ,  8.8  ,  13.1  ). 
 *    Reproductive effects. Miltefosine caused testicular atrophy and impaired fertility in male rats and impaired fertility in female rats. Advise patients of reproductive toxicities in animal studies and that the potential effects on human fertility have not been adequately evaluated (  13.1  ). 
 *    Renal Effects. Monitor serum creatinine during therapy and for 4 weeks after end of therapy (  5.3  ,  6.1  ). 
 *    Hepatic Effects. Monitor transaminases and bilirubin during therapy (  5.4  ,  6.1  ). 
 *    Gastrointestinal Effects. Encourage fluid intake (  5.5  ). 
 *    Thrombocytopenia. Monitor platelet count during therapy for visceral leishmaniasis (  5.6  ,  6.1  ). 
 *    Absorption of Oral Contraceptives. Advise use of alternative method of contraception if vomiting and/or diarrhea occur (  5.7  ). 
 *    Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Discontinue IMPAVIDO (  5.8  ). 
    
 

   5.1  Embryo≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  Fetal≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   Toxicity≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE 



  Miltefosine may cause  fetal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   harm≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE .  Embryo≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  fetal≠I-NonOSE_AE   toxicity≠I-NonOSE_AE , including death and  teratogenicity≠B-NonOSE_AE , was observed in animals administered miltefosine prior to mating, during early  pregnancy≠B-NonOSE_AE , and during organogenesis at doses lower than the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). Do not use IMPAVIDO in  pregnant≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  women. Obtain a urine or serum  pregnancy≠B-NonOSE_AE  test prior to prescribing IMPAVIDO to females of reproductive potential. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during IMPAVIDO therapy and for 5 months after completion of therapy [see  Boxed Warning  , Contraindications (  4.1  ) and Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  ,  8.8  )]  .



    5.2 Reproductive Effects



   Females  



 Miltefosine caused  impaired≠B-NonOSE_AE   fertility≠I-NonOSE_AE  in rats and  reversible≠B-NonOSE_AE   follicular≠I-NonOSE_AE   atresia≠I-NonOSE_AE  and  diestrus≠B-NonOSE_AE  in dogs at doses approximately 1.0 and 0.2 times respectively the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons [see Nonclinical Toxicology (  13.1  )]  . Effects on human female fertility have not been formally studied.



  Males  



 Miltefosine caused  reduced≠B-NonOSE_AE  viable  sperm≠I-NonOSE_AE   counts≠I-NonOSE_AE  and  impaired≠B-NonOSE_AE   fertility≠I-NonOSE_AE  in rats at doses approximately 0.4 times the MRHD [see Nonclinical Toxicology (  13.1    ) ]  . A higher dose in rats, approximately 1.0 times the MRHD, caused  testicular≠B-NonOSE_AE   atrophy≠I-NonOSE_AE  and  impaired≠B-NonOSE_AE   fertility≠I-NonOSE_AE  that did not fully reverse 10 weeks after drug administration ended.



  Scrotal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  decreased≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  or absent  ejaculation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  during therapy have been reported during IMPAVIDO therapy [see Adverse Reactions (  6.2    ) ]  . The effects of IMPAVIDO on human male fertility have not been adequately studied.



 Advise women and men of the animal fertility findings, and that the potential for  impaired≠B-NonOSE_AE   fertility≠I-NonOSE_AE  with IMPAVIDO therapy in humans has not been adequately evaluated.



    5.3 Renal Effects



   Elevations≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   serum≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   creatinine≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  Cr≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ) were noted in clinical trials evaluating IMPAVIDO in the treatment of  cutaneous≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  ,≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   mucosal≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   and≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   visceral≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   leishmaniasis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Monitor renal function weekly in patients receiving IMPAVIDO during therapy and for 4 weeks after end of therapy [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  .



    5.4 Hepatic Effects



   Elevations≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   liver≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   transaminases≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (ALT, AST) and bilirubin were noted in clinical trials evaluating IMPAVIDO in the treatment of  visceral≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   leishmaniasis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Monitor liver transaminases (ALT, AST) and bilirubin during therapy in patients receiving IMPAVIDO [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  .



    5.5 Gastrointestinal Effects



   Vomiting≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and/or  diarrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  commonly occur during IMPAVIDO administration and may result in  volume≠B-NonOSE_AE   depletion≠I-NonOSE_AE . Encourage fluid intake to avoid  volume≠B-NonOSE_AE   depletion≠I-NonOSE_AE  [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  .



    5.6 Thrombocytopenia



   Thrombocytopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  during therapy has been reported in patients treated for  visceral≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   leishmaniasis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Monitor platelet count during therapy for  visceral≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   leishmaniasis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  ,  6.2  )]  .



    5.7 Absorption of Oral Contraceptives



   Vomiting≠B-NonOSE_AE  and/or  diarrhea≠B-NonOSE_AE  occurring during IMPAVIDO therapy may affect the absorption of oral contraceptives, and therefore compromise their efficacy. If  vomiting≠B-NonOSE_AE  and/or  diarrhea≠B-NonOSE_AE  occur during IMPAVIDO therapy, advise females to use additional non-hormonal or alternative method(s) of effective contraception.



    5.8 Stevens-Johnson Syndrome



   Stevens≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  Johnson≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   syndrome≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  has been reported during IMPAVIDO therapy. Discontinue IMPAVIDO if an  exfoliative≠B-NonOSE_AE  or bullous  rash≠I-NonOSE_AE  is noted during therapy [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  .
