   5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

   EXCERPT:    *  Clinical Worsening/Suicide Risk: Monitor for clinical worsening, suicidality and unusual change in behavior, especially, during the initial few months of therapy or at times of dose changes (  5.1  ). 
 *  Serotonin Syndrome: Serotonin syndrome has been reported with SSRIs and SNRIs, including Lexapro, both when taken alone, but especially when co-administered with other serotonergic agents (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John's Wort). If such symptoms occur, discontinue Lexapro and initiate supportive treatment. If concomitant use of Lexapro with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, patients should be made aware of a potential increased risk for serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases (  5.2  ). 
 *  Discontinuation of Treatment with Lexapro: A gradual reduction in dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible (  5.3  ). 
 *  Seizures: Prescribe with care in patients with a history of seizure (  5.4  ). 
 *  Activation of Mania/Hypomania: Use cautiously in patients with a history of mania (  5.5  ). 
 *  Hyponatremia: Can occur in association with SIADH (  5.6  ). 
 *  Abnormal Bleeding: Use caution in concomitant use with NSAIDs, aspirin, warfarin or other drugs that affect coagulation (  5.7  ). 
 *  Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance: Use caution when operating machinery (  5.8  ). 
 *  Angle Closure Glaucoma: Angle closure glaucoma has occurred in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles treated with antidepressants. (  5.9  ) 
 *  Use in Patients with Concomitant Illness: Use caution in patients with diseases or conditions that produce altered metabolism or hemodynamic responses (  5.10  ). 
    
 

   5.1 Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk

  Patients with  major≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depressive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   (≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  MDD≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ), both adult and pediatric, may experience  worsening≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   their≠I-NonOSE_AE   depression≠I-NonOSE_AE  and/or the emergence of  suicidal≠B-NonOSE_AE   ideation≠I-NonOSE_AE  and behavior ( suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE ) or  unusual≠B-NonOSE_AE   changes≠I-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   behavior≠I-NonOSE_AE , whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs.  Suicide≠B-NonOSE_AE  is a known risk of  depression≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and certain other  psychiatric≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorders≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of  suicide≠B-NonOSE_AE . There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing  worsening≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   depression≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and the emergence of  suicidality≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of  suicidal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  thinking and  behavior≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  ( suicidality≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18-24) with  major≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depressive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   (≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  MDD≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ) and other  psychiatric≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorders≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE  with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.

 The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with  MDD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ,  obsessive≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   compulsive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   (≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  OCD≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ), or other  psychiatric≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorders≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with  MDD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or other  psychiatric≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorders≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of  suicidality≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE  across the different indications, with the highest incidence in  MDD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate . The risk differences (drug vs. placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE  per 1000 patients treated) are provided in   Table 1  .  

 TABLE 1

                                     Increases Compared to Placebo

        No  suicides≠B-NonOSE_AE  occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were  suicides≠B-NonOSE_AE  in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on  suicide≠B-NonOSE_AE .
 

 It is unknown whether the  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE  risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with  depression≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of  depression≠B-NonOSE_AE .

 All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening,  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE , and  unusual≠B-NonOSE_AE   changes≠I-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   behavior≠I-NonOSE_AE , especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases.

 The following symptoms,  anxiety≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  agitation≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  panic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   attacks≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  insomnia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  irritability≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  hostility≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  aggressiveness≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  impulsivity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  akathisia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  ( psychomotor≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   restlessness≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ),  hypomania≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  mania≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for  major≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depressive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  as well as for other indications, both  psychiatric≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the  worsening≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   depression≠I-NonOSE_AE  and/or the emergence of  suicidal≠B-NonOSE_AE   impulses≠I-NonOSE_AE  has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE .

 Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose  depression≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE  or symptoms that might be precursors to  worsening≠B-NonOSE_AE   depression≠I-NonOSE_AE  or  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE , especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.

 If the decision has been made to discontinue treatment, medication should be tapered, as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that abrupt  discontinuation≠B-NonOSE_AE   can≠I-NonOSE_AE   be≠I-NonOSE_AE   associated≠I-NonOSE_AE   with≠I-NonOSE_AE   certain≠I-NonOSE_AE   symptoms≠I-NonOSE_AE  [ see Dosage and Administration (  2.4  )  ].

 Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for  major≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depressive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  or other indications, both  psychiatric≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of  agitation≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  irritability≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  unusual≠B-NonOSE_AE   changes≠I-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   behavior≠I-NonOSE_AE , and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE , and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers [ see also Patient Counseling Information (  17.1  )  ]. Prescriptions for Lexapro should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of  overdose≠B-NonOSE_AE .

    Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder  

 A  major≠B-NonOSE_AE   depressive≠I-NonOSE_AE   episode≠I-NonOSE_AE  may be the initial presentation of  bipolar≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of  precipitation≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   a≠I-NonOSE_AE   mixed≠I-NonOSE_AE  /≠I-NonOSE_AE  manic≠I-NonOSE_AE   episode≠I-NonOSE_AE  in patients at risk for  bipolar≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with  depressive≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   symptoms≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for  bipolar≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ; such screening should include a detailed  psychiatric≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  history, including a  family≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   history≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   of≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   suicide≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  bipolar≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , and  depression≠B-Not_AE_Candidate . It should be noted that Lexapro is not approved for use in treating  bipolar≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depression≠I-Not_AE_Candidate .

    5.2 Serotonin Syndrome

  The development of a potentially life-threatening  serotonin≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   syndrome≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  has been reported with SNRIs and SSRIs, including Lexapro, alone but particularly with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John's Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat  psychiatric≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorders≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue).

  Serotonin≠B-NonOSE_AE   syndrome≠I-NonOSE_AE  symptoms may include  mental≠B-NonOSE_AE   status≠I-NonOSE_AE   changes≠I-NonOSE_AE  (e.g.,  agitation≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  hallucinations≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  delirium≠B-NonOSE_AE , and  coma≠B-NonOSE_AE ),  autonomic≠B-NonOSE_AE   instability≠I-NonOSE_AE  (e.g.,  tachycardia≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  labile≠B-NonOSE_AE   blood≠I-NonOSE_AE   pressure≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  dizziness≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  diaphoresis≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  flushing≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  hyperthermia≠B-NonOSE_AE ),  neuromuscular≠B-NonOSE_AE   symptoms≠I-NonOSE_AE  (e.g.,  tremor≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  rigidity≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  myoclonus≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  hyperreflexia≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  incoordination≠B-NonOSE_AE )  seizures≠B-NonOSE_AE , and/or  gastrointestinal≠B-NonOSE_AE   symptoms≠I-NonOSE_AE  (e.g.,  nausea≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  vomiting≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  diarrhea≠B-NonOSE_AE ). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of  serotonin≠B-NonOSE_AE   syndrome≠I-NonOSE_AE .

 The concomitant use of Lexapro with MAOIs intended to treat  psychiatric≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorders≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  is contraindicated. Lexapro should also not be started in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. All reports with methylene blue that provided information on the route of administration involved intravenous administration in the dose range of 1 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection) or at lower doses. There may be circumstances when it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking Lexapro. Lexapro should be discontinued before initiating treatment with the MAOI [ see Contraindications (  4.1  ) and Dosage and Administration (  2.5  and  2.6  )  ].

 If concomitant use of Lexapro with other serotonergic drugs including, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, buspirone, tryptophan, amphetamine and St. John's Wort is clinically warranted, patients should be made aware of a potential increased risk for  serotonin≠B-NonOSE_AE   syndrome≠I-NonOSE_AE , particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases.

 Treatment with Lexapro and any concomitant serotonergic agents, should be discontinued immediately if the above events occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated.

    5.3 Discontinuation of Treatment with Lexapro

  During marketing of Lexapro and other SSRIs and SNRIs (serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), there have been spontaneous reports of  adverse≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   events≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   occurring≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   upon≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   discontinuation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including the following:  dysphoric≠B-NonOSE_AE   mood≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  irritability≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  agitation≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  dizziness≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  sensory≠B-NonOSE_AE   disturbances≠I-NonOSE_AE  (e.g.,  paresthesias≠B-NonOSE_AE  such as  electric≠B-NonOSE_AE   shock≠I-NonOSE_AE   sensations≠I-NonOSE_AE ),  anxiety≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  confusion≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  headache≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  lethargy≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  emotional≠B-NonOSE_AE   lability≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  insomnia≠B-NonOSE_AE , and  hypomania≠B-NonOSE_AE . While these events are generally self-limiting, there have been reports of serious  discontinuation≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   symptoms≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE .

 Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with Lexapro. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate [ see Dosage and Administration (  2.4  )  ].

    5.4 Seizures

  Although anticonvulsant effects of racemic citalopram have been observed in animal studies, Lexapro has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a  seizure≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . These patients were excluded from clinical studies during the product's premarketing testing. In clinical trials of Lexapro, cases of  convulsion≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported in association with Lexapro treatment. Like other drugs effective in the treatment of  major≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depressive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , Lexapro should be introduced with care in patients with a history of  seizure≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate .

    5.5 Activation of Mania/Hypomania

  In placebo-controlled trials of Lexapro in  major≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depressive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , activation of  mania≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE / hypomania≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was reported in one (0.1%) of 715 patients treated with Lexapro and in none of the 592 patients treated with placebo. One additional case of  hypomania≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  has been reported in association with Lexapro treatment. Activation of  mania≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE / hypomania≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  has also been reported in a small proportion of patients with  major≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   affective≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disorders≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  treated with racemic citalopram and other marketed drugs effective in the treatment of  major≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depressive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . As with all drugs effective in the treatment of  major≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depressive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , Lexapro should be used cautiously in patients with a history of  mania≠B-Not_AE_Candidate .

    5.6 Hyponatremia

   Hyponatremia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  may occur as a result of treatment with SSRIs and SNRIs, including Lexapro. In many cases, this  hyponatremia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  appears to be the result of the  syndrome≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   inappropriate≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   antidiuretic≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   hormone≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   secretion≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  SIADH≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ), and was reversible when Lexapro was discontinued. Cases with  serum≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   sodium≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   lower≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   than≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   1≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  1≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  0≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   mmol≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  /≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  L≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported. Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing  hyponatremia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  with SSRIs and SNRIs. Also, patients taking diuretics or who are otherwise  volume≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depleted≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  may be at greater risk [ see Geriatric Use (  8.5    )]. Discontinuation of Lexapro should be considered in patients with symptomatic  hyponatremia≠B-NonOSE_AE  and appropriate medical intervention should be instituted.

 Signs and symptoms of  hyponatremia≠B-NonOSE_AE  include  headache≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  difficulty≠B-NonOSE_AE   concentrating≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  memory≠B-NonOSE_AE   impairment≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  confusion≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  weakness≠B-NonOSE_AE , and  unsteadiness≠B-NonOSE_AE , which may lead to  falls≠B-NonOSE_AE . Signs and symptoms associated with more severe and/or acute cases have included  hallucination≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  syncope≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  seizure≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  coma≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  respiratory≠B-NonOSE_AE   arrest≠I-NonOSE_AE , and  death≠B-NonOSE_AE .

    5.7 Abnormal Bleeding

  SSRIs and SNRIs, including Lexapro, may increase the risk of  bleeding≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to the risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of  gastrointestinal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   bleeding≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE .  Bleeding≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  events related to SSRIs and SNRIs use have ranged from  ecchymoses≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  hematomas≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  epistaxis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  petechiae≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  to life-threatening  hemorrhages≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .

 Patients should be cautioned about the risk of  bleeding≠B-NonOSE_AE  associated with the concomitant use of Lexapro and NSAIDs, aspirin, or other drugs that affect coagulation.

    5.8 Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance

  In a study in normal volunteers, Lexapro 10 mg/day did not produce  impairment≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   intellectual≠I-NonOSE_AE   function≠I-NonOSE_AE  or psychomotor performance. Because any psychoactive drug may  impair≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  judgment, thinking, or  motor≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   skills≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , however, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that Lexapro therapy does not affect their ability to engage in such activities.

       5.9 Angle Closure Glaucoma

     Angle Closure Glaucoma: The  pupillary≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   dilation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including Lexapro may trigger an  angle≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   closure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   attack≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  in a patient with  anatomically≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   narrow≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   angles≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   who≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   does≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   not≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   have≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   a≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   patent≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   iridectomy≠I-Not_AE_Candidate .

    5.10 Use in Patients with Concomitant Illness

  Clinical experience with Lexapro in patients with certain concomitant systemic illnesses is limited. Caution is advisable in using Lexapro in patients with diseases or conditions that produce  altered≠B-NonOSE_AE   metabolism≠I-NonOSE_AE  or  hemodynamic≠B-NonOSE_AE   responses≠I-NonOSE_AE .

 Lexapro has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a recent history of  myocardial≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   infarction≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  or  unstable≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   heart≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Patients with these diagnoses were generally excluded from clinical studies during the product's premarketing testing.

 In subjects with  hepatic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   impairment≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , clearance of racemic citalopram was decreased and plasma concentrations were increased. The recommended dose of Lexapro in  hepatically≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   impaired≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  patients is 10 mg/day [ see Dosage and Administration (  2.3  )  ].

 Because escitalopram is extensively metabolized, excretion of unchanged drug in urine is a minor route of elimination. Until adequate numbers of patients with severe  renal≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   impairment≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  have been evaluated during chronic treatment with Lexapro, however, it should be used with caution in such patients [ see Dosage and Administration (  2.3  )  ].
