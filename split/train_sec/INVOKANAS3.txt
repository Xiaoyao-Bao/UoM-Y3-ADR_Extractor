   5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

   EXCERPT:    *   Lower limb amputation : See  boxed warning  (  5.1  ) 
 *   Hypotension : Before initiating INVOKANA, assess volume status and correct hypovolemia in patients with renal impairment, the elderly, in patients with low systolic blood pressure, or if on diuretics, ACEi, or ARB. Monitor for signs and symptoms during therapy (  5.2  ) 
 *   Ketoacidosis : Assess patients who present with signs and symptoms of metabolic acidosis for ketoacidosis, regardless of blood glucose level. If suspected, discontinue INVOKANA, evaluate and treat promptly. Before initiating INVOKANA, consider risk factors for ketoacidosis. Patients on INVOKANA may require monitoring and temporary discontinuation of therapy in clinical situations known to predispose to ketoacidosis (  5.3  ) 
 *   Acute kidney injury and impairment in renal function : Consider temporarily discontinuing in settings of reduced oral intake or fluid losses. If acute kidney injury occurs, discontinue and promptly treat. Monitor renal function during therapy (  5.4  ) 
 *   Hyperkalemia : Monitor potassium levels in patients with impaired renal function and in patients predisposed to hyperkalemia (  2.2  ,  5.5  ,  6.1  ,  8.6  ) 
 *   Urosepsis and pyelonephritis : Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated (  5.6  ) 
 *   Hypoglycemia : Consider a lower dose of insulin or the insulin secretagogue to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with INVOKANA (  5.7  ) 
 *   Genital mycotic infections : Monitor and treat if indicated (  5.8  ) 
 *   Hypersensitivity reactions : Discontinue INVOKANA and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve (  5.9  ) 
 *   Bone fracture : Consider factors that contribute to fracture risk before initiating INVOKANA (  5.10  ) 
 *   Increased LDL-C : Monitor LDL-C and treat if appropriate (  5.11  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Lower Limb Amputation

   An approximately 2-fold increased risk of  lower≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   limb≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   amputations≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  associated with INVOKANA use was observed in CANVAS and CANVAS-R, two large, randomized, placebo-controlled trials evaluating patients with type 2 diabetes who had either established  cardiovascular≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  or were at risk for  cardiovascular≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . In CANVAS, INVOKANA-treated patients and placebo-treated patients had 5.9 and 2.8  amputations≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  per 1000 patients per year, respectively. In CANVAS-R, INVOKANA-treated patients and placebo-treated patients had 7.5 and 4.2  amputations≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  per 1000 patients per year, respectively. The risk of  lower≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   limb≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   amputations≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  was observed at both the 100 mg and 300 mg once daily dosage regimens. The  amputation≠B-NonOSE_AE  data for CANVAS and CANVAS-R are shown in Tables 2 and 3, respectively [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].    

   Amputations≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  the toe and  midfoot≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (99 out of 140 patients with  amputations≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  receiving INVOKANA in the two trials) were the most frequent; however,  amputations≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   involving≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   the≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   leg≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , below and above the knee, were also observed (41 out of 140 patients with  amputations≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  receiving INVOKANA in the two trials). Some patients had multiple  amputations≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , some involving both lower limbs.  

   Lower≠B-NonOSE_AE   limb≠I-NonOSE_AE   infections≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  gangrene≠B-NonOSE_AE , and  diabetic≠B-NonOSE_AE   foot≠I-NonOSE_AE   ulcers≠I-NonOSE_AE  were the most common precipitating medical events leading to the need for an  amputation≠B-NonOSE_AE . The risk of  amputation≠B-NonOSE_AE  was highest in patients with a baseline history of prior  amputation≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ,  peripheral≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   vascular≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , and  neuropathy≠B-Not_AE_Candidate .  

  Before initiating INVOKANA, consider factors in the patient history that may predispose to the need for  amputations≠B-NonOSE_AE , such as a history of prior  amputation≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ,  peripheral≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   vascular≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  neuropathy≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and  diabetic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   foot≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   ulcers≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Counsel patients about the importance of routine preventative foot care. Monitor patients receiving INVOKANA for signs and symptoms of  infection≠B-NonOSE_AE  (including  osteomyelitis≠B-NonOSE_AE ), new  pain≠B-NonOSE_AE  or tenderness, sores or ulcers involving the  lower≠I-NonOSE_AE   limbs≠I-NonOSE_AE , and discontinue INVOKANA if these complications occur.  

    5.2 Hypotension

  INVOKANA causes  intravascular≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   volume≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   contraction≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . Symptomatic  hypotension≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  can occur after initiating INVOKANA [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  particularly in patients with  impaired≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   renal≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   function≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  ( eGFR≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   less≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   than≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   6≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  0≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   mL≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  /≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  min≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  /≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  1≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  .≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  7≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  3≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   m≠I-Not_AE_Candidate    2≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   ), elderly patients, patients on either diuretics or medications that interfere with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g., angiotensin-converting-enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]), or patients with  low≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   systolic≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   blood≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   pressure≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Before initiating INVOKANA in patients with one or more of these characteristics, volume status should be assessed and corrected. Monitor for signs and symptoms after initiating therapy.

    5.3 Ketoacidosis

  Reports of  ketoacidosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , a serious life-threatening condition requiring urgent hospitalization have been identified in postmarketing surveillance in patients with  type≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   1≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and type 2  diabetes≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   mellitus≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  receiving sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, including INVOKANA.  Fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE  cases of  ketoacidosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported in patients taking INVOKANA. INVOKANA is not indicated for the treatment of patients with  type≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   1≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   diabetes≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   mellitus≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  [see  Indications and Usage (1)  ]  .

 Patients treated with INVOKANA who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe  metabolic≠B-NonOSE_AE   acidosis≠I-NonOSE_AE  should be assessed for  ketoacidosis≠B-NonOSE_AE  regardless of presenting blood glucose levels, as  ketoacidosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  associated with INVOKANA may be present even if  blood≠B-NonOSE_AE   glucose≠I-NonOSE_AE   levels≠I-NonOSE_AE   are≠I-NonOSE_AE   less≠I-NonOSE_AE   than≠I-NonOSE_AE   2≠I-NonOSE_AE  5≠I-NonOSE_AE  0≠I-NonOSE_AE   mg≠I-NonOSE_AE  /≠I-NonOSE_AE  dL≠I-NonOSE_AE . If  ketoacidosis≠B-NonOSE_AE  is suspected, INVOKANA should be discontinued, patient should be evaluated, and prompt treatment should be instituted. Treatment of  ketoacidosis≠B-NonOSE_AE  may require insulin, fluid and carbohydrate replacement.

 In many of the postmarketing reports, and particularly in patients with  type≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   1≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   diabetes≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , the presence of  ketoacidosis≠B-NonOSE_AE  was not immediately recognized and institution of treatment was delayed because presenting  blood≠B-NonOSE_AE   glucose≠I-NonOSE_AE   levels≠I-NonOSE_AE   were≠I-NonOSE_AE   below≠I-NonOSE_AE  those typically expected for  diabetic≠B-NonOSE_AE   ketoacidosis≠I-NonOSE_AE  (often less than 250 mg/dL). Signs and symptoms at presentation were consistent with  dehydration≠B-NonOSE_AE  and severe  metabolic≠B-NonOSE_AE   acidosis≠I-NonOSE_AE  and included  nausea≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  vomiting≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  abdominal≠B-NonOSE_AE   pain≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  generalized≠B-NonOSE_AE   malaise≠I-NonOSE_AE , and  shortness≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   breath≠I-NonOSE_AE . In some but not all cases, factors predisposing to  ketoacidosis≠B-NonOSE_AE  such as insulin dose reduction,  acute≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   febrile≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   illness≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , reduced caloric intake due to illness or surgery,  pancreatic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorders≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  suggesting  insulin≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   deficiency≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  (e.g.,  type≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   1≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   diabetes≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , history of  pancreatitis≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or pancreatic surgery), and alcohol abuse were identified.

 Before initiating INVOKANA, consider factors in the patient history that may predispose to  ketoacidosis≠B-NonOSE_AE  including  pancreatic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   insulin≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   deficiency≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  from any cause, caloric restriction, and alcohol abuse. In patients treated with INVOKANA consider monitoring for  ketoacidosis≠B-NonOSE_AE  and temporarily discontinuing INVOKANA in clinical situations known to predispose to  ketoacidosis≠B-NonOSE_AE  (e.g., prolonged fasting due to  acute≠B-NonOSE_AE   illness≠I-NonOSE_AE  or surgery).

    5.4 Acute Kidney Injury and Impairment in Renal Function

  INVOKANA causes  intravascular≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   volume≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   contraction≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]  and can cause  renal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   impairment≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . There have been postmarketing reports of  acute≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   kidney≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   injury≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , some requiring hospitalization and  dialysis≠B-NonOSE_AE , in patients receiving INVOKANA; some reports involved patients younger than 65 years of age.

 Before initiating INVOKANA, consider factors that may predispose patients to  acute≠B-NonOSE_AE   kidney≠I-NonOSE_AE   injury≠I-NonOSE_AE  including  hypovolemia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ,  chronic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   renal≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   insufficiency≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  congestive≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   heart≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   failure≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and concomitant medications (diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, NSAIDs). Consider temporarily discontinuing INVOKANA in any setting of reduced oral intake (such as  acute≠B-NonOSE_AE   illness≠I-NonOSE_AE  or fasting) or  fluid≠B-NonOSE_AE   losses≠I-NonOSE_AE  (such as  gastrointestinal≠B-NonOSE_AE   illness≠I-NonOSE_AE  or excessive heat exposure); monitor patients for signs and symptoms of  acute≠B-NonOSE_AE   kidney≠I-NonOSE_AE   injury≠I-NonOSE_AE . If  acute≠B-NonOSE_AE   kidney≠I-NonOSE_AE   injury≠I-NonOSE_AE  occurs, discontinue INVOKANA promptly and institute treatment.

 INVOKANA  increases≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   serum≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   creatinine≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  decreases≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   eGFR≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . Patients with  hypovolemia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  may be more susceptible to these changes.  Renal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   function≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   abnormalities≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  can occur after initiating INVOKANA [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Renal function should be evaluated prior to initiation of INVOKANA and monitored periodically thereafter. Dosage adjustment and more frequent renal function monitoring are recommended in patients with  an≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   eGFR≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   below≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   6≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  0≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   mL≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  /≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  min≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  /≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  1≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  .≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  7≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  3≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   m≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   2  . Use of INVOKANA is not recommended when  eGFR≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   is≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   persistently≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   less≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   than≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   4≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  5≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   mL≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  /≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  min≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  /≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  1≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  .≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  7≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  3≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   m≠I-Not_AE_Candidate    2≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   and is contraindicated in patients with an  eGFR≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   less≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   than≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   3≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  0≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   mL≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  /≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  min≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  /≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  1≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  .≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  7≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  3≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   m≠I-Not_AE_Candidate    2≠I-Not_AE_Candidate     [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ,  Contraindications (4)  and  Use in Specific Populations (8.6)  ]  .

    5.5 Hyperkalemia

  INVOKANA can lead to  hyperkalemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . Patients with  moderate≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   renal≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   impairment≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  who are taking medications that interfere with potassium excretion, such as potassium-sparing diuretics, or medications that interfere with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are at an increased risk of developing  hyperkalemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .

 Monitor serum potassium levels periodically after initiating INVOKANA in patients with  impaired≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   renal≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   function≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and in patients predisposed to  hyperkalemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  due to medications or other medical conditions.

    5.6 Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis

  There have been postmarketing reports of serious  urinary≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   tract≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infections≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  including  urosepsis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  pyelonephritis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  requiring hospitalization in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including INVOKANA. Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors increases the risk for  urinary≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   tract≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infections≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of  urinary≠B-NonOSE_AE   tract≠I-NonOSE_AE   infections≠I-NonOSE_AE  and treat promptly, if indicated [see  Adverse Reactions (6)  ]  .

    5.7 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues

  Insulin and insulin secretagogues are known to cause  hypoglycemia≠B-NonOSE_AE . INVOKANA can increase the risk of  hypoglycemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  when combined with insulin or an insulin secretagogue [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of  hypoglycemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  when used in combination with INVOKANA.

    5.8 Genital Mycotic Infections

  INVOKANA increases the risk of  genital≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   mycotic≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infections≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . Patients with a history of  genital≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   mycotic≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   infections≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and uncircumcised males were more likely to develop  genital≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   mycotic≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infections≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Monitor and treat appropriately.

    5.9 Hypersensitivity Reactions

   Hypersensitivity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , including  angioedema≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  anaphylaxis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , have been reported with INVOKANA. These reactions generally occurred within hours to days after initiating INVOKANA. If  hypersensitivity≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE  occur, discontinue use of INVOKANA; treat and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve [see  Contraindications (4)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1  ,  6.2)  ]  .

    5.10 Bone Fracture

  An increased risk of  bone≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   fracture≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , occurring as early as 12 weeks after treatment initiation, was observed in patients using INVOKANA. Consider factors that contribute to fracture risk prior to initiating INVOKANA [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .

    5.11 Increases in Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL-C)

  Dose-related  increases≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   LDL≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  C≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  occur with INVOKANA [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Monitor LDL-C and treat if appropriate after initiating INVOKANA.

    5.12 Macrovascular Outcomes

  There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of  macrovascular≠B-NonOSE_AE  risk reduction with INVOKANA [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .
