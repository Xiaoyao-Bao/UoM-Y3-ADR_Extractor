    6  ADVERSE REACTIONS

    Long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists, such as STRIVERDI RESPIMAT, increase the risk of  asthma≠B-NonOSE_AE -related  death≠B-NonOSE_AE . STRIVERDI RESPIMAT is not indicated for the treatment of  asthma≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  [  see Boxed Warning and Warning and Precautions (  5.1  )  ].  



   EXCERPT:   Most common adverse reactions (incidence >=2% and more than placebo) are nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, urinary tract infection, cough, dizziness, rash, diarrhea, back pain and arthralgia (  6.1  )

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The STRIVERDI RESPIMAT clinical development program included seven dose-ranging trials and eight confirmatory trials. Four of the confirmatory trials were 6-week cross-over trials and four were 48-week parallel group trials. Adverse reactions observed in the dose-ranging trials and four 6-week cross-over trials were consistent with those observed in the 48-week parallel group trials, which formed the primary safety database.



 The primary safety database consisted of pooled data from the four 48-week double-blind, active and placebo-controlled, parallel group confirmatory clinical trials. These trials included 3104 adult  COPD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  patients (77% males and 23% females) 40 years of age and older. Of these patients, 876 and 883 patients were treated with STRIVERDI RESPIMAT 5 mcg and 10 mcg once-daily, respectively. The STRIVERDI RESPIMAT groups were composed of mostly Caucasians (66%) with a mean age of 64 years and a mean percent predicted FEV1at baseline of 44% for both the 5 mcg and 10 mcg treatment groups. Control arms for comparison included placebo in all four trials plus formoterol 12 mcg in two trials.



 In these four clinical trials, seventy-two percent (72%) of patients exposed to any dose of STRIVERDI RESPIMAT reported an adverse reaction compared to 71% in the placebo group. The proportion of patients who discontinued due to an adverse reaction was 7.2% for STRIVERDI RESPIMAT treated patients compared to 8.8% for placebo treated patients. The adverse reaction most commonly leading to discontinuation was  worsening≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   COPD≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . The most common serious adverse reactions were  COPD≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   exacerbation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  pneumonia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  atrial≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   fibrillation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE .



 Table 1 shows all adverse drug reactions reported by at least 2% of patients (and higher than placebo) who received STRIVERDI RESPIMAT 5 mcg during the 48-week trials.
