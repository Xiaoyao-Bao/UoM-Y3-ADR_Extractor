   5.1 Infusion Reactions

  Serious  infusion≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , requiring medical intervention and immediate, permanent discontinuation of Erbitux included rapid onset of  airway≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   obstruction≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  ( bronchospasm≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  stridor≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  hoarseness≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ),  hypotension≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  shock≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  loss≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   consciousness≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  myocardial≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   infarction≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and/or  cardiac≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   arrest≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . Severe (NCI CTC Grades 3 and 4)  infusion≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred in 2-5% of 1373 patients in Studies 1, 3, 5, and 6 receiving Erbitux, with  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE  outcome in 1 patient. [See   Clinical Studies (14.1  ,  14.2)    .]

 Approximately 90% of severe  infusion≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred with the first infusion despite premedication with antihistamines.

 Monitor patients for 1 hour following Erbitux infusions in a setting with resuscitation equipment and other agents necessary to treat  anaphylaxis≠B-NonOSE_AE  (eg, epinephrine, corticosteroids, intravenous antihistamines, bronchodilators, and oxygen). Monitor longer to confirm resolution of the event in patients requiring treatment for  infusion≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE .

 Immediately and permanently discontinue Erbitux in patients with serious  infusion≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE . [See   Boxed Warning  ,  Dosage and Administration (2.4)    .]

    5.2 Cardiopulmonary Arrest

   Cardiopulmonary≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   arrest≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and/or  sudden≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   death≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred in 4 (2%) of 208 patients treated with radiation therapy and Erbitux as compared to none of 212 patients treated with radiation therapy alone in Study 1. Three patients with prior history of  coronary≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   artery≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   died≠B-NonOSE_AE  at home, with  myocardial≠B-NonOSE_AE   infarction≠I-NonOSE_AE  as the presumed cause of  death≠B-NonOSE_AE . One of these patients had  arrhythmia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and one had  congestive≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   heart≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   failure≠I-Not_AE_Candidate .  Death≠B-NonOSE_AE  occurred 27, 32, and 43 days after the last dose of Erbitux. One patient with no prior history of  coronary≠B-NonOSE_AE   artery≠I-NonOSE_AE   disease≠I-NonOSE_AE   died≠B-NonOSE_AE  one day after the last dose of Erbitux. In Study 2,  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE   cardiac≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   disorders≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and/or  sudden≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   death≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred in 7 (3%) of 219 patients treated with EU-approved cetuximab and platinum-based therapy with 5-FU as compared to 4 (2%) of 215 patients treated with chemotherapy alone. Five of these 7 patients in the chemotherapy plus cetuximab arm received concomitant cisplatin and 2 patients received concomitant carboplatin. All 4 patients in the chemotherapy-alone arm received cisplatin. Carefully consider use of Erbitux in combination with radiation therapy or platinum-based therapy with 5-FU in  head≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   and≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   neck≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  patients with a history of  coronary≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   artery≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  congestive≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   heart≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   failure≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , or  arrhythmias≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  in light of these risks. Closely monitor serum electrolytes, including serum magnesium, potassium, and calcium, during and after Erbitux. [See   Boxed Warning  ,  Warnings and Precautions (5.6)    .]

    5.3  Pulmonary≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   Toxicity≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE 

   Interstitial≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   lung≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   disease≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  ILD≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ), including 1  fatality≠B-NonOSE_AE , occurred in 4 of 1570 (<0.5%) patients receiving Erbitux in Studies 1, 3, and 6, as well as other studies, in  colorectal≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and  head≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   and≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   neck≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Interrupt Erbitux for acute onset or  worsening≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   pulmonary≠I-NonOSE_AE   symptoms≠I-NonOSE_AE . Permanently discontinue Erbitux for confirmed  ILD≠B-NonOSE_AE .

    5.4 Dermatologic Toxicity

   Dermatologic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   toxicities≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , including  acneiform≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   rash≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  skin≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   drying≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and fissuring,  paronychial≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   inflammation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  infectious≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   sequelae≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (for example,  S≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  .≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   aureus≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE    sepsis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  abscess≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   formation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  cellulitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  blepharitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  conjunctivitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  keratitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE / ulcerative≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   keratitis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  with  decreased≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   visual≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   acuity≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  cheilitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ), and  hypertrichosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred in patients receiving Erbitux therapy.  Acneiform≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   rash≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred in 76-88% of 1373 patients receiving Erbitux in Studies 1, 3, 5, and 6. Severe  acneiform≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   rash≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred in 1-17% of patients.

  Acneiform≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   rash≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  usually developed within the first two weeks of therapy and resolved in a majority of the patients after cessation of treatment, although in nearly half, the event continued beyond 28 days. Life-threatening and  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE   bullous≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   mucocutaneous≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   disease≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  with blisters, erosions, and skin sloughing has also been observed in patients treated with Erbitux. It could not be determined whether these  mucocutaneous≠B-NonOSE_AE   adverse≠I-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE  were directly related to  EGFR≠B-NonOSE_AE   inhibition≠I-NonOSE_AE  or to idiosyncratic  immune≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  related≠I-NonOSE_AE   effects≠I-NonOSE_AE  (eg,  Stevens≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  Johnson≠I-NonOSE_AE   syndrome≠I-NonOSE_AE  or  toxic≠B-NonOSE_AE   epidermal≠I-NonOSE_AE   necrolysis≠I-NonOSE_AE ). Monitor patients receiving Erbitux for  dermatologic≠B-NonOSE_AE   toxicities≠I-NonOSE_AE  and  infectious≠B-NonOSE_AE   sequelae≠I-NonOSE_AE . Instruct patients to limit sun exposure during Erbitux therapy. [See   Dosage and Administration (2.4)    .]

    5.5 Use of Erbitux in Combination With Radiation and Cisplatin

  In a controlled study, 940 patients with locally advanced  SCCHN≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  were randomized 1:1 to receive either Erbitux in combination with radiation therapy and cisplatin or radiation therapy and cisplatin alone. The addition of Erbitux resulted in an increase in the incidence of Grade 3-4  mucositis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  radiation≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   recall≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   syndrome≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  acneiform≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   rash≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  cardiac≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   events≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  electrolyte≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   disturbances≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  compared to radiation and cisplatin alone. Adverse reactions with  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE  outcome were reported in 20 patients (4.4%) in the Erbitux combination arm and 14 patients (3.0%) in the control arm. Nine patients in the Erbitux arm (2.0%) experienced  myocardial≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   ischemia≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  compared to 4 patients (0.9%) in the control arm. The main efficacy outcome of the study was progression-free survival (PFS). The addition of Erbitux to radiation and cisplatin did not improve PFS.

    5.6 Hypomagnesemia and Electrolyte Abnormalities

  In patients evaluated during clinical trials,  hypomagnesemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred in 55% of 365 patients receiving Erbitux in Study 5 and two other clinical trials in  colorectal≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and  head≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   and≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   neck≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , respectively, and was severe (NCI CTC Grades 3 and 4) in 6-17%.

 In Study 2, where EU-approved cetuximab was administered in combination with platinum-based therapy, the addition of cetuximab to cisplatin and 5-FU resulted in an increased incidence of  hypomagnesemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (14% vs. 6%) and of Grade 3-4  hypomagnesemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (7% vs. 2%) compared to cisplatin and 5-FU alone. In contrast, the incidences of  hypomagnesemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  were similar for those who received cetuximab, carboplatin, and 5-FU compared to carboplatin and 5-FU (4% vs. 4%). No patient experienced Grade 3-4  hypomagnesemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  in either arm in the carboplatin subgroup.

 The onset of  hypomagnesemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and accompanying  electrolyte≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   abnormalities≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred days to months after initiation of Erbitux. Periodically monitor patients for  hypomagnesemia≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  hypocalcemia≠B-NonOSE_AE , and  hypokalemia≠B-NonOSE_AE , during and for at least 8 weeks following the completion of Erbitux. Replete electrolytes as necessary.

    5.7 Increased Tumor Progression, Increased Mortality, or Lack of Benefit in Patients with Ras  -Mutant mCRC

  Erbitux is not indicated for the treatment of patients with  colorectal≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  that harbor somatic mutations in exon 2 (codons 12 and 13), exon 3 (codons 59 and 61), and exon 4 (codons 117 and 146) of either K-Ras  or N-Ras  and hereafter is referred to as " Ras  ."

 Retrospective subset analyses of Ras  -mutant and wild-type populations across several randomized clinical trials including Study 4 were conducted to investigate the role of Ras  mutations on the clinical effects of anti-EGFR-directed monoclonal antibodies. Use of cetuximab in patients with Ras  mutations resulted in no clinical benefit with treatment related toxicity. [See   Indications and Usage (1.2)  ,  Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)  ,  Clinical Studies (14.2)    .]

    5.8 Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Expression and Response

  Because expression of EGFR has been detected in nearly all  SCCHN≠B-NonOSE_AE   tumor≠I-NonOSE_AE  specimens, patients enrolled in the  head≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   and≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   neck≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  clinical studies were not required to have immunohistochemical evidence of  EGFR≠B-NonOSE_AE   tumor≠I-NonOSE_AE   expression≠I-NonOSE_AE  prior to study entry.

 Patients enrolled in the  colorectal≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  clinical studies were required to have immunohistochemical evidence of  EGFR≠B-NonOSE_AE   tumor≠I-NonOSE_AE   expression≠I-NonOSE_AE .  Primary≠B-NonOSE_AE   tumor≠I-NonOSE_AE  or  tumor≠B-NonOSE_AE   from≠I-NonOSE_AE   a≠I-NonOSE_AE   metastatic≠I-NonOSE_AE   site≠I-NonOSE_AE  was tested with the DakoCytomation EGFR pharmDxTM test kit. Specimens were scored based on the percentage of cells expressing EGFR and intensity (barely/faint, weak-to-moderate, and strong). Response rate did not correlate with either the percentage of positive cells or the intensity of EGFR expression.
