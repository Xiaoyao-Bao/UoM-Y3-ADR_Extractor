   5.1        Cardiac≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   Toxicities≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE 

  New onset or worsening of pre-existing  cardiac≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   failure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (e.g.,  congestive≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   heart≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   failure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  pulmonary≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   edema≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  decreased≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   ejection≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   fraction≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ),  restrictive≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   cardiomyopathy≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  myocardial≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   ischemia≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  myocardial≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   infarction≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  including  fatalities≠B-NonOSE_AE  have occurred following administration of Kyprolis.  Some events occurred in patients with normal baseline ventricular function.  In clinical studies with Kyprolis, these events occurred throughout the course of Kyprolis therapy.  Death≠B-NonOSE_AE  due to  cardiac≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   arrest≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  has occurred within one day of Kyprolis administration.  In a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial evaluating Kyprolis in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (KRd) versus  lenalidomide/dexamethasone (Rd), the incidence of  cardiac≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   failure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   events≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  was 6% in the KRd arm versus  4% in the Rd arm.  In a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial of Kyprolis plus dexamethasone (Kd) versus  bortezomib plus dexamethasone (Vd), the incidence of  cardiac≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   failure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   events≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  was 8% in the Kd arm versus  3% in the Vd arm.

 Monitor patients for clinical signs or symptoms of  cardiac≠B-NonOSE_AE   failure≠I-NonOSE_AE  or  cardiac≠B-NonOSE_AE   ischemia≠I-NonOSE_AE .  Evaluate promptly if  cardiac≠B-NonOSE_AE   toxicity≠I-NonOSE_AE  is suspected.  Withhold Kyprolis for Grade 3 or 4  cardiac≠B-NonOSE_AE   adverse≠I-NonOSE_AE   events≠I-NonOSE_AE  until recovery, and consider whether to restart Kyprolis at 1 dose level reduction based on a benefit/risk assessment [see    Dosage and Administration    (     2.3     )   ]  .

 While adequate hydration is required prior to each dose in Cycle 1, all patients should also be monitored for evidence of  volume≠B-NonOSE_AE   overload≠I-NonOSE_AE , especially patients at risk for  cardiac≠B-NonOSE_AE   failure≠I-NonOSE_AE . Adjust total fluid intake as clinically appropriate in patients with baseline  cardiac≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   failure≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  or who are at risk for  cardiac≠B-NonOSE_AE   failure≠I-NonOSE_AE  [see Dosage and Administration    (     2.1     )   ]  .

  In patients >= 75 years of age, the risk of  cardiac≠B-NonOSE_AE   failure≠I-NonOSE_AE  is increased compared to patients ˂ 75 years of age. Patients with  New≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   York≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   Heart≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   Association≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   Class≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   III≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and IV  heart≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   failure≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , recent  myocardial≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   infarction≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  conduction≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   abnormalities≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  angina≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , or  arrhythmias≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  uncontrolled by medications were not eligible for the clinical trials. These patients may be at greater risk for  cardiac≠B-NonOSE_AE   complications≠I-NonOSE_AE  and should have a comprehensive medical assessment (including blood pressure and fluid management) prior to starting treatment with Kyprolis and remain under close follow-up  [see Use in Specific Populations   (     8.5     )]  .  

    5.2       Acute Renal Failure

  Cases of  acute≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   renal≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   failure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  have occurred in patients receiving Kyprolis.  Renal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   insufficiency≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  adverse events (including  renal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   failure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ) have occurred in approximately 10% of patients treated with Kyprolis.  Acute≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   renal≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   failure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  was reported more frequently in patients with advanced relapsed and refractory  multiple≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   myeloma≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  who received Kyprolis monotherapy. This risk was greater in patients with a baseline  reduced≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   estimated≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   creatinine≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   clearance≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  (calculated using Cockcroft and Gault equation). Monitor renal function with regular measurement of the serum creatinine and/or estimated creatinine clearance. Reduce or withhold dose as appropriate [see Dosage and Administration    (     2.3     )]  .

    5.3       Tumor Lysis Syndrome

  Cases of  tumor≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   lysis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   syndrome≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  TLS≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ), including  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE  outcomes, have been reported in patients who received Kyprolis. Patients with  multiple≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   myeloma≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and a high  tumor≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   burden≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  should be considered to be at greater risk for  TLS≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . Ensure that patients are well hydrated before administration of Kyprolis in Cycle 1, and in subsequent cycles as needed [see    Dosage and Administration   (     2.1     )]  . Consider uric acid-lowering drugs in patients at risk for  TLS≠B-NonOSE_AE . Monitor for evidence of TLS during treatment and manage promptly, including interruption of Kyprolis until TLS is resolved [see Dosage and Administration   (     2.1     )]  .

    5.4       Pulmonary Toxicity

   Acute≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   Respiratory≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   Distress≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   Syndrome≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  ARDS≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ),  acute≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   respiratory≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   failure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  acute≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   diffuse≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infiltrative≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   pulmonary≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   disease≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  such as  pneumonitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  interstitial≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   lung≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   disease≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  have occurred in less than 1% of patients receiving Kyprolis. Some events have been  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE . In the event of drug-induced  pulmonary≠B-NonOSE_AE   toxicity≠I-NonOSE_AE , discontinue Kyprolis [see    Dosage and Administration    (     2.3     )]  .

    5.5       Pulmonary Hypertension

   Pulmonary≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   arterial≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   hypertension≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  was reported in approximately 1% of patients treated with Kyprolis and was Grade 3 or greater in less than 1% of patients. Evaluate with cardiac imaging and/or other tests as indicated.  Withhold Kyprolis for  pulmonary≠B-NonOSE_AE   hypertension≠I-NonOSE_AE  until resolved or returned to baseline, and consider whether to restart Kyprolis based on a benefit/risk assessment [see   Dosage and Administration   (     2.3     )   ]  .

    5.6       Dyspnea

   Dyspnea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was reported in 28% of patients treated with Kyprolis and was Grade 3 or greater in 4% of patients. Evaluate  dyspnea≠B-NonOSE_AE  to exclude  cardiopulmonary≠B-NonOSE_AE   conditions≠I-NonOSE_AE  including  cardiac≠B-NonOSE_AE   failure≠I-NonOSE_AE  and  pulmonary≠B-NonOSE_AE   syndromes≠I-NonOSE_AE .  Stop Kyprolis for Grade 3 or 4  dyspnea≠B-NonOSE_AE  until resolved or returned to baseline.  Consider whether to restart Kyprolis based on a benefit/risk assessment  [see Dosage and Administration   (     2.3     )   ,       Warnings and Precautions   (     5.1      and     5.4     )   ,   and Adverse Reactions   (     6.1     )]  .

    5.7       Hypertension

   Hypertension≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , including  hypertensive≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   crisis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  hypertensive≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   emergency≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , has been observed with Kyprolis.  In a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial evaluating Kyprolis in combination with KRd versus  Rd, the incidence of  hypertension≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  events was 16% in the KRd arm versus  8% in the Rd arm.  In a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial of Kd versus  Vd, the incidence of  hypertension≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  events was 26% in the Kd arm versus  10% in the Vd arm. Some of these events have been  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE . Monitor blood pressure regularly in all patients. If  hypertension≠B-NonOSE_AE  cannot be adequately controlled, withhold Kyprolis and evaluate. Consider whether to restart Kyprolis based on a benefit/risk assessment [see Dosage and Administration   (     2     )]  .

    5.8       Venous Thrombosis

    Venous≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   thromboembolic≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   events≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (including  deep≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   venous≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   thrombosis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  pulmonary≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   embolism≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ) have been observed with Kyprolis. In a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial evaluating KRd versus  Rd (with thromboprophylaxis used in both arms), the incidence of  venous≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   thromboembolic≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   events≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  in the first 12 cycles was 13% in the KRd arm versus  6% in the Rd arm. In a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial of Kd versus  Vd, the incidence of  venous≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   thromboembolic≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   events≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  in months 1-6 was 9% in the Kd arm versus  2% in the Vd arm. With Kyprolis monotherapy, the incidence of  venous≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   thromboembolic≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   events≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  was 2%.  

  Thromboprophylaxis is recommended for patients being treated with the combination of Kyprolis with dexamethasone or with lenalidomide plus dexamethasone.  The thromboprophylaxis regimen should be based on an assessment of the patient's underlying risks.  

  Patients using oral contraceptives or a hormonal method of contraception associated with a risk of  thrombosis≠B-NonOSE_AE  should consider an alternative method of effective contraception during treatment with Kyprolis in combination with dexamethasone or lenalidomide plus dexamethasone  [see Use in Specific Population (     8.3     )]   .    

    5.9       Infusion Reactions

   Infusion≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , including life-threatening reactions, have occurred in patients receiving Kyprolis. Symptoms include  fever≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  chills≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  arthralgia≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  myalgia≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  facial≠B-NonOSE_AE   flushing≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  facial≠B-NonOSE_AE   edema≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  vomiting≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  weakness≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  shortness≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   breath≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  hypotension≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  syncope≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  chest≠B-NonOSE_AE   tightness≠I-NonOSE_AE , or  angina≠B-NonOSE_AE . These reactions can occur immediately following or up to 24 hours after administration of Kyprolis. Administer dexamethasone prior to Kyprolis to reduce the incidence and severity of  infusion≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE  [see Dosage and Administration   (     2     )]  . Inform patients of the risk and of symptoms and to contact a physician immediately if symptoms of an  infusion≠B-NonOSE_AE   reaction≠I-NonOSE_AE  occur.

    5.10       Hemorrhage

    Fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE  or serious cases of  hemorrhage≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported in patients treated with Kyprolis.  Hemorrhagic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   events≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  have included  gastrointestinal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , pulmonary, and intracranial  hemorrhage≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  epistaxis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . The  bleeding≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  can be spontaneous, and  intracranial≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   hemorrhage≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  has occurred without trauma.  Hemorrhage≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  has been reported in patients having either  low≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or normal  platelet≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   counts≠I-Not_AE_Candidate .  Hemorrhage≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  has also been reported in patients who were not on antiplatelet therapy or anticoagulation. Promptly evaluate signs and symptoms of  blood≠B-NonOSE_AE   loss≠I-NonOSE_AE . Reduce or withhold dose as appropriate [   see Dosage and Administration (     2.3     )   and Adverse Reactions (     6.1     )].    

    5.11       Thrombocytopenia

   Kyprolis causes  thrombocytopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  with platelet nadirs observed between Day 8 and Day 15 of each 28-day cycle, with recovery to baseline platelet count usually by the start of the next cycle [see Adverse Reactions   (     6.1     )]  .  Thrombocytopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was reported in approximately 40% of patients in clinical trials with Kyprolis. Monitor platelet counts frequently during treatment with Kyprolis. Reduce or withhold dose as appropriate [see Dosage and Administration    (     2.3     )]  .  Hemorrhage≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  may occur [see   Adverse Reactions (     6.1     ) and Warnings and Precautions (     5.10     )   ].    

    5.12       Hepatic Toxicity and Hepatic Failure

  Cases of  hepatic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   failure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , including  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE  cases, have been reported (< 1%) during treatment with Kyprolis. Kyprolis can cause  increased≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   serum≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   transaminases≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . Monitor liver enzymes regularly, regardless of baseline values. Reduce or withhold dose as appropriate [see Dosage and Administration   (     2.3     )   and Adverse Reactions   (     6.1     )]  .

    5.13       Thrombotic Microangiopathy

   Cases of  thrombotic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   microangiopathy≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , including  thrombotic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   thrombocytopenic≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   purpura≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE / hemolytic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   uremic≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   syndrome≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  ( TTP≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE / HUS≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ), have been reported in patients who received Kyprolis.  Some of these events have been  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE . Monitor for signs and symptoms of  TTP≠B-NonOSE_AE / HUS≠B-NonOSE_AE . If the diagnosis is suspected, stop Kyprolis and evaluate. If the diagnosis of  TTP≠B-NonOSE_AE / HUS≠B-NonOSE_AE  is excluded, Kyprolis may be restarted. The safety of reinitiating Kyprolis therapy in patients previously experiencing  TTP≠B-NonOSE_AE / HUS≠B-NonOSE_AE  is not known  [see Dosage and Administration (     2.3     )   ]  .  

    5.14       Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome

  Cases of  posterior≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reversible≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   encephalopathy≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   syndrome≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  PRES≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ) have been reported in patients receiving Kyprolis.  PRES≠B-NonOSE_AE , formerly termed  Reversible≠B-NonOSE_AE   Posterior≠I-NonOSE_AE   Leukoencephalopathy≠I-NonOSE_AE   Syndrome≠I-NonOSE_AE   (≠I-NonOSE_AE  RPLS≠I-NonOSE_AE ), is a  neurological≠B-NonOSE_AE   disorder≠I-NonOSE_AE  which can present with  seizure≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  headache≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  lethargy≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  confusion≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  blindness≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  altered≠B-NonOSE_AE   consciousness≠I-NonOSE_AE , and other  visual≠B-NonOSE_AE  and neurological  disturbances≠I-NonOSE_AE , along with  hypertension≠B-NonOSE_AE , and the diagnosis is confirmed by neuro-radiological imaging (MRI). Discontinue Kyprolis if  PRES≠B-NonOSE_AE  is suspected and evaluate. The safety of reinitiating Kyprolis therapy in patients previously experiencing  PRES≠B-NonOSE_AE  is not known.

    5.15       Increased Fatal and Serious Toxicities in Combination with Melphalan and Prednisone in Newly Diagnosed Transplant-Ineligible Patients

   In a clinical trial of 955 transplant-ineligible patients with newly diagnosed  multiple≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   myeloma≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  randomized to Kyprolis (20/36 mg/m  2  by 30-minute infusion twice weekly for four of each six-week cycle), melphalan and prednisone (KMP) or bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone (VMP), a higher incidence of  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE  adverse reactions (7% versus  4%) and serious adverse reactions (50% versus  42%) were observed in the KMP arm compared to patients in the VMP arm, respectively. Patients in the KMP arm were observed to have a higher incidence of any grade adverse reactions involving  cardiac≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   failure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (11% versus  4%),  hypertension≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (25% versus  8%),  acute≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   renal≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   failure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (14% versus  6%), and  dyspnea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (18% versus  9%). This study did not meet its primary outcome measure of superiority in progression-free survival for the KMP arm. Kyprolis in combination with melphalan and prednisone is not indicated for transplant-ineligible patients with newly diagnosed  multiple≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   myeloma≠I-Not_AE_Candidate .  

    5.16        Embryo≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  Fetal≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   Toxicity≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE 

  Kyprolis can cause  fetal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   harm≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  when administered to a  pregnant≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  woman based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in  pregnant≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  women using Kyprolis.

 Advise females of reproductive potential to avoid becoming  pregnant≠B-NonOSE_AE  while being treated with Kyprolis.  Advise males of reproductive potential to avoid fathering a child while being treated with Kyprolis.  Advise women who use Kyprolis during  pregnancy≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or become  pregnant≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  during treatment with Kyprolis of the potential  hazard≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   to≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   the≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   fetus≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  [see Use in Specific Populations   (     8.1     ,     8.3     )   ]  .
