    5        WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  

   EXCERPT:    *  Increased Mortality, Myocardial Infarction, Stroke, and Thromboembolism: Using Aranesp to target a hemoglobin level of greater than 11 g/dL increases the risk of serious adverse cardiovascular reactions and has not been shown to provide additional benefit (  5.1  and  14.1  ).  Use caution in patients with coexistent cardiovascular disease and stroke (  5.1  ). 
 *  Increased Mortality and/or Increased Risk of Tumor Progression or Recurrence in Patients with Cancer (  5.2  ). 
 *  Hypertension: Control hypertension prior to initiating and during treatment with Aranesp (  5.3  ). 
 *  Seizures: Aranesp increases the risk for seizures in patients with CKD (  5.4  ).Increase monitoring of these patients for changes in seizure frequency or premonitory symptoms (  5.4  ). 
 *  PRCA: If severe anemia and low reticulocyte count develop during Aranesp treatment, withhold Aranesp and evaluate for PRCA (  5.6  ). 
 *  Serious Allergic Reactions: Discontinue Aranesp and manage reactions (  5.7  ). 
 *  Severe Cutaneous Reactions: Discontinue Aranesp (  5.8  ). 
    
 

   5.1       Increased Mortality, Myocardial Infarction, Stroke, and Thromboembolism

    *  In controlled clinical trials of patients with  CKD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  comparing higher hemoglobin targets (13 - 14 g/dL) to lower targets (9 - 11.3 g/dL), Aranesp and other ESAs increased the risk of  death≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  myocardial≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   infarction≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  stroke≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  congestive≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   heart≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   failure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  thrombosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   hemodialysis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   vascular≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   access≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and other  thromboembolic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   events≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  in the higher target groups. 
 *  Using Aranesp to target a  hemoglobin≠B-NonOSE_AE   level≠I-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   greater≠I-NonOSE_AE   than≠I-NonOSE_AE   1≠I-NonOSE_AE  1≠I-NonOSE_AE   g≠I-NonOSE_AE  /≠I-NonOSE_AE  dL≠I-NonOSE_AE  increases the risk of serious  adverse≠B-NonOSE_AE   cardiovascular≠I-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE  and has not been shown to provide additional benefit [see Clinical Studies (    14.1    )] .  Use caution in patients with coexistent  cardiovascular≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and  stroke≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   [see Dosage and Administration (    2.2    )] .  Patients with  CKD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and an insufficient hemoglobin response to ESA therapy may be at even greater risk for  cardiovascular≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  mortality≠B-NonOSE_AE  than other patients. A rate of  hemoglobin≠B-NonOSE_AE   rise≠I-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   greater≠I-NonOSE_AE   than≠I-NonOSE_AE   1≠I-NonOSE_AE   g≠I-NonOSE_AE  /≠I-NonOSE_AE  dL≠I-NonOSE_AE   over≠I-NonOSE_AE   2≠I-NonOSE_AE   weeks≠I-NonOSE_AE  may contribute to these risks. 
 *  In controlled clinical trials of patients with  cancer≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , Aranesp and other ESAs increased the risks for  death≠B-NonOSE_AE  and serious  adverse≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   cardiovascular≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . These adverse reactions included  myocardial≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   infarction≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  stroke≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . 
 *  In controlled clinical trials, ESAs increased the risk of  death≠B-NonOSE_AE  in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) and the risk of  deep≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   venous≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   thrombosis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (DVT) in patients undergoing orthopedic procedures.

           Patients with   Chronic   Kidney Disease  
 

 Normal Hematocrit Study (NHS): A prospective, randomized, open-label study of 1265 patients with  chronic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   kidney≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  on dialysis with documented evidence of  congestive≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   heart≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   failure≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  or  ischemic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   heart≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  was designed to test the hypothesis that a higher target hematocrit (Hct) would result in improved outcomes compared with a lower target Hct. In this study, patients were randomized to epoetin alfa treatment targeted to a maintenance hemoglobin of either 14 +/- 1 g/dL or 10 +/- 1 g/dL.  The trial was terminated early with adverse safety findings of higher  mortality≠B-NonOSE_AE  in the high hematocrit target group. Higher  mortality≠B-NonOSE_AE  (35% vs. 29%) was observed for the patients randomized to a target hemoglobin of 14 g/dL than for the patients randomized to a target hemoglobin of 10 g/dL.  For all-cause  mortality≠B-NonOSE_AE , the HR = 1.27; 95% CI (1.04, 1.54); p=0.018.  The incidence of  nonfatal≠B-NonOSE_AE   myocardial≠B-NonOSE_AE   infarction≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  vascular≠B-NonOSE_AE   access≠I-NonOSE_AE   thrombosis≠I-NonOSE_AE , and other  thrombotic≠B-NonOSE_AE   events≠I-NonOSE_AE  was also higher in the group randomized to a target hemoglobin of 14 g/dL.

 CHOIR: A randomized, prospective trial, 1432 patients with  anemia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   due≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   to≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   CKD≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  who were not undergoing dialysis and who had not previously received epoetin alfa therapy were randomized to epoetin alfa treatment targeting a maintenance hemoglobin concentration of either 13.5 g/dL or 11.3 g/dL.  The trial was terminated early with adverse safety findings. A  major≠B-NonOSE_AE   cardiovascular≠I-NonOSE_AE   event≠I-NonOSE_AE  ( death≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  myocardial≠B-NonOSE_AE   infarction≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  stroke≠B-NonOSE_AE , or hospitalization for  congestive≠B-NonOSE_AE   heart≠I-NonOSE_AE   failure≠I-NonOSE_AE ) occurred in 125 of the 715 patients (18%) in the higher hemoglobin group compared to 97 of the 717 patients (14%) in the lower hemoglobin group [hazard ratio (HR) 1.34, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.74; p = 0.03].

 TREAT: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, prospective trial of 4038 patients with  CKD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  not on dialysis (eGFR of 20 - 60 mL/min),  anemia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  ( hemoglobin≠B-NonOSE_AE   levels≠I-NonOSE_AE   <≠I-NonOSE_AE  =≠I-NonOSE_AE   1≠I-NonOSE_AE  1≠I-NonOSE_AE   g≠I-NonOSE_AE  /≠I-NonOSE_AE  dL≠I-NonOSE_AE ), and  type≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   2≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   diabetes≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   mellitus≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , patients were randomized to receive either Aranesp treatment or a matching placebo.  Placebo group patients also received Aranesp when their hemoglobin levels were below 9 g/dL.  The trial objectives were to demonstrate the benefit of Aranesp treatment of the  anemia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  to a target hemoglobin level of 13 g/dL, when compared to a "placebo" group, by reducing the occurrence of either of two primary endpoints: (1) a composite cardiovascular endpoint of all-cause  mortality≠B-NonOSE_AE  or a specified  cardiovascular≠B-NonOSE_AE   event≠I-NonOSE_AE  ( myocardial≠B-NonOSE_AE   ischemia≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  CHF≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  MI≠B-NonOSE_AE , and  CVA≠B-NonOSE_AE ) or (2) a composite renal endpoint of all-cause  mortality≠B-NonOSE_AE  or progression to  end≠B-NonOSE_AE   stage≠I-NonOSE_AE   renal≠I-NonOSE_AE   disease≠I-NonOSE_AE .  The overall risks for each of the two primary endpoints (the cardiovascular composite and the renal composite) were not reduced with Aranesp treatment (see Table3), but the risk of  stroke≠B-NonOSE_AE  was increased nearly two-fold in the Aranesp-treated group versus the placebo group: annualized  stroke≠B-NonOSE_AE  rate 2.1% vs. 1.1%, respectively, HR 1.92; 95% CI: 1.38, 2.68; p < 0.001. The relative risk of  stroke≠B-NonOSE_AE  was particularly high in patients with a prior  stroke≠B-Not_AE_Candidate : annualized  stroke≠B-NonOSE_AE  rate 5.2% in the Aranesp treated group and 1.9% in the placebo group, HR 3.07; 95% CI: 1.44, 6.54.  Also, among Aranesp-treated subjects with a past history of  cancer≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , there were more  deaths≠B-NonOSE_AE  due to all causes and more  deaths≠B-NonOSE_AE  adjudicated as due to  cancer≠B-NonOSE_AE , in comparison with the control group.

  Patients with Cancer  

 An increased incidence of  thromboembolic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , some serious and life-threatening, occurred in patients with  cancer≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  treated with ESAs.

 In a randomized, placebo-controlled study (Study 2 in Table 4  [   see Warnings and Precautions (     5.2     )   ]  ) of 939 women with  metastatic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   breast≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  receiving chemotherapy, patients received either weekly epoetin alfa or placebo for up to a year. This study was designed to show that survival was superior when epoetin alfa was administered to prevent  anemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  (maintain hemoglobin levels between 12 and 14 g/dL or hematocrit between 36% and 42%). This study was terminated prematurely when interim results demonstrated a higher  mortality≠B-NonOSE_AE  at 4 months (8.7% vs. 3.4%) and a higher rate of  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE   thrombotic≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE  (1.1% vs. 0.2%) in the first 4 months of the study among patients treated with epoetin alfa. Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates, at the time of study termination, the 12-month survival was lower in the epoetin alfa group than in the placebo group (70% vs. 76%; HR 1.37, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.75; p = 0.012).

  Patients Having Surgery  

 Aranesp     is not approved for reduction of RBC transfusions in patients scheduled for surgical procedures.

 An increased incidence of  DVT≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  in patients receiving epoetin alfa undergoing surgical orthopedic procedures was demonstrated. In a randomized, controlled study, 680 adult patients, not receiving prophylactic anticoagulation and undergoing spinal surgery, received epoetin alfa and standard of care (SOC) treatment (n = 340) or SOC treatment alone (n = 340).  A higher incidence of  DVTs≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , determined by either color flow duplex imaging or by clinical symptoms, was observed in the epoetin alfa group (16 [4.7%] patients) compared with the SOC group (7 [2.1%] patients). In addition to the 23 patients with  DVTs≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  included in the primary analysis, 19 [2.8%] patients experienced 1 other  thrombovascular≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   event≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  TVE≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ) each (12 [3.5%] in the epoetin alfa group and 7 [2.1%] in the SOC group).

 Increased  mortality≠B-NonOSE_AE  was observed in a randomized, placebo-controlled study of epoetin alfa in adult patients who were undergoing CABG surgery (7  deaths≠B-NonOSE_AE  in 126 patients randomized to epoetin alfa versus no  deaths≠B-NonOSE_AE  among 56 patients receiving placebo). Four of these  deaths≠B-NonOSE_AE  occurred during the period of study drug administration and all 4  deaths≠B-NonOSE_AE  were associated with  thrombotic≠B-NonOSE_AE   events≠I-NonOSE_AE .

    5.2       Increased Mortality and/or Increased Risk of  Tumor≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   Progression≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  or Recurrence in Patients with Cancer

  ESAs resulted in decreased locoregional control/progression-free survival (PFS) and/or overall survival (OS) (see Table 4).  

  Adverse effects on PFS and/or OS were observed in studies of patients receiving chemotherapy for  breast≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  (Studies 1, 2, and 4),  lymphoid≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   malignancy≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  (Study 3), and  cervical≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  (Study 5); in patients with advanced  head≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   and≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   neck≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  receiving radiation therapy (Studies 6 and 7), and in patients with  non≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  small≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   cell≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   lung≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  or various malignancies who were not receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy (Studies 8 and 9).

 This study did not include a defined hemoglobin target. Doses were titrated to achieve and maintain the lowest hemoglobin level sufficient to avoid transfusion and not to exceed 12 g/dL.

  Decreased Overall Survival  

 Study 2 was described in the previous section     [   see Warnings and Precautions (     5.1     )   ]  .  Mortality≠B-NonOSE_AE  at 4 months (8.7% vs. 3.4%) was significantly higher in the epoetin alfa arm. The most common investigator-attributed cause of  death≠B-NonOSE_AE  within the first 4 months was disease progression; 28 of 41  deaths≠B-NonOSE_AE  in the epoetin alfa arm and 13 of 16  deaths≠B-NonOSE_AE  in the placebo arm were attributed to disease progression. Investigator-assessed time to  tumor≠B-NonOSE_AE   progression≠I-NonOSE_AE  was not different between the 2 groups. Survival at 12 months was significantly lower in the epoetin alfa arm (70% vs. 76%; HR 1.37, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.75; p = 0.012).

 Study 3 was a randomized, double-blind study (darbepoetin alfa vs. placebo)     conducted in 344  anemic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  patients with  lymphoid≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   malignancy≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  receiving chemotherapy.  With a median follow-up of 29 months, overall  mortality≠B-NonOSE_AE  rates were significantly higher among patients randomized to darbepoetin alfa as compared to placebo (HR 1.36, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.82).

 Study 8 was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind study (epoetin alfa vs. placebo) in which patients with  advanced≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   non≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  small≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   cell≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   lung≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  receiving only palliative radiotherapy or no active therapy were treated with epoetin alfa to achieve and maintain hemoglobin levels between 12 and 14 g/dL. Following an interim analysis of 70 patients (planned accrual 300 patients), a significant difference in survival in favor of the patients in the placebo arm of the study was observed (median survival 63 vs. 129 days; HR 1.84; p = 0.04).

 Study 9 was a randomized, double-blind study (darbepoetin alfa vs. placebo) in 989  anemic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  patients with  active≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   malignant≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , neither receiving nor planning to receive chemotherapy or radiation therapy. There was no evidence of a statistically significant reduction in proportion of patients receiving RBC transfusions. The median survival was shorter in the darbepoetin alfa treatment group than in the placebo group (8 months vs. 10.8 months; HR 1.30, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.57).

  Decreased Progression  - free Survival and   Overall Survival  

  Study 1 was a randomized, open-label, multicenter study in 2,098  anemic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  women with  metastatic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   breast≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , who received first line or second line chemotherapy. This was a non inferiority study designed to rule out a 15% risk increase in  tumor≠B-NonOSE_AE   progression≠I-NonOSE_AE  or  death≠B-NonOSE_AE  of epoetin alfa plus standard of care (SOC) as compared with SOC alone. The median progression free survival (PFS) per investigator assessment of disease progression was 7.4 months in each arm (HR 1.09, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.20), indicating the study objective was not met. At the time of clinical data cutoff, 1337  deaths≠B-NonOSE_AE  were reported. Median overall survival in the epoetin alfa plus SOC group was 17.2 months compared with 17.4 months in the SOC alone group (HR 1.06, 95% CI: 0.95, 1.18). There were more  deaths≠B-NonOSE_AE  from disease progression in the epoetin alfa plus SOC arm (59% vs. 56%) and more  thrombotic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   vascular≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   events≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  in the epoetin alfa plus SOC arm (3% vs. 1%).  

 Study 4 was a randomized, open-label, controlled, factorial design study in which darbepoetin alfa was administered to prevent  anemia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  in 733 women receiving neo-adjuvant  breast≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  treatment. A final analysis was performed after a median follow-up of approximately 3 years. The 3-year survival rate was lower (86% vs. 90%; HR 1.42, 95% CI: 0.93, 2.18) and the 3-year relapse-free survival rate was lower (72% vs. 78%; HR 1.33, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.79) in the darbepoetin alfa-treated arm compared to the control arm.

 Study 5 was a randomized, open-label, controlled study that enrolled 114 of a planned 460 patients with  cervical≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  receiving chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive epoetin alfa to maintain hemoglobin between 12 and 14 g/dL or to RBC transfusion support as needed. The study was terminated prematurely due to an increase in  thromboembolic≠B-NonOSE_AE   adverse≠I-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE  in epoetin alfa-treated patients compared to control (19% vs. 9%). Both local recurrence (21% vs. 20%) and distant recurrence (12% vs. 7%) were more frequent in epoetin alfa-treated patients compared to control. Progression-free survival at 3 years was lower in the epoetin alfa-treated group compared to control (59% vs. 62%; HR 1.06, 95% CI: 0.58, 1.91).  Overall survival at 3 years was lower in the epoetin alfa-treated group compared to control (61% vs. 71%; HR 1.28, 95% CI: 0.68, 2.42).

 Study 6 was a randomized, placebo-controlled study in 351 patients with  head≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   and≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   neck≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  where epoetin beta or placebo was administered to achieve target hemoglobins >= 14 and >= 15 g/dL for women and men, respectively. Locoregional progression-free survival was significantly shorter in patients receiving epoetin beta (HR 1.62, 95% CI: 1.22, 2.14; p = 0.0008) with medians of 406 days and 745 days in the epoetin beta and placebo arms respectively. Overall survival was significantly shorter in patients receiving epoetin beta (HR 1.39, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.84; p = 0.02).

  Decreased Locoregional C   ontrol  

 Study 7 was a randomized, open-label, controlled study conducted in 522 patients with  primary≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   squamous≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   cell≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   carcinoma≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  of the head and neck receiving radiation therapy alone (no chemotherapy) who were randomized to receive darbepoetin alfa to maintain hemoglobin levels of 14 to15.5 g/dL or no darbepoetin alfa. An interim analysis performed on 484 patients demonstrated that locoregional control at 5 years was significantly shorter in patients receiving darbepoetin alfa (RR 1.44, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.96; p = 0.02). Overall survival was shorter in patients receiving darbepoetin alfa     (RR 1.28, 95% CI: 0.98, 1.68; p = 0.08).

    5.3        Hypertension≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE 

  Aranesp is contraindicated in patients with  uncontrolled≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   hypertension≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . In Aranesp clinical studies, approximately 40% of patients with  CKD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  required initiation or intensification of antihypertensive therapy during the early phase of treatment.  Hypertensive≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   encephalopathy≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  seizures≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported in patients with  CKD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  receiving Aranesp.

 Appropriately control  hypertension≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  prior to initiation of and during treatment with Aranesp. Reduce or withhold Aranesp if blood pressure becomes     difficult to control. Advise patients of the importance of compliance with antihypertensive therapy and dietary restrictions [   see Patient Counseling Information (     17     )   ]  .

    5.4       Seizures

  Aranesp increases the risk of  seizures≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  in patients with  CKD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate . During the first several months following initiation of Aranesp, monitor patients closely for  premonitory≠B-NonOSE_AE   neurologic≠I-NonOSE_AE   symptoms≠I-NonOSE_AE . Advise patients to contact their healthcare practitioner for new-onset  seizures≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  premonitory≠B-NonOSE_AE   symptoms≠I-NonOSE_AE , or change in  seizure≠B-NonOSE_AE  frequency.

    5.5       Lack or Loss of Hemoglobin Response to Aranesp

  For lack or loss of hemoglobin response to Aranesp, initiate a search for causative factors (e.g.,  iron≠B-NonOSE_AE   deficiency≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  infection≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  inflammation≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  bleeding≠B-NonOSE_AE ). If typical causes of lack or loss of hemoglobin response are excluded, evaluate for  PRCA≠B-NonOSE_AE  [   see Warnings and Precautions (     5.6     )   ]  . In the absence of  PRCA≠B-NonOSE_AE , follow dosing recommendations for management of patients with an insufficient hemoglobin response to Aranesp therapy [see Dosage and   Administration   (     2.2     )]  .

    5.6        Pure≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   Red≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   Cell≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   Aplasia≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE 

  Cases of  PRCA≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and of severe  anemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , with or without other  cytopenias≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  that arise following the development of  neutralizing≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   antibodies≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   to≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   erythropoietin≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported in patients treated with Aranesp. This has been reported predominantly in patients with  CKD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  receiving ESAs by subcutaneous administration.  PRCA≠B-NonOSE_AE  has also been reported in patients receiving ESAs for  anemia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  related to  hepatitis≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   C≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  treatment (an indication for which Aranesp is not approved).

 If severe  anemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  and  low≠B-NonOSE_AE   reticulocyte≠I-NonOSE_AE   count≠I-NonOSE_AE  develop during treatment with Aranesp, withhold Aranesp and evaluate patients for  neutralizing≠B-NonOSE_AE   antibodies≠I-NonOSE_AE   to≠I-NonOSE_AE   erythropoietin≠I-NonOSE_AE . Contact Amgen (1-800-77-AMGEN) to perform assays for binding and  neutralizing≠B-NonOSE_AE   antibodies≠I-NonOSE_AE .  Permanently discontinue Aranesp in patients who develop  PRCA≠B-NonOSE_AE  following treatment with Aranesp or other erythropoietin protein drugs. Do not switch patients to other ESAs.

    5.7       Serious Allergic Reactions

  Serious  allergic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , including  anaphylactic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  angioedema≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  bronchospasm≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  skin≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   rash≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  urticaria≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  may occur with Aranesp.  Immediately and permanently discontinue Aranesp and administer appropriate therapy if a serious  allergic≠B-NonOSE_AE  or  anaphylactic≠B-NonOSE_AE   reaction≠I-NonOSE_AE  occurs.

    5.8 Severe  Cutaneous≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   Reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE 

    Blistering≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  skin≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   exfoliation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  including  Erythema≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   multiforme≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  Stevens≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  Johnson≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   Syndrome≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  SJS≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE )/ Toxic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   Epidermal≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   Necrolysis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  TEN≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ), have been reported in patients treated with ESAs (including Aranesp) in the post-marketing setting. Discontinue Aranesp therapy immediately if a severe  cutaneous≠B-NonOSE_AE   reaction≠I-NonOSE_AE , such as  SJS≠B-NonOSE_AE / TEN≠B-NonOSE_AE , is suspected.  

    5.9       Dialysis Management

  Patients may require adjustments in their dialysis prescriptions after initiation of Aranesp. Patients receiving Aranesp may require increased anticoagulation with heparin to prevent  clotting≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   the≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   extracorporeal≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   circuit≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  during hemodialysis.
