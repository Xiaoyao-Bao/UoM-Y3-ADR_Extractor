    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *  Myelosuppression: ISTODAX can cause thrombocytopenia, leukopenia (neutropenia and lymphopenia), and anemia; monitor blood counts during treatment with ISTODAX; interrupt and/or modify the dose as necessary (  2.2  ). 
 *  Infections: Fatal and serious infections. Reactivation of DNA viruses (Epstein Barr and hepatitis B). Consider monitoring and prophylaxis in patients with evidence of prior hepatitis B (  5.2  ). 
 *  Electrocardiographic (ECG) changes: Consider cardiovascular monitoring in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, a history of significant cardiovascular disease, and patients taking medicinal products that lead to significant QT prolongation. Ensure that potassium and magnesium are within the normal range before administration of ISTODAX (  5.3  ). 
 *  Tumor lysis syndrome: Patients with advanced stage disease and/or high tumor burden are at greater risk and should be closely monitored and appropriate precautions taken (  5.4  ). 
 *  Embryo-fetal toxicity: ISTODAX may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of potential hazard to the fetus and to avoid pregnancy while receiving ISTODAX (  5.5  ,  8.1  ). 
    
 

   5.1  Myelosuppression≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE 



  Treatment with ISTODAX can cause  thrombocytopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  leukopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  ( neutropenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  lymphopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ), and  anemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . Monitor blood counts regularly during treatment with ISTODAX, and modify the dose as necessary [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  and  Adverse Reactions (6)  ].  



    5.2 Infections



    Fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE  and serious  infections≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , including  pneumonia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  sepsis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  viral≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactivation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , including Epstein Barr and hepatitis B viruses, have been reported in clinical trials with ISTODAX. These can occur during treatment and within 30 days after treatment. The risk of life threatening infections may be greater in patients with a history of prior treatment with monoclonal antibodies directed against lymphocyte antigens and in patients with  disease≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   involvement≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   of≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   the≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   bone≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   marrow≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  [see  Adverse Reactions (6)  ].    



   Reactivation≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   hepatitis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   B≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   virus≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infection≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  has occurred in 1% of  PTCL≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  patients in clinical trials in Western populations [see  Adverse Reactions (6)  ]  . In patients with evidence of prior  hepatitis≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   B≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   infection≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , consider monitoring for reactivation, and consider antiviral prophylaxis.  



   Reactivation≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  of  Epstein≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   Barr≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   viral≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infection≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  leading to  liver≠B-NonOSE_AE   failure≠I-NonOSE_AE  has occurred in a trial of patients with relapsed or refractory extranodal NK/ T≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  cell≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   lymphoma≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . In one case, ganciclovir prophylaxis failed to prevent  Epstein≠B-NonOSE_AE   Barr≠I-NonOSE_AE   viral≠I-NonOSE_AE   reactivation≠I-NonOSE_AE .  



    5.3 Electrocardiographic Changes



  Several treatment-emergent morphological  changes≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   ECGs≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (including  T≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  wave≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and ST-segment  changes≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ) have been reported in clinical studies. The clinical significance of these changes is unknown [see  Adverse Reactions (6)  ].  



 In patients with  congenital≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   long≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   QT≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   syndrome≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , patients with a history of significant  cardiovascular≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , and patients taking anti-arrhythmic medicines or medicinal products that lead to significant  QT≠B-NonOSE_AE   prolongation≠I-NonOSE_AE , consider cardiovascular monitoring of ECGs at baseline and periodically during treatment.



 Confirm that potassium and magnesium levels are within normal range before administration of ISTODAX [see  Adverse Reactions (6)  ].  



    5.4 Tumor Lysis Syndrome



   Tumor≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   lysis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   syndrome≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  TLS≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ) has been reported to occur in 1% of patients with  tumor≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  stage  CTCL≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and 2% of patients with Stage III/IV  PTCL≠B-Not_AE_Candidate . Patients with advanced stage disease and/or high  tumor≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  burden may be at greater risk, should be closely monitored, and managed as appropriate.



    5.5 Use in Pregnancy



  There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of ISTODAX in  pregnant≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  women. However, based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, ISTODAX may cause  fetal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   harm≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  when administered to a  pregnant≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  woman. In an animal reproductive study, romidepsin was  embryocidal≠B-NonOSE_AE  and resulted in adverse  effects≠B-NonOSE_AE   on≠I-NonOSE_AE   the≠I-NonOSE_AE   developing≠I-NonOSE_AE   fetus≠I-NonOSE_AE  at exposures below those in patients at the recommended dose of 14 mg/m  2  /week. If this drug is used during  pregnancy≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , or if the patient becomes  pregnant≠B-NonOSE_AE  while taking ISTODAX, the patient should be apprised of the potential  hazard≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   to≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   the≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   fetus≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ]  .
