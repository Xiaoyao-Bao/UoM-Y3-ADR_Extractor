  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

 The data in the Warnings and Precautions section reflect exposure to XALKORI in 1719 patients who received XALKORI 250 mg twice daily enrolled on Studies 1 (including an additional 109 patients who crossed over from the control arm), 2, 3, a single arm trial (n=1063) of  ALK≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  positive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   NSCLC≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , and an additional  ALK≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  positive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   NSCLC≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  expansion cohort of a dose finding study (n=154)  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5)  ]  .

 The data described below is based primarily on 343 patients with  ALK≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  positive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   metastatic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   NSCLC≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  who received XALKORI 250 mg twice daily from 2 open-label, randomized, active-controlled trials (Studies 1 and 2). The safety of XALKORI was also evaluated in 50 patients with ROS1-positive  metastatic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   NSCLC≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  from a single-arm study (Study 3).

 The most common adverse reactions (>=25%) of XALKORI are  vision≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   disorders≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  nausea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  diarrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  vomiting≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  edema≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  constipation≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  elevated≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   transaminases≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  fatigue≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  decreased≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   appetite≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  upper≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   respiratory≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infection≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  dizziness≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  neuropathy≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .

     Previously Untreated ALK-Positive Metastatic NSCLC - Study 1  

 The data in Table 3 are derived from 340 patients with  ALK≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  positive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  metastatic  NSCLC≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  who had not received previous systemic treatment for advanced disease who received treatment in a randomized, multicenter, open-label, active-controlled trial (Study 1). Patients in the XALKORI arm (n=171) received XALKORI 250 mg orally twice daily until documented disease progression, intolerance to therapy, or the investigator determined that the patient was no longer experiencing clinical benefit. A total of 169 patients in the chemotherapy arm received pemetrexed 500 mg/m  2  in combination with cisplatin 75 mg/m  2  (n=91) or carboplatin at a dose calculated to produce an area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of 5 or 6 mg min/mL (n=78). Chemotherapy was given by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks for up to 6 cycles, in the absence of dose-limiting chemotherapy-related toxicities. After 6 cycles, patients remained on study with no additional anticancer treatment, and tumor assessments continued until documented disease progression.

 The median duration of study treatment was 10.9 months for patients in the XALKORI arm and 4.1 months for patients in the chemotherapy arm. Median duration of treatment was 5.2 months for patients who received XALKORI after cross over from chemotherapy. Across the 340 patients who were treated in Study 1, the median age was 53 years; 16% of patients were older than 65 years. A total of 62% of patients were female and 46% were Asian.

 Serious adverse events were reported in 58 patients (34%) treated with XALKORI. The most frequent serious adverse events reported in patients treated with XALKORI were  dyspnea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (4.1%) and  pulmonary≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   embolism≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (2.9%). Fatal adverse events in XALKORI-treated patients occurred in 2.3% patients, consisting of  septic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   shock≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  acute≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   respiratory≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   failure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  diabetic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   ketoacidosis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE .

 Dose reductions due to adverse reactions were required in 6.4% of XALKORI-treated patients. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to dose reduction in these patients were  nausea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (1.8%) and  elevated≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   transaminases≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (1.8%).

 Permanent discontinuation of XALKORI treatment for adverse reactions was 8.2%. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to permanent discontinuation in XALKORI-treated patients were  elevated≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   transaminases≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (1.2%),  hepatotoxicity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (1.2%), and  ILD≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (1.2%).

 Tables 3 and 4 summarize common adverse reactions and  laboratory≠B-NonOSE_AE   abnormalities≠I-NonOSE_AE  in XALKORI-treated patients.

               Previously Treated ALK-Positive Metastatic NSCLC - Study 2  
 

 The data in Table 5 are derived from 343 patients with  ALK≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  positive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   metastatic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   NSCLC≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  enrolled in a randomized, multicenter, active-controlled, open-label trial (Study 2). Patients in the XALKORI arm (n=172) received XALKORI 250 mg orally twice daily until documented disease progression, intolerance to therapy, or the investigator determined that the patient was no longer experiencing clinical benefit. A total of 171 patients in the chemotherapy arm received pemetrexed 500 mg/m  2  (n=99) or docetaxel 75 mg/m  2  (n=72) by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks until documented disease progression, intolerance to therapy, or the investigator determined that the patient was no longer experiencing clinical benefit. Patients in the chemotherapy arm received pemetrexed unless they had received pemetrexed as part of first-line or maintenance treatment.

 The median duration of study treatment was 7.1 months for patients who received XALKORI and 2.8 months for patients who received chemotherapy. Across the 347 patients who were randomized to study treatment (343 received at least 1 dose of study treatment), the median age was 50 years; 14% of patients were older than 65 years. A total of 56% of patients were female and 45% of patients were Asian.

 Serious adverse reactions were reported in 64 patients (37.2%) treated with XALKORI and 40 patients (23.4%) in the chemotherapy arm. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in patients treated with XALKORI were  pneumonia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (4.1%),  pulmonary≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   embolism≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (3.5%),  dyspnea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (2.3%), and  ILD≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (2.9%).  Fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE  adverse reactions in XALKORI-treated patients in Study 2 occurred in 9 (5%) patients, consisting of:  acute≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   respiratory≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   distress≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   syndrome≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  arrhythmia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  dyspnea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  pneumonia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  pneumonitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  pulmonary≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   embolism≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  ILD≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  respiratory≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   failure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  sepsis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .

 Dose reductions due to adverse reactions were required in 16% of XALKORI-treated patients. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to dose reduction in the patients treated with XALKORI were  ALT≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   elevation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (7.6%) including some patients with concurrent  AST≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   elevation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  QTc≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   prolongation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (2.9%), and  neutropenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (2.3%).

 XALKORI was discontinued for adverse reactions in 15% of patients. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to discontinuation of XALKORI were  ILD≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (1.7%),  ALT≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and AST  elevation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (1.2%),  dyspnea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (1.2%), and  pulmonary≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   embolism≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (1.2%).

               ROS1-Positive Metastatic NSCLC - Study 3  
 

 The safety profile of XALKORI from Study 3, which was evaluated in 50 patients with ROS1-positive  metastatic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   NSCLC≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , was generally consistent with the safety profile of XALKORI evaluated in patients with  ALK≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  positive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   metastatic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   NSCLC≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  (n=1669).  Vision≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   disorders≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred in 92% of patients in Study 3; 90% were Grade 1 and 2% were Grade 2. The median duration of exposure to XALKORI was 34.4 months.

     Description of Selected Adverse Drug Reactions  

     Vision disorders  

  Vision≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   disorders≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , most commonly  visual≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   impairment≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  photopsia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  blurred≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   vision≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , or  vitreous≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   floaters≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , occurred in 1084 (63.1%) of 1719 patients. The majority (95%) of these patients had Grade 1  visual≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   adverse≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . There were 13 (0.8%) patients with Grade 3 and 4 (0.2%) patients with Grade 4  visual≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   impairment≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE .

 Based on the Visual Symptom Assessment Questionnaire (VSAQ-ALK), patients treated with XALKORI in Studies 1 and 2 reported a higher incidence of  visual≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   disturbances≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  compared to patients treated with chemotherapy. The onset of  vision≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   disorder≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  generally was within the first week of drug administration. The majority of patients on the XALKORI arms in Studies 1 and 2 (>50%) reported  visual≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   disturbances≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  which occurred at a frequency of 4-7 days each week, lasted up to 1 minute, and had mild or no impact (scores 0 to 3 out of a maximum score of 10) on daily activities as captured in the VSAQ-ALK questionnaire.

     Neuropathy  

  Neuropathy≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , most commonly sensory in nature, occurred in 435 (25%) of 1719 patients. Most events (95%) were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity.

     Renal cysts  

  Renal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   cysts≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  were experienced by 52 (3%) of 1719 patients.

 The majority of  renal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   cysts≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  in XALKORI-treated patients were complex.  Local≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   cystic≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   invasion≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   beyond≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   the≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   kidney≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred, in some cases with imaging characteristics suggestive of  abscess≠B-NonOSE_AE  formation. However, across clinical trials no  renal≠B-NonOSE_AE   abscesses≠I-NonOSE_AE  were confirmed by microbiology tests.

      Renal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   impairment≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   

 The estimated  glomerular≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   filtration≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   rate≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  eGFR≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  )≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   decreased≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  from a baseline median of 96.42 mL/min/1.73 m  2  (n=1681) to a median of 80.23 mL/min/1.73 m  2  at 2 weeks (n=1499) in patients with  ALK≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  positive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  advanced  NSCLC≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  who received XALKORI in clinical trials. No clinically relevant changes occurred in median eGFR from 12 to 104 weeks of treatment. Median  eGFR≠B-NonOSE_AE   slightly≠I-NonOSE_AE   increased≠I-NonOSE_AE  (83.02 mL/min/1.73 m  2  ) 4 weeks after the last dose of XALKORI. Overall, 76% of patients had a  decrease≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   eGFR≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  to <90 mL/min/1.73 m  2  , 38% had a  decrease≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  to  eGFR≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  to <60 mL/min/1.73 m  2  , and 3.6% had a  decrease≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  to  eGFR≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  to <30 mL/min/1.73 m  2  .
