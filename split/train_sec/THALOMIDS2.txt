   If thalidomide is taken during  pregnancy≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , it can cause severe  birth≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   defects≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  or  embryo≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  fetal≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   death≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . Thalidomide should never be used by females who are  pregnant≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or who could become  pregnant≠B-NonOSE_AE  while taking the drug. Even a single dose [1 capsule (regardless of strength)] taken by a  pregnant≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  woman during her  pregnancy≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  can cause severe  birth≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   defects≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE .  

   Because of this toxicity and in an effort to make the chance of  embryo≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  fetal≠I-NonOSE_AE   exposure≠I-NonOSE_AE   to≠I-NonOSE_AE   THALOMID≠I-NonOSE_AE   (r)   (thalidomide) as negligible as possible, THALOMID  (r)   (thalidomide) is approved for marketing only through a special restricted distribution program: THALOMID REMS  (r)   program, approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

   VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM  

   The use of THALOMID  (r)   (thalidomide) in  multiple≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   myeloma≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  results in an increased risk of  venous≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   thromboembolism≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , such as  deep≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   venous≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   thrombosis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  pulmonary≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   embolism≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE .  This risk increases significantly when thalidomide is used in combination with standard chemotherapeutic agents including dexamethasone. In one controlled trial, the rate of  venous≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   thromboembolism≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  was 22.5% in patients receiving thalidomide in combination with dexamethasone compared to 4.9% in patients receiving dexamethasone alone (p = 0.002). Patients and physicians are advised to be observant for the signs and symptoms of  thromboembolism≠B-NonOSE_AE . Instruct patients to seek medical care if they develop symptoms such as  shortness≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   breath≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  chest≠B-NonOSE_AE   pain≠I-NonOSE_AE , or  arm≠B-NonOSE_AE  or leg  swelling≠I-NonOSE_AE . Consider thromboprophylaxis based on an assessment of individual patients' underlying risk factors.

   EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY  

 *  If thalidomide is taken during pregnancy, it can cause severe birth defects or embryo-fetal death. Thalidomide should never be used by females who are pregnant or who could be pregnant while taking the drug. Even a single dose [1 capsule (regardless of strength)] taken by a pregnant woman during her pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. 
 *  Pregnancy must be excluded before start of treatment. Prevent pregnancy thereafter by the use of two reliable methods of contraception. (5.1, 8.3) 
      THALOMID  (r)   (thalidomide) is only available through a restricted distribution program, the THALOMID REMS  (r)   program (  5.2  ).  
 

   VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM  

 *  Significant increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients with multiple myeloma receiving THALOMID(r) (thalidomide) with dexamethasone (5.3).
