    6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

  LABA, such as vilanterol, one of the active ingredients in ANORO ELLIPTA, increase the risk of  asthma≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE -related  death≠B-NonOSE_AE . ANORO ELLIPTA is not indicated for the treatment of  asthma≠B-Not_AE_Candidate .  [See Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1).]  



 The following adverse reactions are described in greater detail in other sections:



 *     Paradoxical≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   bronchospasm≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]  
 *     Cardiovascular≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   effects≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]  
 *    Worsening of  narrow≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  angle≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   glaucoma≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]  
 *    Worsening of  urinary≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   retention≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]  
      EXCERPT:   Most common adverse reactions (incidence >=1% and more common than placebo) include pharyngitis, sinusitis, lower respiratory tract infection, constipation, diarrhea, pain in extremity, muscle spasms, neck pain, and chest pain. (  6.1  )

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The clinical program for ANORO ELLIPTA included 8,138 subjects with  COPD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  in four 6-month lung function trials, one 12-month long-term safety study, and 9 other trials of shorter duration. A total of 1,124 subjects have received at least 1 dose of ANORO ELLIPTA (umeclidinium/vilanterol 62.5 mcg/25 mcg), and 1,330 subjects have received a higher dose of umeclidinium/vilanterol (125 mcg/25 mcg). The safety data described below are based on the four 6-month and the one 12-month trials. Adverse reactions observed in the other trials were similar to those observed in the confirmatory trials.



   6-Month Trials:  The incidence of adverse reactions associated with ANORO ELLIPTA in Table 1 is based on four 6-month trials: 2 placebo-controlled trials (Trials 1 and 2; n = 1,532 and n = 1,489, respectively) and 2 active-controlled trials (Trials 3 and 4; n = 843 and n = 869, respectively). Of the 4,733 subjects, 68% were male and 84% were Caucasian. They had a mean age of 63 years and an average smoking history of 45 pack-years, with 50% identified as current smokers. At screening, the mean post-bronchodilator percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was 48% (range: 13% to 76%), the mean post-bronchodilator FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio was 0.47 (range: 0.13 to 0.78), and the mean percent reversibility was 14% (range: -45% to 109%).



 Subjects received 1 dose once daily of the following: ANORO ELLIPTA, umeclidinium/vilanterol 125 mcg/25 mcg, umeclidinium 62.5 mcg, umeclidinium 125 mcg, vilanterol 25 mcg, active control, or placebo.

   12-Month Trial:  In a long-term safety trial, 335 subjects were treated for up to 12 months with umeclidinium/vilanterol 125 mcg/25 mcg or placebo. The demographic and baseline characteristics of the long-term safety trial were similar to those of the placebo-controlled efficacy trials described above. Adverse reactions that occurred with a frequency of greater than or equal to 1% in the group receiving umeclidinium/vilanterol 125 mcg/25 mcg that exceeded that in placebo in this trial were:  headache≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  back≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  sinusitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  cough≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  urinary≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   tract≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infection≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  arthralgia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  nausea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  vertigo≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  abdominal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  pleuritic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  viral≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   respiratory≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   tract≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infection≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  toothache≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  diabetes≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   mellitus≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE .
