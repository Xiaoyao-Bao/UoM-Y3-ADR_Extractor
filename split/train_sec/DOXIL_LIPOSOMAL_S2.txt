    WARNING: CARDIOMYOPATHY and INFUSION-RELATED REACTIONS  

    *  DOXIL (doxorubicin HCl liposome injection) can cause  myocardial≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   damage≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , including  congestive≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   heart≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   failure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , as the total cumulative dose of doxorubicin HCl approaches 550 mg/m2. In a clinical study of 250 patients with advanced  cancer≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  who were treated with DOXIL, the risk of  cardiotoxicity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was 11% when the cumulative anthracycline dose was between 450-550 mg/m2. Prior use of other anthracyclines or anthracenediones should be included in calculations of total cumulative dosage. The risk of  cardiomyopathy≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  may be increased at lower cumulative doses in patients with prior mediastinal irradiation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

   See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.  

 *  Myocardial damage may lead to congestive heart failure and may occur as the total cumulative dose of doxorubicin HCl approaches 550 mg/m2. The risk of cardiomyopathy may be increased at lower cumulative doses with mediastinal irradiation (5.1). 
 *  Acute infusion-related reactions occurred in 11% of patients with solid tumors. Serious, life-threatening, and fatal infusion reactions have been reported. Medications/emergency equipment to treat such reactions should be available for immediate use (5.2).
