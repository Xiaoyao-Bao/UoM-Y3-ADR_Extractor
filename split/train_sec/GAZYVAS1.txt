  6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The data described in Tables 3-6 below are based on a safety population of 773 previously untreated patients with  CLL≠B-Not_AE_Candidate . Patients were treated with chlorambucil alone, GAZYVA in combination with chlorambucil, or rituximab in combination with chlorambucil. The Stage 1 analysis compared GAZYVA in combination with chlorambucil vs. chlorambucil alone, and Stage 2 compared GAZYVA in combination with chlorambucil vs. rituximab in combination with chlorambucil. Patients received three 1000 mg doses of GAZYVA on the first cycle and a single dose of 1000 mg once every 28 days for 5 additional cycles in combination with chlorambucil (6 cycles of 28 days each in total). In the last 140 patients enrolled, the first dose of GAZYVA was split between day 1 (100 mg) and day 2 (900 mg)  [see  Dosage and Administration (2.1)  ]  . In total, 81% of patients received all 6 cycles (of 28 days each) of GAZYVA-based therapy.

                Infusion≠B-NonOSE_AE   Reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE :  The incidence of  infusion≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  was 65% with the first infusion of GAZYVA. The incidence of Grade 3 or 4  infusion≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  was 20% with 7% of patients discontinuing therapy. The incidence of reactions with subsequent infusions was 3% with the second 1000 mg and < 1% thereafter. No Grade 3 or 4  infusion≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE  were reported beyond the first 1000 mg infused.
 

 Of the first 53 patients receiving GAZYVA on the trial, 47 (89%) experienced an  infusion≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reaction≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . After this experience, study protocol modifications were made to require pre-medication with a corticosteroid, antihistamine, and acetaminophen. The first dose was also divided into two infusions (100 mg on day 1 and 900 mg on day 2). For the 140 patients for whom these mitigation measures were implemented, 74 patients (53%) experienced a reaction with the first 1000 mg (64 patients on day 1, 3 patients on day 2, and 7 patients on both days) and < 3% thereafter  [see  Dosage and Administration (2)  ]  .



      Neutropenia≠B-NonOSE_AE   : The incidence of  neutropenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  reported as an adverse reaction was 38% in the GAZYVA treated arm and 32% in the rituximab treated arm, with the incidence of serious adverse events being 1% and < 1%, respectively (  Table 4  ). Cases of  late≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  onset≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   neutropenia≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (occurring 28 days after completion of treatment or later) were 16% in the GAZYVA treated arm and 12% in the rituximab treated arm.



      Infection≠B-NonOSE_AE :  The incidence of  infections≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was similar between GAZYVA and rituximab treated arms. Thirty-eight percent of patients in the GAZYVA treated arm and 37% in the rituximab treated arm experienced an  infection≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , with Grade 3-4 rates being 11% and 13%, respectively. Fatal events were reported in 1% of patients in both arms.



      Thrombocytopenia≠B-NonOSE_AE   : The overall incidence of  thrombocytopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  reported as an adverse reaction was higher in the GAZYVA treated arm (14%) compared to the rituximab treated arm (7%), with the incidence of Grade 3-4 events being 10% and 3%, respectively (  Table 4  ). The difference in incidences between the treatment arms is driven by events occurring during the first cycle. The incidence of  thrombocytopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (all grades) in the first cycle were 11% in the GAZYVA and 3% in the rituximab treated arms, with Grade 3-4 rates being 8% and 2%, respectively. Four percent of patients in the GAZYVA treated arm experienced acute  thrombocytopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (occurring within 24 hours after the GAZYVA infusion).



 The overall incidence of  hemorrhagic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   events≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and the number of fatal  hemorrhagic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   events≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  were similar between the treatment arms, with 3 in the rituximab and 4 in the GAZYVA treated arms. However, all fatal  hemorrhagic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   events≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  in patients treated with GAZYVA occurred in Cycle 1.



      Tumor≠B-NonOSE_AE   Lysis≠I-NonOSE_AE   Syndrome≠I-NonOSE_AE :  The incidence of Grade 3 or 4  tumor≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   lysis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   syndrome≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  was 2% in the GAZYVA treated arm versus 0% in the rituximab treated arm.



      Musculoskeletal≠B-NonOSE_AE   Disorders≠I-NonOSE_AE :  Adverse events related to  musculoskeletal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   disorders≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (all events from the System Organ Class), including  pain≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , have been reported in the GAZYVA treated arm with higher incidence than in the rituximab treated arm (18% vs. 15%).



      Liver≠B-NonOSE_AE   Enzyme≠I-NonOSE_AE   Elevations≠I-NonOSE_AE   :  Hepatic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   enzyme≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   elevations≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  have occurred in patients who received GAZYVA in clinical trials and had normal baseline hepatic enzyme levels (AST, ALT, and ALP). The events occurred most frequently within 24-48 hours of the first infusion. In some patients,  elevations≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  in  liver≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   enzymes≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  were observed concurrently with  infusion≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  or  tumor≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   lysis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   syndrome≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . In the pivotal study, there was no clinically meaningful difference in overall  hepatotoxicity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  adverse events between all arms (4% of patients in the GAZYVA treated arm). Medications commonly used to prevent  infusion≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE  (e.g., acetaminophen) may also be implicated in these events. Monitor liver function tests during treatment, especially during the first cycle. Consider treatment interruption or discontinuation for  hepatotoxicity≠B-NonOSE_AE .



   6.2 Immunogenicity

  Serum samples from patients with previously untreated  CLL≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  were tested during and after treatment for  antibodies≠B-NonOSE_AE   to≠I-NonOSE_AE   GAZYVA≠I-NonOSE_AE . Of the GAZYVA treated patients, 7% (18/271) tested  positive≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   for≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   anti≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  GAZYVA≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   antibodies≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  at one or more time points.  Neutralizing≠B-NonOSE_AE   activity≠I-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   anti≠I-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  GAZYVA≠I-NonOSE_AE   antibodies≠I-NonOSE_AE  has not been assessed.



 Immunogenicity data are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the test methods used. Additionally, the observed incidence of a positive result in a test method may be influenced by several factors, including sample handling, timing of sample collection, drug interference, concomitant medication, and the underlying disease. Therefore, comparison of the incidence of  antibodies≠B-NonOSE_AE   to≠I-NonOSE_AE   GAZYVA≠I-NonOSE_AE  with the incidence of  antibodies≠B-NonOSE_AE   to≠I-NonOSE_AE   other≠I-NonOSE_AE   products≠I-NonOSE_AE  may be misleading. Clinical significance of  anti≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  GAZYVA≠I-NonOSE_AE   antibodies≠I-NonOSE_AE  is not known.



   6.3 Additional Clinical Trial Experience
