  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

 During clinical development for the approved indications, 18560 patients were exposed to XARELTO. These included 7111 patients who received XARELTO 15 mg or 20 mg orally once daily for a mean of 19 months (5558 for 12 months and 2512 for 24 months) to reduce the risk of  stroke≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and  systemic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   embolism≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  in  nonvalvular≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   atrial≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   fibrillation≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  (ROCKET AF); 6962 patients who received XARELTO 15 mg orally twice daily for three weeks followed by 20 mg orally once daily to treat  DVT≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or  PE≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  (EINSTEIN  DVT≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , EINSTEIN  PE≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ), 10 mg or 20 mg orally once daily (EINSTEIN Extension, EINSTEIN CHOICE) to reduce the risk of recurrence of  DVT≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and/or  PE≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ; and 4487 patients who received XARELTO 10 mg orally once daily for prophylaxis of  DVT≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  following hip or knee replacement surgery (RECORD 1-3).

    Hemorrhage≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE 

 The most common adverse reactions with XARELTO were  bleeding≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   complications≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]  .

      Nonvalvular≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   Atrial≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   Fibrillation≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   

 In the ROCKET  AF≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  trial, the most frequent adverse reactions associated with permanent drug discontinuation were  bleeding≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  events, with incidence rates of 4.3% for XARELTO vs. 3.1% for warfarin. The incidence of discontinuations for  non≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  bleeding≠I-NonOSE_AE   adverse≠I-NonOSE_AE   events≠I-NonOSE_AE  was similar in both treatment groups.

 Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics and all of which were pre-specified ( diabetic≠B-NonOSE_AE  status was not pre-specified in the subgroup, but was a criterion for the CHADS2 score). The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted.

 In the pooled analysis of the EINSTEIN  DVT≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and EINSTEIN  PE≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  clinical studies, the most frequent adverse reactions leading to permanent drug discontinuation were  bleeding≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  events, with XARELTO vs. enoxaparin/Vitamin K antagonist (VKA) incidence rates of 1.7% vs. 1.5%, respectively. The mean duration of treatment was 208 days for XARELTO-treated patients and 204 days for enoxaparin/VKA-treated patients.

   EINSTEIN CHOICE Study

 In the EINSTEIN CHOICE clinical study, the most frequent adverse reactions associated with permanent drug discontinuation were  bleeding≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  events, with incidence rates of 1% for XARELTO 10 mg, 2% for XARELTO 20 mg, and 1% for acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) 100 mg. The mean duration of treatment was 293 days for XARELTO 10 mg-treated patients and 286 days for aspirin 100 mg-treated patients.

   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of XARELTO. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
