  6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under varying designs and in different patient populations, the adverse reaction rates reported in one clinical trial may not be easily compared to those rates reported in another clinical trial, and may not reflect the rates actually observed in clinical practice.



 The safety of ZALTRAP in combination with FOLFIRI was evaluated in 1216 previously treated patients with  metastatic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   colorectal≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  (Study 1) who were treated with ZALTRAP 4 mg per kg intravenous (N=611) or placebo (N=605) every two weeks (one cycle) in a randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study. Patients received a median of 9 cycles of ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI or 8 cycles of placebo/FOLFIRI.



 The most common adverse reactions (all grades, >=20% incidence) reported at a higher incidence (2% or greater between-arm difference) in the ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI arm , in order of decreasing frequency, were  leukopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  diarrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  neutropenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  proteinuria≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  AST≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   increased≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  stomatitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , fatigue,  thrombocytopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  ALT≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   increased≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  hypertension≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  weight≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   decreased≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  decreased≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   appetite≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  epistaxis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  abdominal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  dysphonia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  serum≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   creatinine≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   increased≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  headache≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (see  Table 1  ).



 The most common Grade 3-4 adverse reactions (>=5%) reported at a higher incidence (2% or greater between-arm difference) in the ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI arm, in order of decreasing frequency, were  neutropenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  diarrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  hypertension≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  leukopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  stomatitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  fatigue≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  proteinuria≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  asthenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (see  Table 1  ).



 The most frequent adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in >=1% of patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen were  asthenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE / fatigue≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  infections≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  diarrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  dehydration≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  hypertension≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  stomatitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  venous≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   thromboembolic≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   events≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  neutropenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  proteinuria≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .



 The ZALTRAP dose was reduced and/or omitted in 17% of patients compared to placebo-dose modification in 5% of patients. Cycle delays >7 days occurred in 60% of patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI compared with 43% of patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI.



 The most common adverse reactions and  laboratory≠B-NonOSE_AE   abnormalities≠I-NonOSE_AE  during study treatment in Study 1 where the incidence was >=5% (all grades) in patients receiving ZALTRAP in combination with FOLFIRI and which occurred at >=2% higher frequency in patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI compared to placebo/FOLFIRI are shown in Table 1.

            Infections≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred at a higher frequency in patients receiving ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI (46%, all grades; 12%, Grade 3-4) than in patients receiving placebo/FOLFIRI (33%, all grades; 7%, Grade 3-4), including  urinary≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   tract≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infection≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  nasopharyngitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  upper≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   respiratory≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   tract≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infection≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  pneumonia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  catheter≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   site≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infection≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  tooth≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   infection≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE .
 

 In patients with  mCRC≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , severe  hypersensitivity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI (0.3%) and placebo/FOLFIRI (0.5%).

Pulmonary≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   embolism≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred in 5% of patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI and 3.4% of patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI.



   6.2 Immunogenicity

  As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for  immunogenicity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . In patients with various  cancers≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  across 15 studies, 1.4% (41/2862) of patients tested  positive≠B-NonOSE_AE   for≠I-NonOSE_AE   anti≠I-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  product≠I-NonOSE_AE   antibody≠I-NonOSE_AE   (≠I-NonOSE_AE  APA≠I-NonOSE_AE ) at baseline. The incidence of  APA≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   development≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  was 3.1% (53/1687) in patients receiving intravenous ziv-aflibercept and 1.7% (19/1134) in patients receiving placebo. Among patients who tested  positive≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   for≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   APA≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and had sufficient samples for further testing,  neutralizing≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   antibodies≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   were≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   detected≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  in 17 of 48 ziv-aflibercept-treated patients and in 2 of 40 patients receiving placebo.



 The mean free ziv-aflibercept trough concentrations were lower in patients with  positive≠B-NonOSE_AE   neutralizing≠I-NonOSE_AE   antibodies≠I-NonOSE_AE  than in the overall population. The impact of  neutralizing≠B-NonOSE_AE   antibodies≠I-NonOSE_AE  on efficacy and safety could not be assessed based on limited available data.



  Immunogenicity≠B-NonOSE_AE  data are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of  antibody≠B-NonOSE_AE   positivity≠I-NonOSE_AE  in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of  antibodies≠B-NonOSE_AE   to≠I-NonOSE_AE   ZALTRAP≠I-NonOSE_AE  with the incidence of  antibodies≠B-NonOSE_AE  to other products may be misleading.
