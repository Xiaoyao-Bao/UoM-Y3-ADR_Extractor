   5.1  Hepatotoxicity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE 

   Drug≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  induced≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   hepatotoxicity≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  with  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE  outcome occurred in 2 (0.1%) of the 1719 patients treated with XALKORI across clinical trials. Concurrent  elevations≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   alanine≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   aminotransferase≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  ALT≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  )≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) greater than or equal to 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and  total≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   bilirubin≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   greater≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   than≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   or≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   equal≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   to≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   2≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   times≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   the≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   ULN≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , with normal alkaline phosphatase, occurred in 10 patients (<1%) treated with XALKORI.  Elevations≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  ALT or  AST≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  greater than 5 times the ULN occurred in 187 (11.2%) and 95 (5.7%) patients, respectively. Seventeen patients (1.0%) required permanent discontinuation due to  elevated≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   transaminases≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE .  Transaminase≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   elevations≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  generally occurred within the first 2 months of treatment.

 Monitor liver function tests, including ALT, AST, and total bilirubin, every 2 weeks during the first 2 months of treatment, then once a month, and as clinically indicated, with more frequent repeat testing for  increased≠B-NonOSE_AE   liver≠I-NonOSE_AE   transaminases≠I-NonOSE_AE , alkaline phosphatase, or total bilirubin in patients who develop  transaminase≠B-NonOSE_AE   elevations≠I-NonOSE_AE . Temporarily suspend, dose reduce, or permanently discontinue XALKORI as described in Table 2 [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  and  Adverse Reactions (6)  ]  .

    5.2 Interstitial Lung Disease (Pneumonitis)

  Severe, life-threatening, or fatal  interstitial≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   lung≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   disease≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  ILD≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE )/ pneumonitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  can occur in patients treated with XALKORI. Across clinical trials (n=1719), 50 XALKORI-treated patients (2.9%) had  ILD≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  of any grade, 18 patients (1.0%) had Grade 3 or 4  ILD≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and 8 patients (0.5%) had  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE   ILD≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .  Interstitial≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   lung≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   disease≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  generally occurred within 3 months after the initiation of XALKORI.

 Monitor patients for  pulmonary≠B-NonOSE_AE   symptoms≠I-NonOSE_AE  indicative of  ILD≠B-NonOSE_AE / pneumonitis≠B-NonOSE_AE . Exclude other potential causes of  ILD≠B-NonOSE_AE / pneumonitis≠B-NonOSE_AE , and permanently discontinue XALKORI in patients diagnosed with  drug≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  related≠I-NonOSE_AE   ILD≠I-NonOSE_AE / pneumonitis≠B-NonOSE_AE  [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  and  Adverse Reactions (6)  ]  .

    5.3 QT Interval Prolongation

   QTc≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   prolongation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  can occur in patients treated with XALKORI. Across clinical trials, 34 of 1616 patients (2.1%) had  QTcF≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (corrected QT for heart rate by the Fridericia method)  greater≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   than≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   or≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   equal≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   to≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   5≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  0≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  0≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   ms≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and 79 of 1582 patients (5.0%) had an  increase≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   from≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   baseline≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   QTcF≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  greater than or equal to 60 ms by automated machine-read evaluation of ECGs.

 Avoid use of XALKORI in patients with  congenital≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   long≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   QT≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   syndrome≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Monitor ECGs and electrolytes in patients with  congestive≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   heart≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   failure≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  bradyarrhythmias≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ,  electrolyte≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   abnormalities≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , or who are taking medications that are known to  prolong≠B-NonOSE_AE   the≠I-NonOSE_AE   QT≠I-NonOSE_AE   interval≠I-NonOSE_AE . Permanently discontinue XALKORI in patients who develop  QTc≠B-NonOSE_AE   greater≠I-NonOSE_AE   than≠I-NonOSE_AE   5≠I-NonOSE_AE  0≠I-NonOSE_AE  0≠I-NonOSE_AE   ms≠I-NonOSE_AE  or greater than or equal to 60 ms change from baseline with  Torsade≠B-NonOSE_AE   de≠I-NonOSE_AE   pointes≠I-NonOSE_AE  or  polymorphic≠B-NonOSE_AE   ventricular≠I-NonOSE_AE   tachycardia≠I-NonOSE_AE  or signs/symptoms of  serious≠B-NonOSE_AE   arrhythmia≠I-NonOSE_AE . Withhold XALKORI in patients who develop  QTc≠B-NonOSE_AE   greater≠I-NonOSE_AE   than≠I-NonOSE_AE   5≠I-NonOSE_AE  0≠I-NonOSE_AE  0≠I-NonOSE_AE   ms≠I-NonOSE_AE  on at least 2 separate ECGs until recovery to a QTc less than or equal to 480 ms, then resume XALKORI at a reduced dose as described in Table 2 [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)  ]  .

    5.4 Bradycardia

  Symptomatic  bradycardia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  can occur in patients receiving XALKORI. Across clinical trials,  bradycardia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred in 219 (12.7%) of 1719 patients treated with XALKORI. Grade 3  syncope≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred in 2.4% of XALKORI-treated patients and in 0.6% of the chemotherapy-treated patients.

 Avoid using XALKORI in combination with other agents known to cause  bradycardia≠B-NonOSE_AE  (e.g., beta-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, clonidine, and digoxin) to the extent possible. Monitor heart rate and blood pressure regularly. In cases of  symptomatic≠B-NonOSE_AE   bradycardia≠I-NonOSE_AE  that is not life-threatening, hold XALKORI until recovery to asymptomatic  bradycardia≠B-NonOSE_AE  or to a heart rate of 60 bpm or above, re-evaluate the use of concomitant medications, and adjust the dose of XALKORI. Permanently discontinue for life-threatening  bradycardia≠B-NonOSE_AE  due to XALKORI; however, if associated with concomitant medications known to cause  bradycardia≠B-NonOSE_AE  or  hypotension≠B-NonOSE_AE , hold XALKORI until recovery to asymptomatic  bradycardia≠B-NonOSE_AE  or to a heart rate of 60 bpm or above, and if concomitant medications can be adjusted or discontinued, restart XALKORI at 250 mg once daily with frequent monitoring [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  and  Adverse Reactions (6)  ]  .

    5.5 Severe Visual Loss

  Across all clinical trials, the incidence of Grade 4  visual≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   field≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   defect≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  with  vision≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   loss≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  was 0.2% (4/1719).  Optic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   atrophy≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  optic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   nerve≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   disorder≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported as potential causes of  vision≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   loss≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE .

 Discontinue XALKORI in patients with new onset of severe  visual≠B-NonOSE_AE   loss≠I-NonOSE_AE  (best corrected vision less than 20/200 in one or both eyes). Perform an ophthalmological evaluation consisting of best corrected visual acuity, retinal photographs, visual fields, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and other evaluations as appropriate for new onset of severe  visual≠B-NonOSE_AE   loss≠I-NonOSE_AE . There is insufficient information to characterize the risks of resumption of XALKORI in patients with a severe  visual≠B-NonOSE_AE   loss≠I-NonOSE_AE ; a decision to resume XALKORI should consider the potential benefits to the patient.

    5.6  Embryo≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  Fetal≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   Toxicity≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE 

  Based on its mechanism of action, XALKORI can cause  fetal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   harm≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  when administered to a  pregnant≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  woman. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of crizotinib in  pregnant≠B-NonOSE_AE  rats during organogenesis at exposures similar to those observed with the maximum recommended human dose resulted in  embryotoxicity≠B-NonOSE_AE  and  fetotoxicity≠B-NonOSE_AE . Advise  pregnant≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  women of the potential  risk≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   to≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   a≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   fetus≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with XALKORI and for at least 45 days following the final dose [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1  ,  8.3)  ]  . Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use condoms during treatment with XALKORI and for at least 90 days after the final dose [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.3)  and  Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)  ].
