   WARNINGS

  LIORESAL INTRATHECAL is for use in single bolus intrathecal injections (via a catheter placed in the lumbar intrathecal space or injection by lumbar puncture) and in implantable pumps approved by the FDA specifically for the intrathecal administration of baclofen. Because of the possibility of potentially life-threatening  CNS≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   depression≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  cardiovascular≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   collapse≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and/or  respiratory≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   failure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , physicians must be adequately trained and educated in chronic intrathecal infusion therapy.

 The pump system should not be implanted until the patient's response to bolus LIORESAL INTRATHECAL injection is adequately evaluated. Evaluation (consisting of a screening procedure: see  Dosage and Administration  ) requires that LIORESAL INTRATHECAL be administered into the intrathecal space via a catheter or lumbar puncture. Because of the risks associated with the screening procedure and the adjustment of dosage following pump implantation, these phases must be conducted in a medically supervised and adequately equipped environment following the instructions outlined in the Dosage and Administration section.

  Resuscitative equipment should be available.  

 Following surgical implantation of the pump, particularly during the initial phases of pump use, the patient should be monitored closely until it is certain that the patient's response to the infusion is acceptable and reasonably stable.

 On each occasion that the dosing rate of the pump and/or the concentration of LIORESAL INTRATHECAL (baclofen injection) in the reservoir is adjusted, close medical monitoring is required until it is certain that the patient's response to the infusion is acceptable and reasonably stable.

 It is mandatory that the patient, all patient caregivers, and the physicians responsible for the patient receive adequate information regarding the risks of this mode of treatment. All medical personnel and caregivers should be instructed in 1) the signs and symptoms of  overdose≠B-NonOSE_AE , 2) procedures to be followed in the event of  overdose≠B-NonOSE_AE  and 3) proper home care of the pump and insertion site.

    Overdose

  Signs of  overdose≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  may appear suddenly or insidiously. Acute massive  overdose≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  may present as  coma≠B-NonOSE_AE . Less sudden and/or less severe forms of  overdose≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  may present with signs of  drowsiness≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  lightheadedness≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  dizziness≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  somnolence≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  respiratory≠B-NonOSE_AE   depression≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  seizures≠B-NonOSE_AE , rostral progression of  hypotonia≠B-NonOSE_AE  and  loss≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   consciousness≠I-NonOSE_AE  progressing to  coma≠B-NonOSE_AE . Should  overdose≠B-NonOSE_AE  appear likely, the patient should be taken immediately to a hospital for assessment and emptying of the pump reservoir. In cases reported to date,  overdose≠B-NonOSE_AE  has generally been related to  pump≠B-NonOSE_AE   malfunction≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  inadvertent≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   subcutaneous≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   injection≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , or  dosing≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   error≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . (See   Drug≠B-NonOSE_AE   Overdose≠I-NonOSE_AE  Symptoms  and  Treatment.  )

 Extreme caution must be used when filling an FDA approved implantable pump. Such pumps should only be refilled through the reservoir refill septum.  Inadvertent≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   injection≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   into≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   the≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   subcutaneous≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   tissue≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  can occur if the reservoir refill septum is not properly accessed. Some pumps are also equipped with a catheter access port that allows direct access to the intrathecal catheter.  Direct≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   injection≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   into≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  this  catheter≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   access≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   port≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  or  inadvertent≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   injection≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   into≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   the≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   subcutaneous≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   tissue≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  may cause a life-threatening  overdose≠B-NonOSE_AE .

    Withdrawal

  Abrupt  withdrawal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  of intrathecal baclofen, regardless of the cause, has resulted in sequelae that included  high≠B-NonOSE_AE   fever≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  altered≠B-NonOSE_AE   mental≠I-NonOSE_AE   status≠I-NonOSE_AE , exaggerated  rebound≠B-NonOSE_AE   spasticity≠I-NonOSE_AE  and  muscle≠B-NonOSE_AE   rigidity≠I-NonOSE_AE  that in rare cases progressed to  rhabdomyolysis≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  multiple≠B-NonOSE_AE   organ≠I-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  system≠I-NonOSE_AE   failure≠I-NonOSE_AE , and  death≠B-NonOSE_AE . In the first 9 years of post-marketing experience, 27 cases of  withdrawal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  temporally related to the cessation of baclofen therapy were reported; six patients  died≠B-NonOSE_AE . In most cases, symptoms of  withdrawal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  appeared within hours to a few days following interruption of baclofen therapy. Common reasons for abrupt interruption of intrathecal baclofen therapy included  malfunction≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   the≠I-NonOSE_AE   catheter≠I-NonOSE_AE  (especially disconnection),  low≠B-NonOSE_AE   volume≠I-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   the≠I-NonOSE_AE   pump≠I-NonOSE_AE   reservoir≠I-NonOSE_AE , and  end≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   pump≠I-NonOSE_AE   battery≠I-NonOSE_AE   life≠I-NonOSE_AE ; human error may have played a causal or contributing role in some cases. Cases of  intrathecal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   mass≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   at≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   the≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   tip≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   the≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   implanted≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   catheter≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  leading to  withdrawal≠B-NonOSE_AE  symptoms have also been reported, most of them involving pharmacy compounded analgesic admixtures (see  PRECAUTIONS  ).

 Prevention of abrupt discontinuation of intrathecal baclofen requires careful attention to programming and monitoring of the infusion system, refill scheduling and procedures, and pump alarms. Patients and caregivers should be advised of the importance of keeping scheduled refill visits and should be educated on the early symptoms of  baclofen≠B-NonOSE_AE   withdrawal≠I-NonOSE_AE .

 All patients receiving intrathecal baclofen therapy are potentially at risk for  withdrawal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . Early symptoms of  baclofen≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   withdrawal≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  may include return of baseline  spasticity≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  pruritus≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  hypotension≠B-NonOSE_AE , and  paresthesias≠B-NonOSE_AE .  Priapism≠B-NonOSE_AE  may develop or recur if treatment with intrathecal baclofen is interrupted. Some clinical characteristics of the advanced  intrathecal≠B-NonOSE_AE   baclofen≠I-NonOSE_AE   withdrawal≠I-NonOSE_AE   syndrome≠I-NonOSE_AE  may resemble  autonomic≠B-NonOSE_AE   dysreflexia≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  infection≠B-NonOSE_AE  ( sepsis≠B-NonOSE_AE ),  malignant≠B-NonOSE_AE   hyperthermia≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  neuroleptic≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  malignant≠I-NonOSE_AE   syndrome≠I-NonOSE_AE , or other conditions associated with a  hypermetabolic≠B-NonOSE_AE   state≠I-NonOSE_AE  or widespread  rhabdomyolysis≠B-NonOSE_AE .

 Rapid, accurate diagnosis and treatment in an emergency-room or intensive-care setting are important in order to prevent the potentially life-threatening  central≠B-NonOSE_AE   nervous≠I-NonOSE_AE   system≠I-NonOSE_AE  and systemic  effects≠I-NonOSE_AE  of  intrathecal≠B-NonOSE_AE   baclofen≠I-NonOSE_AE   withdrawal≠I-NonOSE_AE . The suggested treatment for  intrathecal≠B-NonOSE_AE   baclofen≠I-NonOSE_AE   withdrawal≠I-NonOSE_AE  is the restoration of intrathecal baclofen at or near the same dosage as before therapy was interrupted. However, if restoration of intrathecal delivery is delayed, treatment with GABA-ergic agonist drugs such as oral or enteral baclofen, or oral, enteral, or intravenous benzodiazepines may prevent potentially  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE  sequelae. Oral or enteral baclofen alone should not be relied upon to halt the progression of  intrathecal≠B-NonOSE_AE   baclofen≠I-NonOSE_AE   withdrawal≠I-NonOSE_AE .

  Seizures≠B-NonOSE_AE  have been reported  during≠I-NonOSE_AE  overdose and w ith≠B-NonOSE_AE    wit≠I-NonOSE_AE hdrawal≠I-NonOSE_AE  from LIORESAL INTRATHECAL as well as in patients maintained on therapeutic doses of LIORESAL INTRATHECAL.

    Fatalities

   Spasticity of Spinal Cord Origin

  There were 16  deaths≠B-NonOSE_AE  reported among the 576 U.S. patients treated with LIORESAL INTRATHECAL (baclofen injection) in pre- and post- marketing studies evaluated as of December 1992. Because these patients were treated under uncontrolled clinical settings, it is impossible to determine definitively what role, if any, LIORESAL INTRATHECAL played in their  deaths≠B-NonOSE_AE .

 As a group, the patients who  died≠B-NonOSE_AE  were relatively young (mean age was 47 with a range from 25 to 63), but the majority suffered from severe  spasticity≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  of many years duration, were nonambulatory, had various medical complications such as  pneumonia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ,  urinary≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   tract≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   infections≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , and  decubiti≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , and/or had received multiple concomitant medications. A case-by-case review of the clinical course of the 16 patients who  died≠B-NonOSE_AE  failed to reveal any unique signs, symptoms, or laboratory results that would suggest that treatment with LIORESAL INTRATHECAL caused their  deaths≠B-NonOSE_AE . Two patients, however, did suffer  sudden≠B-NonOSE_AE   and≠I-NonOSE_AE   unexpected≠I-NonOSE_AE   death≠I-NonOSE_AE  within 2 weeks of pump implantation and one patient  died≠B-NonOSE_AE  unexpectedly after screening.

 One patient, a 44 year old male with  MS≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ,  died≠B-NonOSE_AE  in hospital on the second day following pump implantation. An autopsy demonstrated severe  fibrosis≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   the≠I-NonOSE_AE   coronary≠I-NonOSE_AE   conduction≠I-NonOSE_AE   system≠I-NonOSE_AE . A second patient, a 52 year old woman with  MS≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and a history of an  inferior≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   wall≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   myocardial≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   infarction≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , was found dead in bed 12 days after pump implantation, 2 hours after having had documented normal vital signs. An autopsy revealed  pulmonary≠B-NonOSE_AE   congestion≠I-NonOSE_AE  and  bilateral≠B-NonOSE_AE   pleural≠I-NonOSE_AE   effusions≠I-NonOSE_AE . It is impossible to determine whether LIORESAL INTRATHECAL contributed to these  deaths≠B-NonOSE_AE . The third patient underwent three baclofen screening trials. His medical history included  SCI≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ,  aspiration≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   pneumonia≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  septic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   shock≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  disseminated≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   intravascular≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   coagulopathy≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , severe  metabolic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   acidosis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  hepatic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   toxicity≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , and  status≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   epilepticus≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Twelve days after screening (he was not implanted), he again experienced  status≠B-NonOSE_AE   epilepticus≠I-NonOSE_AE  with subsequent significant  neurological≠B-NonOSE_AE   deterioration≠I-NonOSE_AE . Based upon prior instruction, extraordinary resuscitative measures were not pursued and the patient  died≠B-NonOSE_AE .

    Spasticity of Cerebral Origin

  There were three  deaths≠B-NonOSE_AE  occurring among the 211 patients treated with LIORESAL INTRATHECAL in pre- marketing studies as of March 1996. These  deaths≠B-NonOSE_AE  were not attributed to the therapy.
