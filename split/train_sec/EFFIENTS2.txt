    BOXED WARNING: WARNING: BLEEDING RISK 

  WARNING: BLEEDING RISK 

    *  Effient can cause significant, sometimes  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  bleeding≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 
 *  Do not use Effient in patients with active pathological  bleeding≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or a history of  transient≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   ischemic≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   attack≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  or  stroke≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  [see Contraindications (4.1, 4.2)]. 
 *  In patients >=75 years of age, Effient is generally not recommended, because of the increased risk of  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE  and  intracranial≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   bleeding≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and uncertain benefit, except in high-risk situations (patients with  diabetes≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or a history of prior  MI≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ) where its effect appears to be greater and its use may be considered [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. 
 *  Do not start Effient in patients likely to undergo urgent coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). When possible, discontinue Effient at least 7 days prior to any surgery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 
 *  Additional risk factors for  bleeding≠B-NonOSE_AE  include: body weight <60 kg;  propensity≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   to≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   bleed≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ; concomitant use of medications that increase the  risk≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   bleeding≠I-NonOSE_AE  (e.g., warfarin, heparin, fibrinolytic therapy, chronic use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 
 *  Suspect  bleeding≠B-NonOSE_AE  in any patient who is  hypotensive≠B-NonOSE_AE  and has recently undergone coronary angiography, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), CABG, or other surgical procedures in the setting of Effient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 
 *  If possible, manage  bleeding≠B-NonOSE_AE  without discontinuing Effient. Discontinuing Effient, particularly in the first few weeks after  acute≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   coronary≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   syndrome≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , increases the risk of subsequent  cardiovascular≠B-NonOSE_AE   events≠I-NonOSE_AE  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

 *  Effient can cause significant, sometimes fatal, bleeding (5.1, 5.2, 6.1). 
 *  Do not use Effient in patients with active pathological bleeding or a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke (4.1, 4.2). 
 *  In patients >=75 years of age, Effient is generally not recommended, except in high-risk patients (diabetes or prior MI), where its use may be considered (8.5). 
 *  Do not start Effient in patients likely to undergo urgent coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). When possible, discontinue Effient at least 7 days prior to any surgery (5.2). 
 *  Additional risk factors for bleeding include: body weight <60 kg; propensity to bleed; concomitant use of medications that increase the risk of bleeding (5.1). 
 *  Suspect bleeding in any patient who is hypotensive and has recently undergone coronary angiography, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), CABG, or other surgical procedures in the setting of Effient (5.1). 
 *  If possible, manage bleeding without discontinuing Effient. Stopping Effient increases the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events (5.3).
