  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 In two clinical trials, 791 subjects were treated with KERYDIN. The most commonly reported adverse reactions are listed below (  Table 1  ).

         A cumulative irritancy study revealed the potential for KERYDIN to cause  skin≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   irritation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . There was no evidence that KERYDIN causes contact sensitization.
