    WARNING: ESAs INCREASE THE RISK OF DEATH, MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, STROKE, VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM, THROMBOSIS OF VASCULAR ACCESS     AND    TUMOR PROGRESSION OR RECURRENCE  

     Chronic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   Kidney≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   Disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate :  

 *  In controlled trials, patients experienced greater risks for  death≠B-NonOSE_AE , serious  adverse≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   cardiovascular≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  stroke≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  when administered erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) to target a hemoglobin level of greater than 11 g/dL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 
 *  No trial has identified a hemoglobin target level, Aranesp dose, or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 
 *  Use the lowest Aranesp dose sufficient to reduce the need for red blood cell (RBC) transfusions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 
       Cancer≠B-Not_AE_Candidate :  
 

 *  ESAs shortened overall survival and/or increased the risk of  tumor≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   progression≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  or recurrence in clinical studies of patients with  breast≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , non-small cell lung, head and neck, lymphoid, and cervical  cancers≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 
 *  To decrease these risks, as well as the risk of serious  cardiovascular≠B-NonOSE_AE  and thromboembolic  reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE , use the lowest dose needed to avoid RBC transfusions [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. 
 *  Use ESAs only for  anemia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   from≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   myelosuppressive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   chemotherapy≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  [see Indications and Usage (1.2)].

 *  Discontinue following the completion of a chemotherapy course [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

   Chronic Kidney Disease    :  

 *  In controlled trials, patients experienced greater risks for death, serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, and stroke when administered erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) to target a hemoglobin level of greater than 11 g/dL (5.1). 
 *  No trial has identified a hemoglobin target level, Aranesp dose, or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks (2.2). 
 *  Use the lowest Aranesp dose sufficient to reduce the need for red blood cell (RBC) transfusions (5.1). 
      Cancer    :  
 

 *  ESAs shortened overall survival and/or increased the risk of tumor progression or recurrence in clinical studies of patients with breast, non-small cell lung, head and neck, lymphoid, and cervical cancers (5.2). 
 *  Use the lowest dose to avoid RBC transfusions (2.3). 
 *  Use ESAs only for anemia from myelosuppressive chemotherapy (1.2). 
 *  ESAs are not indicated for patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy when the anticipated outcome is cure (1.3). 
 *  Discontinue following the completion of a chemotherapy course (2.3).
