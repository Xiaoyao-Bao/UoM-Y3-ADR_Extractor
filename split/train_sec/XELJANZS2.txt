    WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS AND MALIGNANCY  

  EXCERPT:   WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS AND MALIGNANCY



   See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.  



 *  Serious infections leading to hospitalization or death, including tuberculosis and bacterial, invasive fungal, viral, and other opportunistic infections, have occurred in patients receiving XELJANZ. (5.1) 
 *  If a serious infection develops, interrupt XELJANZ until the infection is controlled. (5.1) 
 *  Prior to starting XELJANZ, perform a test for latent tuberculosis; if it is positive, start treatment for tuberculosis prior to starting XELJANZ. (5.1) 
 *  Monitor all patients for active tuberculosis during treatment, even if the initial latent tuberculosis test is negative. (5.1) 
 *  Lymphoma and other malignancies have been observed in patients treated with XELJANZ. Epstein Barr Virus-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder has been observed at an increased rate in renal transplant patients treated with XELJANZ and concomitant immunosuppressive medications. (5.2) 
    
 

    SERIOUS INFECTIONS  



   Patients treated with XELJANZ are at increased risk for developing serious  infections≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  that may lead to hospitalization or  death≠B-NonOSE_AE    [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)   and   Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Most patients who developed these  infections≠B-NonOSE_AE  were taking concomitant  immunosuppressants≠B-NonOSE_AE  such as methotrexate or corticosteroids.  



   If a serious  infection≠B-NonOSE_AE  develops, interrupt XELJANZ until the  infection≠B-NonOSE_AE  is controlled.   



   Reported  infections≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  include:   



 *   Active≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   tuberculosis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , which may present with  pulmonary≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  or extrapulmonary  disease≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . Patients should be tested for  latent≠B-NonOSE_AE   tuberculosis≠I-NonOSE_AE  before XELJANZ use and during therapy. Treatment for  latent≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   infection≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  should be initiated prior to XELJANZ use. 
 *   Invasive≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   fungal≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infections≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , including  cryptococcosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  pneumocystosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . Patients with  invasive≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   fungal≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infections≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease. 
 *   Bacterial≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , viral, and other  infections≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  due to  opportunistic≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  pathogens. 
      The risks and benefits of treatment with XELJANZ should be carefully considered prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent  infection≠B-Not_AE_Candidate .   
 

   Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of  infection≠B-NonOSE_AE  during and after treatment with XELJANZ, including the possible development of  tuberculosis≠B-NonOSE_AE  in patients who  tested≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   negative≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   for≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   latent≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   tuberculosis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   infection≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  prior to initiating therapy   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  .  



     MALIGNANCIES  



    Lymphoma≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and other  malignancies≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been observed in patients treated with XELJANZ.  Epstein≠B-NonOSE_AE   Barr≠I-NonOSE_AE   Virus≠I-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  associated≠I-NonOSE_AE   post≠I-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  transplant≠I-NonOSE_AE   lymphoproliferative≠I-NonOSE_AE   disorder≠I-NonOSE_AE  has been observed at an increased rate in  renal≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   transplant≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  patients treated with XELJANZ and concomitant immunosuppressive medications   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]  .
