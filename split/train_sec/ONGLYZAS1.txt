  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



     Adverse Reactions with Monotherapy and with Add-On Combination Therapy  

  In two placebo-controlled monotherapy trials of 24-weeks duration, patients were treated with ONGLYZA 2.5 mg daily, ONGLYZA 5 mg daily, and placebo. Three 24-week, placebo-controlled, add-on combination therapy trials were also conducted: one with metformin, one with a thiazolidinedione (pioglitazone or rosiglitazone), and one with glyburide. In these three trials, patients were randomized to add-on therapy with ONGLYZA 2.5 mg daily, ONGLYZA 5 mg daily, or placebo. A saxagliptin 10 mg treatment arm was included in one of the monotherapy trials and in the add-on combination trial with metformin. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage.



 In a prespecified pooled analysis of the 24-week data (regardless of glycemic rescue) from the two monotherapy trials, the add-on to metformin trial, the add-on to thiazolidinedione (TZD) trial, and the add-on to glyburide trial, the overall incidence of adverse events in patients treated with ONGLYZA 2.5 mg and ONGLYZA 5 mg was similar to placebo (72% and 72.2% versus 70.6%, respectively). Discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events occurred in 2.2%, 3.3%, and 1.8% of patients receiving ONGLYZA 2.5 mg, ONGLYZA 5 mg, and placebo, respectively. The most common adverse events (reported in at least 2 patients treated with ONGLYZA 2.5 mg or at least 2 patients treated with ONGLYZA 5 mg) associated with premature discontinuation of therapy included  lymphopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (0.1% and 0.5% versus 0%, respectively),  rash≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (0.2% and 0.3% versus 0.3%),  blood≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   creatinine≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   increased≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (0.3% and 0% versus 0%), and  blood≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   creatine≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   phosphokinase≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   increased≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (0.1% and 0.2% versus 0%). The adverse reactions in this pooled analysis reported (regardless of investigator assessment of causality) in >=5% of patients treated with ONGLYZA 5 mg, and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo are shown in Table 1.



 Table 1: Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled TrialsThe 5 placebo-controlled trials include two monotherapy trials and one add-on combination therapy trial with each of the following: metformin, thiazolidinedione, or glyburide. Table shows 24-week data regardless of glycemic rescue. Reported in >=5% of Patients Treated with ONGLYZA 5 mg and More Commonly than in Patients Treated with Placebo

         In patients treated with ONGLYZA 2.5 mg,  headache≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (6.5%) was the only adverse reaction reported at a rate >=5% and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo.
 

 In this pooled analysis, adverse reactions that were reported in >=2% of patients treated with ONGLYZA 2.5 mg or ONGLYZA 5 mg and >=1% more frequently compared to placebo included:  sinusitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (2.9% and 2.6% versus 1.6%, respectively),  abdominal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (2.4% and 1.7% versus 0.5%),  gastroenteritis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (1.9% and 2.3% versus 0.9%), and  vomiting≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (2.2% and 2.3% versus 1.3%).



 In the add-on to TZD trial, the incidence of  peripheral≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   edema≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  was higher for ONGLYZA 5 mg versus placebo (8.1% and 4.3%, respectively). The incidence of  peripheral≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   edema≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  for ONGLYZA 2.5 mg was 3.1%. None of the reported adverse reactions of  peripheral≠B-NonOSE_AE   edema≠I-NonOSE_AE  resulted in study drug discontinuation. Rates of  peripheral≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   edema≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  for ONGLYZA 2.5 mg and ONGLYZA 5 mg versus placebo were 3.6% and 2% versus 3% given as monotherapy, 2.1% and 2.1% versus 2.2% given as add-on therapy to metformin, and 2.4% and 1.2% versus 2.2% given as add-on therapy to glyburide.



 The incidence rate of  fractures≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was 1.0 and 0.6 per 100 patient-years, respectively, for ONGLYZA (pooled analysis of 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg) and placebo. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage. The incidence rate of  fracture≠B-NonOSE_AE  events in patients who received ONGLYZA did not increase over time. Causality has not been established and nonclinical studies have not demonstrated adverse effects of ONGLYZA on bone.



 An event of  thrombocytopenia≠B-NonOSE_AE , consistent with a diagnosis of  idiopathic≠B-NonOSE_AE   thrombocytopenic≠I-NonOSE_AE   purpura≠I-NonOSE_AE , was observed in the clinical program. The relationship of this event to ONGLYZA is not known.



     Adverse Reactions in Patients with Renal Impairment  

  ONGLYZA 2.5 mg was compared to placebo in a 12-week trial in 170 patients with  type≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   2≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   diabetes≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and moderate or  severe≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   renal≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   impairment≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  or  end≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  stage≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   renal≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  (ESRD). The incidence of adverse events, including serious adverse events and discontinuations due to adverse events, was similar between ONGLYZA and placebo.



     Adverse Reactions with Concomitant Use with Insulin  

  In the add-on to insulin trial [  see  Clinical Studies (14.2)    ], the incidence of adverse events, including serious adverse events and discontinuations due to adverse events, was similar between ONGLYZA and placebo, except for confirmed  hypoglycemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  [  see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ].



     Adverse Reactions with Concomitant Use with Metformin in Treatment-Naive Patients with Type 2 Diabetes  

  Table 2 shows the adverse reactions reported (regardless of investigator assessment of causality) in >=5% of patients participating in an additional 24-week, active-controlled trial of coadministered ONGLYZA and metformin in treatment-naive patients.

             Hypoglycemia  
   Adverse reactions of  hypoglycemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  were based on all reports of  hypoglycemia≠B-NonOSE_AE . A concurrent glucose measurement was not required or was normal in some patients. Therefore, it is not possible to conclusively determine that all these reports reflect true  hypoglycemia≠B-NonOSE_AE .



 In the add-on to glyburide study, the overall incidence of reported  hypoglycemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was higher for ONGLYZA 2.5 mg and ONGLYZA 5 mg (13.3% and 14.6%) versus placebo (10.1%). The incidence of confirmed  hypoglycemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  in this study, defined as symptoms of  hypoglycemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  accompanied by a fingerstick  glucose≠B-NonOSE_AE   value≠I-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   <≠I-NonOSE_AE  =≠I-NonOSE_AE  5≠I-NonOSE_AE  0≠I-NonOSE_AE   mg≠I-NonOSE_AE  /≠I-NonOSE_AE  dL≠I-NonOSE_AE , was 2.4% and 0.8% for ONGLYZA 2.5 mg and ONGLYZA 5 mg and 0.7% for placebo [  see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)    ]. The incidence of reported  hypoglycemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  for ONGLYZA 2.5 mg and ONGLYZA 5 mg versus placebo given as monotherapy was 4% and 5.6% versus 4.1%, respectively, 7.8% and 5.8% versus 5% given as add-on therapy to metformin, and 4.1% and 2.7% versus 3.8% given as add-on therapy to TZD. The incidence of reported  hypoglycemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  was 3.4% in treatment-naive patients given ONGLYZA 5 mg plus metformin and 4% in patients given metformin alone.



 In the active-controlled trial comparing add-on therapy with ONGLYZA 5 mg to glipizide in patients inadequately controlled on metformin alone, the incidence of reported  hypoglycemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  was 3% (19 events in 13 patients) with ONGLYZA 5 mg versus 36.3% (750 events in 156 patients) with glipizide. Confirmed symptomatic  hypoglycemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  (accompanying fingerstick  blood≠B-NonOSE_AE   glucose≠I-NonOSE_AE   <≠I-NonOSE_AE  =≠I-NonOSE_AE  5≠I-NonOSE_AE  0≠I-NonOSE_AE   mg≠I-NonOSE_AE  /≠I-NonOSE_AE  dL≠I-NonOSE_AE ) was reported in none of the ONGLYZA-treated patients and in 35 glipizide-treated patients (8.1%) (p<0.0001).



 During 12 weeks of treatment in patients with moderate or  severe≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   renal≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   impairment≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  or  ESRD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , the overall incidence of reported  hypoglycemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  was 20% among patients treated with ONGLYZA 2.5 mg and 22% among patients treated with placebo. Four ONGLYZA-treated patients (4.7%) and three placebo-treated patients (3.5%) reported at least one episode of confirmed symptomatic  hypoglycemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (accompanying fingerstick  glucose≠B-NonOSE_AE   <≠I-NonOSE_AE  =≠I-NonOSE_AE  5≠I-NonOSE_AE  0≠I-NonOSE_AE   mg≠I-NonOSE_AE  /≠I-NonOSE_AE  dL≠I-NonOSE_AE ).



 In the add-on to insulin trial, the overall incidence of reported  hypoglycemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  was 18.4% for ONGLYZA 5 mg and 19.9% for placebo. However, the incidence of confirmed symptomatic  hypoglycemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (accompanying fingerstick  blood≠B-NonOSE_AE   glucose≠I-NonOSE_AE   <≠I-NonOSE_AE  =≠I-NonOSE_AE  5≠I-NonOSE_AE  0≠I-NonOSE_AE   mg≠I-NonOSE_AE  /≠I-NonOSE_AE  dL≠I-NonOSE_AE ) was higher with ONGLYZA 5 mg (5.3%) versus placebo (3.3%).



 In the add-on to metformin plus sulfonylurea trial, the overall incidence of reported  hypoglycemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  was 10.1% for ONGLYZA 5 mg and 6.3% for placebo. Confirmed  hypoglycemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was reported in 1.6% of the ONGLYZA-treated patients and in none of the placebo-treated patients [  see      Warnings and Precautions (5.2)    ].



     Hypersensitivity Reactions  

   Hypersensitivity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  related≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   events≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , such as  urticaria≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  facial≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   edema≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  in the 5-study pooled analysis up to Week 24 were reported in 1.5%, 1.5%, and 0.4% of patients who received ONGLYZA 2.5 mg, ONGLYZA 5 mg, and placebo, respectively. None of these events in patients who received ONGLYZA required hospitalization or were reported as life-threatening by the investigators. One ONGLYZA-treated patient in this pooled analysis discontinued due to  generalized≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   urticaria≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  facial≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   edema≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE .



     Infections  

  In the unblinded, controlled, clinical trial database for ONGLYZA to date, there have been 6 (0.12%) reports of  tuberculosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  among the 4959 ONGLYZA-treated patients (1.1 per 1000 patient-years) compared to no reports of  tuberculosis≠B-NonOSE_AE  among the 2868 comparator-treated patients. Two of these six cases were confirmed with laboratory testing. The remaining cases had limited information or had presumptive diagnoses of  tuberculosis≠B-NonOSE_AE . None of the six cases occurred in the United States or in Western Europe. One case occurred in Canada in a patient originally from Indonesia who had recently visited Indonesia. The duration of treatment with ONGLYZA until report of  tuberculosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  ranged from 144 to 929 days. Post-treatment lymphocyte counts were consistently within the reference range for four cases. One patient had  lymphopenia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  prior to initiation of ONGLYZA that remained stable throughout ONGLYZA treatment. The final patient had an isolated  lymphocyte≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   count≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   below≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   normal≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  approximately four months prior to the report of  tuberculosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . There have been no spontaneous reports of  tuberculosis≠B-NonOSE_AE  associated with ONGLYZA use. Causality has not been estimated and there are too few cases to date to determine whether  tuberculosis≠B-NonOSE_AE  is related to ONGLYZA use.



 There has been one case of a potential  opportunistic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   infection≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  in the unblinded, controlled clinical trial database to date in an ONGLYZA-treated patient who developed suspected foodborne  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE   salmonella≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   sepsis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  after approximately 600 days of ONGLYZA therapy. There have been no spontaneous reports of  opportunistic≠B-NonOSE_AE   infections≠I-NonOSE_AE  associated with ONGLYZA use.



     Vital Signs  

  No clinically meaningful changes in vital signs have been observed in patients treated with ONGLYZA.



     Laboratory Tests  

    Absolute Lymphocyte Counts  

  There was a dose-related mean  decrease≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   absolute≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   lymphocyte≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   count≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  observed with ONGLYZA. From a baseline mean absolute  lymphocyte≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   count≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  of approximately 2200 cells/microL,  mean≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   decreases≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  of approximately 100 and 120 cells/microL with ONGLYZA 5 mg and 10 mg, respectively, relative to placebo were observed at 24 weeks in a pooled analysis of five placebo-controlled clinical studies. Similar effects were observed when ONGLYZA 5 mg was given in initial combination with metformin compared to metformin alone. There was no difference observed for ONGLYZA 2.5 mg relative to placebo. The proportion of patients who were reported to have a  lymphocyte≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   count≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   <≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  =≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  7≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  5≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  0≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   cells≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  /≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  microL≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  was 0.5%, 1.5%, 1.4%, and 0.4% in the ONGLYZA 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. In most patients, recurrence was not observed with repeated exposure to ONGLYZA although some patients had recurrent decreases upon rechallenge that led to discontinuation of ONGLYZA. The  decreases≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   lymphocyte≠I-NonOSE_AE   count≠I-NonOSE_AE  were not associated with clinically relevant adverse reactions. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage.



 The clinical significance of this  decrease≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   lymphocyte≠I-NonOSE_AE   count≠I-NonOSE_AE  relative to placebo is not known. When clinically indicated, such as in settings of unusual or prolonged  infection≠B-NonOSE_AE , lymphocyte count should be measured. The effect of ONGLYZA on lymphocyte counts in patients with  lymphocyte≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   abnormalities≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  (e.g.,  human≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   immunodeficiency≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   virus≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ) is unknown.



   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  Additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ONGLYZA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
