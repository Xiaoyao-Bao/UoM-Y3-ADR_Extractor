    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS



   EXCERPT:    *    CABG-related bleeding: Risk increases in patients receiving Effient who undergo CABG (  5.2  ). 
 *    Discontinuation of Effient: Premature discontinuation increases risk of stent thrombosis, MI, and death (  5.3  ). 
 *    Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP): TTP has been reported with Effient (  5.4  ). 
 *    Hypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity including angioedema has been reported with Effient including in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to other thienopyridines (  5.5  ). 
    
 

   5.1 General Risk of Bleeding



  Thienopyridines, including Effient, increase the risk of  bleeding≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . With the dosing regimens used in TRITON-TIMI 38, TIMI (Thrombolysis in  Myocardial≠B-NonOSE_AE   Infarction≠I-NonOSE_AE ) Major (clinically overt  bleeding≠B-NonOSE_AE  associated with a  fall≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   hemoglobin≠I-NonOSE_AE  >=5 g/dL, or  intracranial≠B-NonOSE_AE   hemorrhage≠I-NonOSE_AE ) and TIMI Minor (overt  bleeding≠B-NonOSE_AE  associated with a  fall≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   hemoglobin≠I-NonOSE_AE  of >=3 g/dL but <5 g/dL)  bleeding≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  events were more common on Effient than on clopidogrel [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . The  bleeding≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  risk is highest initially, as shown in  Figure 1  (events through 450 days; inset shows events through 7 days).

 Suspect  bleeding≠B-NonOSE_AE  in any patient who is  hypotensive≠B-NonOSE_AE  and has recently undergone coronary angiography, PCI, CABG, or other surgical procedures even if the patient does not have overt signs of  bleeding≠B-NonOSE_AE .



 Do not use Effient in patients with  active≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   bleeding≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , prior  TIA≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or  stroke≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  [see Contraindications (  4.1  ,  4.2  )]  .



 Other risk factors for  bleeding≠B-NonOSE_AE  are:



 *    Age >=75 years. Because of the risk of  bleeding≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (including  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE   bleeding≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ) and uncertain effectiveness in patients >=75 years of age, use of Effient is generally not recommended in these patients, except in high-risk situations (patients with  diabetes≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or  history≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   of≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   myocardial≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   infarction≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ) where its effect appears to be greater and its use may be considered [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  ), Use in Specific Populations (  8.5  ), Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  ), and Clinical Trials (  14  )] . 
 *    CABG or other surgical procedure [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )] . 
 *    Body weight <60 kg. Consider a lower (5-mg) maintenance dose [see Dosage and Administration (  2  ), Adverse Reactions (  6.1  ), and Use in Specific Populations (  8.6  )] . 
 *     Propensity≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   to≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   bleed≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  (e.g., recent trauma, recent surgery, recent or recurrent  gastrointestinal≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   (≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  GI≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  )≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   bleeding≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , active  peptic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   ulcer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , severe  hepatic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   impairment≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , or moderate to severe  renal≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   impairment≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ) [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  ) and Use in Specific Populations (  8.7  ,  8.8  )] . 
 *    Medications that increase the risk of  bleeding≠B-NonOSE_AE  (e.g., oral anticoagulants, chronic use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], and fibrinolytic agents). Aspirin and heparin were commonly used in TRITON-TIMI 38 [see Drug Interactions (  7.1  ,  7.2  .  7.3  ), and Clinical Studies (  14  )] . 
    Thienopyridines inhibit platelet aggregation for the lifetime of the platelet (7-10 days), so withholding a dose will not be useful in managing a  bleeding≠B-NonOSE_AE  event or the risk of  bleeding≠B-NonOSE_AE  associated with an invasive procedure. Because the half-life of prasugrel's active metabolite is short relative to the lifetime of the platelet, it may be possible to restore hemostasis by administering exogenous platelets; however, platelet transfusions within 6 hours of the loading dose or 4 hours of the maintenance dose may be less effective.

  The risk of  bleeding≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  is increased in patients receiving Effient who undergo CABG. If possible, Effient should be discontinued at least 7 days prior to CABG.



 Of the 437 patients who underwent CABG during TRITON-TIMI 38, the rates of CABG-related TIMI Major or Minor  bleeding≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  were 14.1% in the Effient group and 4.5% in the clopidogrel group [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . The higher risk for  bleeding≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  events in patients treated with Effient persisted up to 7 days from the most recent dose of study drug. For patients receiving a thienopyridine within 3 days prior to CABG, the frequencies of TIMI Major or Minor  bleeding≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  were 26.7% (12 of 45 patients) in the Effient group, compared with 5.0% (3 of 60 patients) in the clopidogrel group. For patients who received their last dose of thienopyridine within 4 to 7 days prior to CABG, the frequencies decreased to 11.3% (9 of 80 patients) in the prasugrel group and 3.4% (3 of 89 patients) in the clopidogrel group.



 Do not start Effient in patients likely to undergo urgent CABG.  CABG≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  related≠I-NonOSE_AE   bleeding≠I-NonOSE_AE  may be treated with transfusion of blood products, including packed red blood cells and platelets; however, platelet transfusions within 6 hours of the loading dose or 4 hours of the maintenance dose may be less effective.



    5.3 Discontinuation of Effient



  Discontinue thienopyridines, including Effient, for  active≠B-NonOSE_AE   bleeding≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  elective≠B-NonOSE_AE   surgery≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  stroke≠B-NonOSE_AE , or  TIA≠B-NonOSE_AE . The optimal duration of thienopyridine therapy is unknown. In patients who are managed with PCI and stent placement, premature discontinuation of any antiplatelet medication, including thienopyridines, conveys an increased risk of  stent≠B-NonOSE_AE   thrombosis≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  myocardial≠B-NonOSE_AE   infarction≠I-NonOSE_AE , and  death≠B-NonOSE_AE . Patients who require premature discontinuation of a thienopyridine will be at increased risk for  cardiac≠B-NonOSE_AE   events≠I-NonOSE_AE . Lapses in therapy should be avoided, and if thienopyridines must be temporarily discontinued because of an adverse event(s), they should be restarted as soon as possible [see Contraindications (  4.1  ,  4.2  ) and Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )]  .



    5.4 Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura



   Thrombotic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   thrombocytopenic≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   purpura≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  TTP≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ) has been reported with the use of Effient.  TTP≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  can occur after a brief exposure (<2 weeks).  TTP≠B-NonOSE_AE  is a serious condition that can be  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE  and requires urgent treatment, including plasmapheresis (plasma exchange).  TTP≠B-NonOSE_AE  is characterized by  thrombocytopenia≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  microangiopathic≠B-NonOSE_AE   hemolytic≠I-NonOSE_AE   anemia≠I-NonOSE_AE  ( schistocytes≠B-NonOSE_AE  [ fragment≠B-NonOSE_AE   red≠I-NonOSE_AE   blood≠I-NonOSE_AE   cells≠I-NonOSE_AE ] seen on peripheral smear),  neurological≠B-NonOSE_AE   findings≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  renal≠B-NonOSE_AE   dysfunction≠I-NonOSE_AE , and  fever≠B-NonOSE_AE  [see Adverse Reactions (  6.2  )]  .



    5.5 Hypersensitivity Including Angioedema



   Hypersensitivity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  including  angioedema≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  has been reported in patients receiving Effient, including patients with a history of  hypersensitivity≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   reaction≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  to other thienopyridines [see Contraindications (  4.3  ) and Adverse Reactions (  6.2  )]  .
