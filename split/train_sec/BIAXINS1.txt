  ADVERSE REACTIONS

  The majority of side effects observed in clinical trials were of a mild and transient nature. Fewer than 3% of adult patients without  mycobacterial≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   infections≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and fewer than 2% of pediatric patients without  mycobacterial≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   infections≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  discontinued therapy because of drug-related side effects. Fewer than 2% of adult patients taking BIAXIN XL tablets discontinued therapy because of drug-related side effects.

 The most frequently reported events in adults taking BIAXIN tablets (clarithromycin tablets, USP) were  diarrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (3%),  nausea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (3%),  abnormal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   taste≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (3%),  dyspepsia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (2%),  abdominal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE /discomfort (2%), and  headache≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (2%). In pediatric patients, the most frequently reported events were  diarrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (6%),  vomiting≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (6%),  abdominal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (3%),  rash≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (3%), and  headache≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (2%). Most of these events were described as mild or moderate in severity. Of the reported adverse events, only 1% was described as severe.

 The most frequently reported events in adults taking BIAXIN XL (Clarithromycin extended-release tablets) were  diarrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (6%),  abnormal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   taste≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (7%), and  nausea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (3%). Most of these events were described as mild or moderate in severity. Of the reported adverse events, less than 1% were described as severe.

 In the  acute≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   exacerbation≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   of≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   chronic≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   bronchitis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and  acute≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   maxillary≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   sinusitis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  studies overall  gastrointestinal≠B-NonOSE_AE   adverse≠I-NonOSE_AE   events≠I-NonOSE_AE  were reported by a similar proportion of patients taking either BIAXIN tablets or BIAXIN XL tablets; however, patients taking BIAXIN XL tablets reported significantly less severe  gastrointestinal≠B-NonOSE_AE   symptoms≠I-NonOSE_AE  compared to patients taking BIAXIN tablets. In addition, patients taking BIAXIN XL tablets had significantly fewer premature discontinuations for drug-related  gastrointestinal≠B-NonOSE_AE  or abnormal taste  adverse≠I-No nOSE≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  _≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  AE≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE     even≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ts≠I-NonOSE_AE  compared to BIAXIN tablets.

 In  community≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  acquired≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   pneumonia≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  studies conducted in adults comparing clarithromycin to erythromycin base or erythromycin stearate, there were fewer adverse events involving the digestive system in clarithromycin-treated patients compared to erythromycin-treated patients (13% vs 32%; p < 0.01). Twenty percent of erythromycin-treated patients discontinued therapy due to adverse events compared to 4% of clarithromycin-treated patients.

 In two U.S. studies of  acute≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   otitis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   media≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  comparing clarithromycin to amoxicillin/potassium clavulanate in pediatric patients, there were fewer adverse events involving the digestive system in clarithromycin-treated patients compared to amoxicillin/potassium clavulanate-treated patients (21% vs. 40%, p < 0.001). One-third as many clarithromycin-treated patients reported  diarrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  as did amoxicillin/potassium clavulanate-treated patients.

 There have been post-marketing reports of  colchicine≠B-NonOSE_AE   toxicity≠I-NonOSE_AE  with concomitant use of clarithromycin and colchicine, especially in the elderly, some of which occurred in patients with  renal≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   insufficiency≠I-Not_AE_Candidate .  Deaths≠B-NonOSE_AE  have been reported in some such patients. (See  WARNINGS  and  PRECAUTIONS  .)

 There have been reports of  rhabdomyolysis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  coincident with clarithromycin use. In some reports, clarithromycin was administered concomitantly with statins, fibrates, colchicine or allopurinol.
