 *  Effectiveness of Plavix depends on conversion to an active metabolite by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system, principally CYP2C19. (5.1, 12.3) 
 *  Tests are available to identify patients who are CYP2C19 poor metabolizers. (12.5) 
 *  Consider use of another platelet P2Y12 inhibitor in patients identified as CYP2C19 poor metabolizers. (5.1) 
    
 

    The effectiveness of Plavix results from its antiplatelet activity, which is dependent on its conversion to an active metabolite by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system, principally CYP2C19   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ,   Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  .
