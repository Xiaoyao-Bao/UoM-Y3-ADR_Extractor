   Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk

  Patients with  major≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depressive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   (≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  MDD≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ), both adult and pediatric, may experience  worsening≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   their≠I-NonOSE_AE   depression≠I-NonOSE_AE  and/or the emergence of  suicidal≠B-NonOSE_AE  ideation and  behavior≠I-NonOSE_AE  ( suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE ) or  unusual≠B-NonOSE_AE   changes≠I-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   behavior≠I-NonOSE_AE , whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs.  Suicide≠B-NonOSE_AE   is≠I-NonOSE_AE  a known risk of  depression≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and certain other  psychiatric≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorders≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of  suicide≠B-NonOSE_AE . There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing  worsening≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   depression≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and the emergence of  suicidality≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of  suicidal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  thinking and  behavior≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  ( suicidality≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18-24) with  major≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depressive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   (≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  MDD≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ) and other  psychiatric≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorders≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE  with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.

 The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with  MDD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ,  obsessive≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   compulsive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   (≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  OCD≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ), or other  psychiatric≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorders≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with  MDD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or other  psychiatric≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorders≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of  suicidality≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  among drugs, but a tendency toward an  increase≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE  across different indications, with the highest incidence in  MDD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate . The risk differences (drug vs. placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE  per 1000 patients treated) are provided in Table 1.

 >=65                       6 fewer cases                                                                 
        No  suicides≠B-NonOSE_AE  occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were  suicides≠B-NonOSE_AE  in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on  suicide≠B-NonOSE_AE .
 

 It is unknown whether the  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE  risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with  depression≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of  depression≠B-NonOSE_AE .

  All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening,  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE , and  unusual≠B-NonOSE_AE   changes≠I-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   behavior≠I-NonOSE_AE , especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases.  

 The following symptoms,  anxiety≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  agitation≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  panic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   attacks≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  insomnia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  irritability≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  hostility≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  aggressiveness≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  impulsivity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  akathisia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  ( psychomotor≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   restlessness≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ),  hypomania≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  mania≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for  major≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depressive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  as well as for other indications, both  psychiatric≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the  worsening≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   depression≠I-NonOSE_AE  and/or the emergence of  suicidal≠B-NonOSE_AE   impulses≠I-NonOSE_AE  has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE .

 Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose  depression≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE  or symptoms that might be precursors to  worsening≠B-NonOSE_AE   depression≠I-NonOSE_AE  or  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE , especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.

  Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for  major≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depressive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of  agitation≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  irritability≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  unusual≠B-NonOSE_AE   changes≠I-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   behavior≠I-NonOSE_AE , and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE , and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers.  Prescriptions for REMERON (mirtazapine) Tablets should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of  overdose≠B-NonOSE_AE .

    Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder

  A  major≠B-NonOSE_AE   depressive≠I-NonOSE_AE   episode≠I-NonOSE_AE  may be the initial presentation of  bipolar≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of  precipitation≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   a≠I-NonOSE_AE   mixed≠I-NonOSE_AE  /≠I-NonOSE_AE  manic≠I-NonOSE_AE   episode≠I-NonOSE_AE  in patients at risk for  bipolar≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with  depressive≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   symptoms≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for  bipolar≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ; such screening should include a detailed  psychiatric≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  history, including a  family≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   history≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   of≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   suicide≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  bipolar≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , and  depression≠B-Not_AE_Candidate . It should be noted that REMERON (mirtazapine) Tablets are not approved for use in treating  bipolar≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depression≠I-Not_AE_Candidate .

    Agranulocytosis

   In premarketing clinical trials, 2 (1 with  Sjogren≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  s≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   Syndrome≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ) out of 2796 patients treated with REMERON (mirtazapine) Tablets developed  agranulocytosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  [ absolute≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   neutrophil≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   count≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  ANC≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  )≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   <≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  5≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  0≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  0≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  /≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  mm≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE    3≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   with associated signs and symptoms, e.g.,  fever≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  infection≠B-NonOSE_AE , etc.] and a third patient developed severe  neutropenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  ( ANC≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   <≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  5≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  0≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  0≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  /≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  mm≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE    3≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   without any associated symptoms). For these 3 patients, onset of severe  neutropenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was detected on days 61, 9, and 14 of treatment, respectively. All 3 patients recovered after REMERON was stopped. These 3 cases yield a crude incidence of severe  neutropenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (with or without associated infection) of approximately 1.1 per thousand patients exposed, with a very wide 95% confidence interval, i.e., 2.2 cases per 10,000 to 3.1 cases per 1000. If a patient develops a  sore≠B-NonOSE_AE   throat≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  fever≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  stomatitis≠B-NonOSE_AE , or other signs of  infection≠B-NonOSE_AE , along with a  low≠B-NonOSE_AE   WBC≠I-NonOSE_AE   count≠I-NonOSE_AE , treatment with REMERON should be discontinued and the patient should be closely monitored.  

    Serotonin Syndrome

  The development of a potentially life-threatening  serotonin≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   syndrome≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  has been reported with SNRIs and SSRIs, including REMERON, alone but particularly with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John's wort), and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue).

  Serotonin≠B-NonOSE_AE   syndrome≠I-NonOSE_AE  symptoms may include  mental≠B-NonOSE_AE   status≠I-NonOSE_AE   changes≠I-NonOSE_AE  (e.g.,  agitation≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  hallucinations≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  delirium≠B-NonOSE_AE , and  coma≠B-NonOSE_AE ),  autonomic≠B-NonOSE_AE   instability≠I-NonOSE_AE  (e.g.,  tachycardia≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  labile≠B-NonOSE_AE   blood≠I-NonOSE_AE   pressure≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  dizziness≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  diaphoresis≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  flushing≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  hyperthermia≠B-NonOSE_AE ),  neuromuscular≠B-NonOSE_AE   symptoms≠I-NonOSE_AE  (e.g.,  tremor≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  rigidity≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  myoclonus≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  hyperreflexia≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  incoordination≠B-NonOSE_AE ),  seizures≠B-NonOSE_AE , and/or  gastrointestinal≠B-NonOSE_AE   symptoms≠I-NonOSE_AE  (e.g.,  nausea≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  vomiting≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  diarrhea≠B-NonOSE_AE ). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of  serotonin≠B-NonOSE_AE   syndrome≠I-NonOSE_AE .

 The concomitant use of REMERON with MAOIs intended to treat  psychiatric≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorders≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  is contraindicated. REMERON should also not be started in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. All reports with methylene blue that provided information on the route of administration involved intravenous administration in the dose range of 1 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection) or at lower doses. There may be circumstances when it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking REMERON. REMERON should be discontinued before initiating treatment with the MAOI (see  CONTRAINDICATIONS  and  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  ).

 If concomitant use of REMERON with other serotonergic drugs, including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, buspirone, tryptophan, and St. John's wort, is clinically warranted, be aware of a potential increased risk for  serotonin≠B-NonOSE_AE   syndrome≠I-NonOSE_AE , particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases.

 Treatment with REMERON and any concomitant serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately if the above events occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated.

    Angle-Closure Glaucoma

  The  pupillary≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   dilation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including REMERON may trigger an  angle≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  closure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   attack≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  in a patient with  anatomically≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   narrow≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   angles≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  who does not have a patent iridectomy.

    QT Prolongation and Torsades de Pointes

  The  effect≠B-NonOSE_AE  of REMER ON≠I-NonOSE_AE  (mirtazapine) on  QTc≠I-NonOSE_AE   interval≠I-NonOSE_AE  was assessed in a clinical randomized trial with placebo and positive (moxifloxacin) controls involving 54 healthy volunteers using exposure response analysis. This trial showed a positive relationship between mirtazapine concentrations and  prolongation≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   the≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   QTc≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   interval≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . However, the degree of  QT≠B-NonOSE_AE   prolongation≠I-NonOSE_AE  observed with both 45 mg (therapeutic) and 75 mg (supratherapeutic) doses of mirtazapine was not at a level generally considered to be clinically meaningful. During the postmarketing use of mirtazapine, cases of  QT≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   prolongation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  Torsades≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   de≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   Pointes≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  ventricular≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   tachycardia≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  sudden≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   death≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , have been reported (see  ADVERSE REACTIONS  ). The majority of reports occurred in association with  overdose≠B-NonOSE_AE  or in patients with other risk factors for  QT≠B-NonOSE_AE   prolongation≠I-NonOSE_AE , including concomitant use of  QTc≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  prolonging≠I-NonOSE_AE  medicines (see  PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions  and  OVERDOSE  sections). Caution should be exercised when REMERON is prescribed in patients with known  cardiovascular≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  or family history of  QT≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   prolongation≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , and in concomitant use with other medicinal products thought to  prolong≠B-NonOSE_AE   the≠I-NonOSE_AE   QTc≠I-NonOSE_AE   interval≠I-NonOSE_AE .
