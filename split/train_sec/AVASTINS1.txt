  6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

  Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

 The most common adverse reactions observed in patients receiving Avastin as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy at a rate > 10%, are  epistaxis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  headache≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  hypertension≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  rhinitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  proteinuria≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  taste≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   alteration≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  dry≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   skin≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  rectal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   hemorrhage≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  lacrimation≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   disorder≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  back≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  exfoliative≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   dermatitis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE .

 The safety data below reflect exposure to Avastin in 2919 patients with  mCRC≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , non-squamous  NSCLC≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ,  glioblastoma≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ,  mRCC≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ,  cervical≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , platinum-resistant or platinum-sensitive  recurrent≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   epithelial≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   ovarian≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal  cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , including controlled studies (AVF2107g, E3200, E4599, EORTC 26101, BO17705, GOG-0240, MO22224, AVF4095, GOG-0213) at the recommended dose and schedule for a median of 6 to 23 doses.

 Across clinical studies, Avastin was discontinued in 8% to 22% of patients because of adverse reactions  [see  Clinical Studies (14)  ].  

     Platinum  -  Resistant Recurrent Epithelia Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer  

 The safety of Avastin was evaluated in 179 patients who received at least one dose of Avastin in a multicenter, open-label study (MO22224) in which patients were randomized (1:1) to Avastin with chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone in patients with platinum resistant,  recurrent≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   epithelial≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   ovarian≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal  cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  that recurred within < 6 months from the most recent platinum based therapy. Patients were randomized to receive Avastin (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks). Patients had received no more than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens. The trial excluded patients with evidence of  recto≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  sigmoid≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   involvement≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  by pelvic examination or  bowel≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   involvement≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  on CT scan or clinical symptoms of  bowel≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   obstruction≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Patients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Forty percent of patients on the chemotherapy alone arm received Avastin alone upon progression. The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population. Adverse reactions are presented in  Table 2  .

     Platinum-Sensitive Recurrent Epithelial Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer  

 The safety of Avastin was evaluated in 247 patients who received at least one dose of Avastin in a double-blind study (AVF4095g) in patients with platinum sensitive  recurrent≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   epithelial≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   ovarian≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , fallopian tube or primary peritoneal  cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive Avastin (15 mg/kg) or placebo every 3 weeks with carboplatin and gemcitabine for 6 to 10 cycles followed by Avastin or placebo alone until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population. Adverse reactions are presented in  Table 3  .

         Grade 3-4 adverse reactions occurring at a higher incidence (>= 2%) in patients receiving Avastin with chemotherapy compared to placebo with chemotherapy were:  thrombocytopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (40% vs. 34%),  nausea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (4% vs. 1.3%),  fatigue≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (6% vs. 4%),  headache≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (4% vs. 0.9%),  proteinuria≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (10% vs. 0.4%),  dyspnea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (4% vs. 1.7%),  epistaxis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (5% vs. 0.4%), and  hypertension≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (17% vs. 0.9%).
 

 The safety of Avastin was evaluated in an open-label, controlled study, GOG-0213, in 325 patients with platinum-sensitive  recurrent≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   epithelial≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   ovarian≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal  cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , who have not received more than one previous regimen of chemotherapy. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive carboplatin and paclitaxel for 6 to 8 cycles or Avastin (15 mg/kg every 3 weeks) with carboplatin and paclitaxel for 6 to 8 cycles followed by Avastin as a single agent until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population. Adverse reactions are presented in  Table 4  .

     Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (mRCC)  

 The safety of Avastin was evaluated in 337 patients who received at least one dose of Avastin in a multicenter, double-blind study (BO17705) in patients with  metastatic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   renal≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   cell≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   carcinoma≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Patients who had undergone a nephrectomy were randomized (1:1) to receive either Avastin (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks) or placebo with interferon alfa. Patients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population.

     Persistent, Recurrent, or Metastatic Cervical Cancer  

 The safety of Avastin was evaluated in 218 patients who received at least one dose of Avastin in a multicenter study (GOG-0240) in patients with persistent,  recurrent≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , or metastatic  cervical≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Patients were randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive paclitaxel and cisplatin with or without Avastin (15 mg/kg every 3 weeks), or paclitaxel and topotecan with or without Avastin (15 mg/kg every 3 weeks). The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population. Adverse reactions are presented in  Table 6  .

     Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (mCRC)  

 The safety of Avastin was evaluated in 392 patients who received at least one dose of Avastin in a double-blind, active-controlled study (AVF2107g), which compared Avastin (5 mg/kg every 2 weeks) with bolus-IFL to placebo with bolus IFL in patients with mCRC. Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to placebo with bolus IFL, Avastin with bolus IFL, or Avastin with 5 fluorouracil and leucovorin. The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population.

 All Grade 3-4 adverse reactions and selected Grade 1-2 adverse reactions (i.e.,  hypertension≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  proteinuria≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  thromboembolic≠B-NonOSE_AE   events≠I-NonOSE_AE ) were collected in the entire study population. Adverse reactions are presented in  Table 7  .

         The safety of Avastin was evaluated in 521 patients in an open-label, active-controlled study (E3200). Patients who were previously treated with irinotecan and fluorouracil for initial therapy for  metastatic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   colorectal≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to FOLFOX4, Avastin (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks prior to FOLFOX4 on Day 1) with FOLFOX4, or Avastin alone (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks). Avastin was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
 

 The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population. The most frequent adverse reactions (selected Grade 3-5 non-hematologic and Grade 4-5 hematologic) occurring at a higher incidence (>= 2%) in patients receiving Avastin with FOLFOX4 compared to FOLFOX4 alone were  fatigue≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (19% vs. 13%),  diarrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (18% vs. 13%),  sensory≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   neuropathy≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (17% vs. 9%),  nausea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (12% vs. 5%),  vomiting≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (11% vs. 4%),  dehydration≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (10% vs. 5%),  hypertension≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (9% vs. 2%),  abdominal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (8% vs. 5%),  hemorrhage≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (5% vs. 1%),  other≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   neurological≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (5% vs. 3%),  ileus≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (4% vs. 1%) and  headache≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (3% vs. 0%). These data are likely to under-estimate the true adverse event rates due to the reporting mechanisms.

     First-Line Non Squamous Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)  

 The safety of Avastin was evaluated as first-line treatment in 422 patients with unresectable  NSCLC≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  who received at least one dose of Avastin in an active-controlled, open-label, multicenter trial (E4599). Chemotherapy naive patients with locally advanced, metastatic or recurrent non-squamous  NSCLC≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  were randomized (1:1) to receive six 21 day cycles of paclitaxel and carboplatin with or without Avastin (15 mg/kg every 3 weeks). After completion or upon discontinuation of chemotherapy, patients randomized to receive Avastin continued to receive Avastin alone until disease progression or until unacceptable toxicity. The trial excluded patients with predominant squamous histology (mixed cell type tumors only),  CNS≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   metastasis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  gross≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   hemoptysis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  (1/2 teaspoon or more of red blood),  unstable≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   angina≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , or receiving therapeutic anticoagulation. The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population.

 Only Grade 3-5 non hematologic and Grade 4-5  hematologic≠B-NonOSE_AE   adverse≠I-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE  were collected. Grade 3-5  non≠B-NonOSE_AE   hematologic≠I-NonOSE_AE  and Grade 4-5 hematologic  adverse≠I-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE  occurring at a higher incidence (>= 2%) in patients receiving Avastin with paclitaxel and carboplatin compared with patients receiving chemotherapy alone were  neutropenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (27% vs. 17%),  fatigue≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (16% vs. 13%),  hypertension≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (8% vs. 0.7%), infection without  neutropenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (7% vs. 3%),  venous≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   thromboembolism≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (5% vs. 3%),  febrile≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   neutropenia≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (5% vs. 2%),  pneumonitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE / pulmonary≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   infiltrates≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (5% vs. 3%), infection with Grade 3 or 4  neutropenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (4% vs. 2%),  hyponatremia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (4% vs. 1%),  headache≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (3% vs. 1%) and  proteinuria≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (3% vs. 0%).

     Recurrent Glioblastoma  

 EORTC 26101 was a multicenter, randomized, open-label study in patients with  recurrent≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   GBM≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  following radiotherapy and temozolomide of whom 278 patients received at least one dose of Avastin and are considered safety evaluable. Patients were randomized (2:1) to receive Avastin (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks) with lomustine or lomustine alone until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population. In the Avastin with lomustine arm, 22% of patients discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions compared with 10% of patients in the lomustine arm. In patients receiving Avastin with lomustine, the adverse reaction profile was similar to that observed in other approved indications.

   6.2 Immunogenicity

  As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for  immunogenicity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . The detection of  antibody≠B-NonOSE_AE   formation≠I-NonOSE_AE  is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of  antibody≠B-NonOSE_AE  (including neutralizing antibody)  positivity≠I-NonOSE_AE  in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of  antibodies≠B-NonOSE_AE   to≠I-NonOSE_AE   bevacizumab≠I-NonOSE_AE  in the studies described below with the incidence of  antibodies≠B-NonOSE_AE  in other studies or  to≠I-NonOSE_AE   other≠I-NonOSE_AE   products≠I-NonOSE_AE  may be misleading.

 In clinical studies for adjuvant treatment of a solid  tumor≠B-NonOSE_AE , 0.6% (14/2323) of patients tested positive for treatment-emergent  anti≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  bevacizumab≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   antibodies≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  as detected by an electrochemiluminescent (ECL) based assay. Among these 14 patients, three tested  positive≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   for≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   neutralizing≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   antibodies≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  against bevacizumab using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The clinical significance of these  anti≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  bevacizumab≠I-NonOSE_AE   antibodies≠I-NonOSE_AE  is not known.

   6.3 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Avastin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
