   WARNINGS

   Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk:

  Patients with  major≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depressive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   (≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  MDD≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their  depression≠B-NonOSE_AE  and/or the emergence of  suicidal≠B-NonOSE_AE   ideation≠I-NonOSE_AE  and behavior ( suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE ) or  unusual≠B-NonOSE_AE   changes≠I-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   behavior≠I-NonOSE_AE , whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs.  Suicide≠B-NonOSE_AE  is a known risk of  depression≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and certain other  psychiatric≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorders≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of  suicide≠B-NonOSE_AE . There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing  worsening≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   depression≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and the emergence of  suicidality≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of  suicidal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   thinking≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and behavior ( suicidality≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18-24) with  major≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depressive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   (≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  MDD≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ) and other  psychiatric≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorders≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE  with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.

 The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with  MDD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ,  obsessive≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   compulsive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   (≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  OCD≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ), or other  psychiatric≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorders≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4,400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with  MDD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or other  psychiatric≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorders≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of  suicidality≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE  across the different indications, with the highest incidence in  MDD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate . The risk differences (drug vs placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE  per 1,000 patients treated) are provided in Table 1.

 Table 1 
  Age Range      Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Cases of  Suicidality≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  per 1,000 Patients Treated

  18-24          5 additional cases                                                                  
  Decreases Compared to Placebo

  >=65           6 fewer cases                                                                       
        No  suicides≠B-NonOSE_AE  occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were  suicides≠B-NonOSE_AE  in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on  suicide≠B-NonOSE_AE .
 

 It is unknown whether the  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE  risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with  depression≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of  depression≠B-NonOSE_AE .

  All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening,  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE , and  unusual≠B-NonOSE_AE   changes≠I-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   behavior≠I-NonOSE_AE , especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases.  

 The following symptoms,  anxiety≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  agitation≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  panic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   attacks≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  insomnia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  irritability≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  hostility≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  aggressiveness≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  impulsivity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  akathisia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  ( psychomotor≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   restlessness≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ),  hypomania≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  mania≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for  major≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depressive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the  worsening≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   depression≠I-NonOSE_AE  and/or the emergence of  suicidal≠B-NonOSE_AE   impulses≠I-NonOSE_AE  has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE .

 Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose  depression≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE  or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening  depression≠B-NonOSE_AE  or  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE , especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.

 If the decision has been made to discontinue treatment, medication should be tapered, as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that abrupt discontinuation can be associated with certain symptoms (see  PRECAUTIONS  and  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  : Discontinuation of Treatment With PAXIL, for a description of the risks of discontinuation of PAXIL).

  Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for  major≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depressive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of  agitation≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  irritability≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  unusual≠B-NonOSE_AE   changes≠I-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   behavior≠I-NonOSE_AE , and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of  suicidality≠B-NonOSE_AE , and to report such symptoms immediately to healthcare providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers.  Prescriptions for PAXIL should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of  overdose≠B-NonOSE_AE .

    Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder:

  A  major≠B-NonOSE_AE   depressive≠I-NonOSE_AE   episode≠I-NonOSE_AE  may be the initial presentation of  bipolar≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of  precipitation≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   a≠I-NonOSE_AE   mixed≠I-NonOSE_AE  /≠I-NonOSE_AE  manic≠I-NonOSE_AE   episode≠I-NonOSE_AE  in patients at risk for  bipolar≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with  depressive≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   symptoms≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for  bipolar≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ; such screening should include a detailed  psychiatric≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  history, including a  family≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   history≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   of≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   suicide≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  bipolar≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , and  depression≠B-Not_AE_Candidate . It should be noted that PAXIL is not approved for use in treating  bipolar≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depression≠I-Not_AE_Candidate .

    Serotonin Syndrome:

  The development of a potentially life-threatening  serotonin≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   syndrome≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  has been reported with SNRIs and SSRIs, including PAXIL, alone but particularly with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John's Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat  psychiatric≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorders≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue).

  Serotonin≠B-NonOSE_AE   syndrome≠I-NonOSE_AE  symptoms may include  mental≠B-NonOSE_AE   status≠I-NonOSE_AE   changes≠I-NonOSE_AE  (e.g.,  agitation≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  hallucinations≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  delirium≠B-NonOSE_AE , and  coma≠B-NonOSE_AE ),  autonomic≠B-NonOSE_AE   instability≠I-NonOSE_AE  (e.g.,  tachycardia≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  labile≠B-NonOSE_AE   blood≠I-NonOSE_AE   pressure≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  dizziness≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  diaphoresis≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  flushing≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  hyperthermia≠B-NonOSE_AE ),  neuromuscular≠B-NonOSE_AE   symptoms≠I-NonOSE_AE  (e.g.,  tremor≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  rigidity≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  myoclonus≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  hyperreflexia≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  incoordination≠B-NonOSE_AE ),  seizures≠B-NonOSE_AE , and/or  gastrointestinal≠B-NonOSE_AE   symptoms≠I-NonOSE_AE  (e.g.,  nausea≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  vomiting≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  diarrhea≠B-NonOSE_AE ). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of  serotonin≠B-NonOSE_AE   syndrome≠I-NonOSE_AE .

 The concomitant use of PAXIL with MAOIs intended to treat  psychiatric≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorders≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  is contraindicated. PAXIL should also not be started in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. All reports with methylene blue that provided information on the route of administration involved intravenous administration in the dose range of 1 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection) or at lower doses. There may be circumstances when it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking PAXIL. PAXIL should be discontinued before initiating treatment with the MAOI (see  CONTRAINDICATIONS  and  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  ).

 If concomitant use of PAXIL with certain other serotonergic drugs, i.e., triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, buspirone, tryptophan, amphetamines, and St. John's Wort is clinically warranted, be aware of a potential increased risk for  serotonin≠B-NonOSE_AE   syndrome≠I-NonOSE_AE , particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases.

 Treatment with PAXIL and any concomitant serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately if the above events occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated.

    Angle-Closure Glaucoma:

  The  pupillary≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   dilation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including Paxil may trigger an  angle≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   closure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   attack≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  in a patient with  anatomically≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   narrow≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   angles≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  who does not have a patent iridectomy.

    Potential Interaction With Thioridazine:

   Thioridazine administration alone produces  prolongation≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   the≠I-NonOSE_AE   QTc≠I-NonOSE_AE   interval≠I-NonOSE_AE , which is associated with serious  ventricular≠B-NonOSE_AE   arrhythmias≠I-NonOSE_AE , such as  torsade≠B-NonOSE_AE   de≠I-NonOSE_AE   pointes≠I-NonOSE_AE   - type  arrhythmias≠B-NonOSE_AE , and  sudden≠B-NonOSE_AE   death≠I-NonOSE_AE . This effect appears to be dose related.  

  An   in vivo   study suggests that drugs which inhibit CYP2D6, such as paroxetine, will elevate plasma levels of thioridazine. Therefore, it is recommended that paroxetine not be used in combination with thioridazine (see  CONTRAINDICATIONS  and  PRECAUTIONS  ).  

    Usage in Pregnancy:

     Teratogenic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   Effects≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE :  

  Epidemiological studies have shown that  infants≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   exposed≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   to≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   paroxetine≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   the≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   first≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   trimester≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   pregnancy≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  have an increased risk of  congenital≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   malformations≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , particularly cardiovascular malformations. The findings from these studies are summarized below:

 *    A study based on Swedish national registry data demonstrated that  infants≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   exposed≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   to≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   paroxetine≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   during≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   pregnancy≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  n≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   =≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   8≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  1≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  5≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  )≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   had≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   an≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   increased≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   risk≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   cardiovascular≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   malformations≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (2% risk in paroxetine-exposed infants) compared to the entire registry population (1% risk), for an odds ratio (OR) of 1.8 (95% confidence interval 1.1 to 2.8). No increase in the risk of  overall≠B-NonOSE_AE   congenital≠I-NonOSE_AE   malformations≠I-NonOSE_AE  was seen in the paroxetine-exposed infants. The  cardiac≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   malformations≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   the≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   paroxetine≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  exposed≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infants≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  were primarily  ventricular≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   septal≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   defects≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  VSDs≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ) and  atrial≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   septal≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   defects≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  ASDs≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ).  Septal≠B-NonOSE_AE   defects≠I-NonOSE_AE  range in severity from those that resolve spontaneously to those which require surgery. 
 *    A separate retrospective cohort study from the United States (United Healthcare data) evaluated 5,956 infants of mothers dispensed antidepressants during the first trimester (n = 815 for paroxetine). This study showed a trend towards an increased risk for  cardiovascular≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   malformations≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  for paroxetine (risk of 1.5%) compared to other antidepressants (risk of 1%), for an OR of 1.5 (95% confidence interval 0.8 to 2.9). Of the 12  paroxetine≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  exposed≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infants≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   with≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   cardiovascular≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   malformations≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , 9 had  VSDs≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . This study also suggested an increased risk of overall major  congenital≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   malformations≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  including cardiovascular defects for paroxetine (4% risk) compared to other (2% risk) antidepressants (OR 1.8; 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 2.8). 
 *    Two large case-control studies using separate databases, each with >9,000  birth≠B-NonOSE_AE   defect≠I-NonOSE_AE  cases and >4,000 controls, found that maternal use of paroxetine during the first trimester of pregnancy was associated with a 2- to 3-fold increased risk of  right≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   ventricular≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   outflow≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   tract≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   obstructions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . In one study the odds ratio was 2.5 (95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 6.0, 7 exposed infants) and in the other study the odds ratio was 3.3 (95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 8.8, 6 exposed infants). 
    Other studies have found varying results as to whether there was an increased risk of overall,  cardiovascular≠B-NonOSE_AE , or specific  congenital≠I-NonOSE_AE   malformations≠I-NonOSE_AE . A meta-analysis of epidemiological data over a 16-year period (1992 to 2008) on first trimester paroxetine use in  pregnancy≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and  congenital≠B-NonOSE_AE   malformations≠I-NonOSE_AE  included the above-noted studies in addition to others (n = 17 studies that included overall  malformations≠B-NonOSE_AE  and n = 14 studies that included  cardiovascular≠B-NonOSE_AE   malformations≠I-NonOSE_AE ; n = 20 distinct studies). While subject to limitations, this meta-analysis suggested an increased occurrence of  cardiovascular≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   malformations≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (prevalence odds ratio [POR] 1.5; 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 1.9) and overall  malformations≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (POR 1.2; 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 1.4) with paroxetine use during the first trimester. It was not possible in this meta-analysis to determine the extent to which the observed prevalence of  cardiovascular≠B-NonOSE_AE   malformations≠I-NonOSE_AE  might have contributed to that of overall  malformations≠B-NonOSE_AE , nor was it possible to determine whether any specific types of  cardiovascular≠B-NonOSE_AE   malformations≠I-NonOSE_AE  might have contributed to the observed prevalence of all  cardiovascular≠B-NonOSE_AE   malformations≠I-NonOSE_AE .
 

 If a patient becomes  pregnant≠B-NonOSE_AE  while taking paroxetine, she should be advised of the potential  harm≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   to≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   the≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   fetus≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . Unless the benefits of paroxetine to the mother justify continuing treatment, consideration should be given to either discontinuing paroxetine therapy or switching to another antidepressant (see  PRECAUTIONS  :  Discontinuation of Treatment With PAXIL   )  . For women who intend to become  pregnant≠B-NonOSE_AE  or are in their first trimester of  pregnancy≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , paroxetine should only be initiated after consideration of the other available treatment options.

     Animal Findings:  

  Reproduction studies were performed at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day in rats and 6 mg/kg/day in rabbits administered during organogenesis. These doses are approximately 8 (rat) and 2 (rabbit) times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) on an mg/m  2  basis. These studies have revealed no evidence of  teratogenic≠B-NonOSE_AE   effects≠I-NonOSE_AE . However, in rats, there was an increase in pup deaths during the first 4 days of lactation when dosing occurred during the last trimester of gestation and continued throughout lactation. This effect occurred at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day or approximately one-sixth of the MRHD on an mg/m  2  basis. The no-effect dose for rat pup mortality was not determined. The cause of these  deaths≠B-NonOSE_AE  is not known.

     Nonteratogenic Effects:  

   Neonates≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  exposed to PAXIL and other SSRIs or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization,  respiratory≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory  distress≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These features are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs and SNRIs or, possibly, a  drug≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   discontinuation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   syndrome≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with  serotonin≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   syndrome≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (see  WARNINGS  :   Serotonin≠B-NonOSE_AE   Syndrome≠I-NonOSE_AE   ).

 Infants exposed to SSRIs in pregnancy may have an increased risk for persistent  pulmonary≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   hypertension≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   the≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   newborn≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  PPHN≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ).  PPHN≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurs in 1 - 2 per 1,000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and  mortality≠B-NonOSE_AE . Several recent epidemiologic studies suggest a positive statistical association between SSRI use (including PAXIL) in  pregnancy≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and  PPHN≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . Other studies do not show a significant statistical association.

 Physicians should also note the results of a prospective longitudinal study of 201  pregnant≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  women with a history of  major≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depression≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , who were either on antidepressants or had received antidepressants less than 12 weeks prior to their last menstrual period, and were in remission. Women who discontinued antidepressant medication during  pregnancy≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  showed a significant increase in relapse of their major  depression≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  compared to those women who remained on antidepressant medication throughout  pregnancy≠B-Not_AE_Candidate .

 When treating a  pregnant≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  woman with PAXIL, the physician should carefully consider both the potential risks of taking an SSRI, along with the established benefits of treating  depression≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  with an antidepressant. This decision can only be made on a case by case basis (see  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  and  ADVERSE REACTIONS  :  Postmarketing Reports  ).
