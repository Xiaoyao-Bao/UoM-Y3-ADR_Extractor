  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



   Opioid-Induced Constipation in Adult Patients with Chronic Non-Cancer Pain  



 The safety of RELISTOR was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adult patients with  opioid≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  induced≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   constipation≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and  chronic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   non≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   pain≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  receiving opioid analgesia. This study (Study 1) included a 4-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled period in which adult patients were randomized to receive RELISTOR 12 mg once daily (150 patients) or placebo (162 patients) [  see    Clinical Studies (    14.1        )  ]. After 4 weeks of double-blind treatment, patients began an 8-week open-label treatment period during which RELISTOR 12 mg was administered less frequently than the recommended dosage regimen of 12 mg once daily.



 Adverse reactions in adult patients with  opioid≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  induced≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   constipation≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and  chronic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   non≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   pain≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  receiving RELISTOR are shown in Table 2. The adverse reactions in the table below may reflect symptoms of  opioid≠B-NonOSE_AE   withdrawal≠I-NonOSE_AE .

 During the 4-week double-blind period, in patients with  opioid≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  induced≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   constipation≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and  chronic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   non≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   pain≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  that received RELISTOR 12 mg every other day, there was a higher incidence of adverse reactions, including  nausea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (12%),  diarrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (12%),  vomiting≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (7%),  tremor≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (3%),  feeling≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   body≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   temperature≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   change≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (3%),  piloerection≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (3%), and  chills≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (2%) as compared to daily Relistor dosing.  Use of RELISTOR 12 mg every other day is not recommended in patients with  OIC≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and  chronic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   non≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   pain≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]  . The rates of discontinuation due to adverse reactions during the double-blind period (Study 1) were higher in the RELISTOR once daily (7%) than the placebo group (3%).   Abdominal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  was the most common adverse reaction resulting in discontinuation from the double-blind period in the RELISTOR once daily group (2%).



 The safety of RELISTOR was also evaluated in a 48-week, open-label, uncontrolled trial in 1034 adult patients with  opioid≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  induced≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   constipation≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and  chronic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   non≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   pain≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  (Study 2). Patients were allowed to administer RELISTOR 12 mg less frequently than the recommended dosage regimen of 12 mg once daily, and took a median of 6 doses per week. A total of 624 patients (60%) completed at least 24 weeks of treatment and 477 (46%) completed the 48-week study. The adverse reactions seen in this study were similar to those observed during the 4-week double-blind period of Study 1. Additionally, in Study 2, investigators reported 4  myocardial≠B-NonOSE_AE   infarctions≠I-NonOSE_AE  (1  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE ), 1  stroke≠B-NonOSE_AE  ( fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE ), 1  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE   cardiac≠B-NonOSE_AE   arrest≠I-NonOSE_AE  and 1  sudden≠B-NonOSE_AE   death≠I-NonOSE_AE . It is not possible to establish a relationship between these events and RELISTOR.



   Opioid-Induced Constipation in Adult Patients with Advanced Illness  



 The safety of RELISTOR was evaluated in two, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adult patients with  opioid≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  induced≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   constipation≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and advanced illness receiving palliative care: Study 3 included a single-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled period, whereas Study 4 included a 14-day multiple dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled period [see  Clinical Studies (    14        .2        )  ]. 



 The most common (>= 5%) adverse reactions in adult patients with  opioid≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  induced≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   constipation≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and advanced illness receiving RELISTOR are shown in Table 3 below.

  * Adverse reactions occuring in >= 5% of patients receiving all doses of RELISTOR (0.075, 0.15, and 0.30 mg/kg/dose) and at an incidence greater than placebo.    
         The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events during the double-blind placebo controlled clinical trials (Study 3 and Study 4) were comparable between RELISTOR (1%) and placebo (2%).
 

   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of RELISTOR. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
