  6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

   EXCERPT:    *  Most of the safety experience is with sevelamer tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride. In long-term studies with sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, the most common adverse events included: vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%), and constipation (8%).

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

 There are limited clinical trial data on the safety of Renvela. However, because it contains the same active ingredient as the hydrochloride salt, the adverse event profiles of the two salts are expected to be similar. In a cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of eight weeks each and no washout, and another cross-over study in hemodialysis patients with treatment durations of four weeks each and no washout between treatment periods, the adverse reactions on sevelamer carbonate powder were similar to those reported for sevelamer hydrochloride.

 In a parallel design study of sevelamer hydrochloride with treatment duration of 52 weeks, adverse reactions reported for sevelamer hydrochloride (n=99) were similar to those reported for the active-comparator group (n=101). Overall adverse reactions among those treated with sevelamer hydrochloride occurring in >5% of patients included:  vomiting≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (22%),  nausea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (20%),  diarrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (19%),  dyspepsia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (16%),  abdominal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (9%),  flatulence≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (8%), and  constipation≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (8%). A total of 27 patients treated with sevelamer and 10 patients treated with comparator withdrew from the study due to adverse reactions.

 Based on studies of 8-52 weeks, the most common reason for withdrawal from sevelamer hydrochloride was  gastrointestinal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   adverse≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (3%-16%).

 In 143 peritoneal dialysis patients studied for 12 weeks using sevelamer hydrochloride, most common adverse reactions were similar to adverse reactions observed in hemodialysis patients. The most frequently occurring treatment emergent serious adverse reaction was  peritonitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (8 reactions in 8 patients [8%] in the sevelamer group and 2 reactions in 2 patients [4%] on active control). Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for  gastrointestinal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   adverse≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE .

   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

 The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sevelamer hydrochloride or sevelamer carbonate:  hypersensitivity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  pruritus≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  rash≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  abdominal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  fecal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   impaction≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and uncommon cases of  ileus≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  intestinal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   obstruction≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  intestinal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   perforation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . Appropriate medical management should be given to patients who develop  constipation≠B-NonOSE_AE  or have worsening of existing  constipation≠B-NonOSE_AE  to avoid severe complications.
