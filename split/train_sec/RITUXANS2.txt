    Infusion Reactions  

   Rituxan administration can result in serious, including  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE   infusion≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE .  Deaths≠B-NonOSE_AE  within 24 hours of Rituxan infusion have occurred. Approximately 80% of  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE   infusion≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred in association with the first infusion. Monitor patients closely. Discontinue Rituxan infusion for severe reactions and provide medical treatment for Grade 3 or 4  infusion≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE  [  see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ,   Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ].          

   Severe Mucocutaneous Reactions  

   Severe, including  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  mucocutaneous≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  can occur in patients receiving Rituxan [  see   Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ,   Adverse Reactions (6)    ].          

   Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Reactivation  

    HBV≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactivation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  can occur in patients treated with Rituxan, in some cases resulting in fulminant  hepatitis≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  hepatic≠B-NonOSE_AE   failure≠I-NonOSE_AE , and  death≠B-NonOSE_AE . Screen all patients for  HBV≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   infection≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  before treatment initiation, and monitor patients during and after treatment with Rituxan. Discontinue Rituxan and concomitant medications in the event of  HBV≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactivation≠I-NonOSE_AE  [  see   Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ,   Adverse Reactions (6)    ].
