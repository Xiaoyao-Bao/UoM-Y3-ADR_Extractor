  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions and varying lengths of time, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect rates observed in practice.



 The most commonly observed adverse reactions in VIIBRYD-treated patients with  major≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   depressive≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  (MDD) in placebo-controlled studies (incidence >= 5% and at least twice the rate of placebo) were  diarrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  nausea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  vomiting≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  insomnia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .



     Patient Exposure  



 The safety of VIIBRYD was evaluated in 3,007 patients (18-70 years of age) diagnosed with  MDD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  who participated in clinical studies, representing 676 patient-years of exposure. In an open-label 52 week study at 40 mg daily, 599 patients were exposed to VIIBRYD for a total of 348 patient-years.



 The adverse reaction information presented below was derived from studies of VIIBRYD 20 mg and 40 mg daily in patients with MDD including:



 *  Four placebo-controlled 8 to 10-week studies in 2,233 patients, including 1,266 VIIBRYD-treated patients; and 
 *  An open-label 52-week study of 599 VIIBRYD-treated patients. 
    These studies included a titration period of 10 mg daily for 7 days, followed by 20 mg daily for 7 days or to 40 mg daily over 2 weeks. In these clinical trials, VIIBRYD was administered with food.
 

     Adverse reactions reported as reasons for discontinuation of treatment  



 In these studies, 7.3% of the VIIBRYD-treated patients discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction, compared with 3.5% of placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation in at least 1% of the VIIBRYD-treated patients in the placebo-controlled studies was  nausea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (1.4%).



     Common adverse reactions in placebo-controlled MDD studies  



   Table 2  shows the incidence of common adverse reactions occuring in >= 2% of VIIBRYD-treated patients and greater than the rate of placebo-treated patients in MDD Studies. There were no dose-related adverse reactions between 20 mg and 40 mg reported.

 The following list does not include reactions: 1) already listed in previous tables or elsewhere in labeling, 2) for which a drug cause was remote, 3) which were so general as to be uninformative, 4) which were not considered to have significant clinical implications, or 5) which occurred at a rate equal to or less than placebo.



 Reactions are categorized by body system according to the following definitions:  frequent  adverse reactions are those occurring in at least 1/100 patients;  infrequent  adverse reactions are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients;  rare  reactions are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients:

      6.2 Post-marketing Experience
   The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of VIIBRYD. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Reports of adverse reactions temporally associated with VIIBRYD that have been received since market introduction and that are not listed above include the following:
