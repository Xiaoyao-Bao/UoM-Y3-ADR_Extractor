  6.1       Clinical Trial Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of other drugs and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

   Patients    with Chronic Kidney Disease  

   Adult Patients  

 Adverse reactions were determined based on pooled data from 5 randomized, active-controlled studies of Aranesp with a total of 1357 patients (Aranesp 766, epoetin alfa 591). The median duration of exposure for patients receiving Aranesp was 340 days, with 580 patients exposed for greater than 6 months and 360 patients exposed for greater than 1 year. The median (25th, 75th percentiles) weight-adjusted dose of Aranesp was 0.50 mcg/kg (0.32, 0.81). The median (range) age for patients administered Aranesp was 62 years (18 to 88). In the Aranesp group, 55% were male, 72% were white, 83% were receiving dialysis, and 17% were not receiving dialysis.

 Table 5 lists adverse reactions occurring in >= 5% of patients treated with Aranesp.

        Rates of adverse reactions with Aranesp therapy were similar to those observed with other recombinant erythropoietins in these studies.
 

   Pediatric Patients  

 Adverse reactions were determined based on pooled data from 2 randomized, controlled trials   [see Clinical Studies (      14.1      )]  . In one study, Aranesp was administered to 81 pediatric patients with  CKD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  who had stable hemoglobin concentrations while previously receiving epoetin alfa. In a second study, Aranesp was administered to 114 anemic pediatric patients with  CKD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  receiving or not receiving dialysis for initial treatment of  anemia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate . In these studies, the most frequently reported serious adverse reactions with Aranesp were  hypertension≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  convulsions≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . The most commonly reported adverse reactions were  hypertension≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  injection≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   site≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  rash≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  convulsions≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . Aranesp administration was discontinued because of  injection≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   site≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  in 2 patients and  hypertension≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  in 3 patients.

   Patients    with    Cancer    Receiving Chemotherapy  

 Adverse reactions were based on data from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of Aranesp in 597 patients (Aranesp 301, placebo 296) with extensive stage  small≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   cell≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   lung≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   (≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  SCLC≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ) receiving platinum-based chemotherapy. All patients were white, 64% were male, and the median age was 61 years (range: 28 to 82 years); 25% of the study population were from North America, Western Europe, and Australia. Patients received Aranesp at a dose of 300 mcg or placebo weekly for 4 weeks then every 3 weeks for a total of 24 weeks, and the median duration of exposure was 19 weeks (range: 1 to 26 weeks).

 Adverse reactions     were also based on     data from 7 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, including the SCLC study described above, that enrolled 2112 patients (Aranesp 1203, placebo 909) with  non≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  myeloid≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   malignancies≠I-Not_AE_Candidate .  Most patients were white (95%), male (52%), and the median age was 63 years (range: 18 to 91 years); 73% of the study population were from North America, Western Europe, and Australia.  Dosing and schedules varied by study from once weekly to once every 4 weeks, and the median duration of exposure was 12 weeks (range: 1 to 27 weeks).

Events in this category may also be included under  "≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  thromboembolic≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   adverse≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ."
 

 In addition to the  thrombovascular≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   adverse≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  abdominal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  edema≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred at a higher incidence in patients taking Aranesp compared to patients on placebo.  Among all placebo-controlled studies,  abdominal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (13.2% vs. 9.4%) and  edema≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (12.8% vs. 9.7%) were reported more frequently in patients receiving Aranesp compared to the placebo group.  In the  SCLC≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  study the incidence of  abdominal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (10.3% vs. 3.4%) and  edema≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (5.6% vs. 5.1%) in the Aranesp-treated patients compared to those receiving placebo.

   6.2       Postmarketing Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of Aranesp.

 Because postmarketing reporting of adverse reactions is voluntary and from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

 *   Seizures≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  [  see Warnings and Precautions (    5.4    )  ]  
 *   PRCA≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  [  see Warnings and Precautions (    5.6    )  ]  
 *  Serious  allergic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   [  see Warnings and Precautions (    5.7    )  ]  
 *  Severe  Cutaneous≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   Reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  [see Warnings and Precautions (    5.8    )]  
      6.3       Immunogenicity
   As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for  immunogenicity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .

 In clinical studies, the percentage of patients with  antibodies≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   to≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   Aranesp≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  was examined using the Biacore  (r)  assay. Sera from 1501 patients with  CKD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and 1159 patients with  cancer≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  were tested. At baseline, prior to Aranesp treatment,  binding≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   antibodies≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   were≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   detected≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  in 59 patients (4%) with  CKD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and 36 patients with  cancer≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  (3%). During Aranesp therapy (range: 22 to 177 weeks), a follow-up sample was taken. One additional patient with  CKD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and 8 additional patients with  cancer≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  developed  antibodies≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   capable≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   binding≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   Aranesp≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . In two studies of pediatric patients with  CKD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  aged 2-16, 20 of 111 patients with  CKD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  (18%) receiving dialysis and 6 of 69 patients (9%) not receiving dialysis had  anti≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  ESA≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   antibodies≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  at baseline. During therapy, 4 additional patients receiving dialysis and 4 additional patients not receiving dialysis developed  antibodies≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   capable≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   binding≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   Aranesp≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE .

 None of the patients had  antibodies≠B-NonOSE_AE   capable≠I-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   neutralizing≠I-NonOSE_AE   the≠I-NonOSE_AE   activity≠I-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   Aranesp≠I-NonOSE_AE  or endogenous erythropoietin at baseline or at end of study. No clinical sequelae consistent with  PRCA≠B-NonOSE_AE  were associated with the  presence≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE  these  antibodies≠I-NonOSE_AE .

 The incidence of  antibody≠B-NonOSE_AE   formation≠I-NonOSE_AE  is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of  antibody≠B-NonOSE_AE  (including neutralizing a ntibody≠B-NonOSE_AE  )≠I-NonOSE_AE    positivity≠I-NonOSE_AE  ≠≠I-NonOSE_AE I-NonOSE_AE  in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of  antibodies≠B-NonOSE_AE   to≠I-NonOSE_AE   Aranesp≠I-NonOSE_AE  with the incidence of  antibodies≠B-NonOSE_AE   to≠I-NonOSE_AE   other≠I-NonOSE_AE   products≠I-NonOSE_AE  may be misleading.
