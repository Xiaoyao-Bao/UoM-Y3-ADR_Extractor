    6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

  EXCERPT:   The most common adverse reactions occurring at least 3% more frequently than on placebo are mild local reactions at the site of injection. (  6  )

  6.1 Clinical Study Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 In 5 controlled randomized clinical trials, Asclera has been administered to 401 patients with small or very small  varicose≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   veins≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  ( reticular≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and spider  veins≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ) and compared with another sclerosing agent and with placebo. Patients were 18 to 70 years old. The patient population was predominately female and consisted of Caucasian and Asian patients.



 Table 1 shows adverse events more common with Asclera or sodium tetradecyl sulfate (STS) 1% than with placebo by at least 3% in the placebo- controlled EASI study  (see  Clinical Studies [14]  )  . All of these were  injection≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   site≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and most were mild.

   6.2 Post-marketing Safety Experience

  The following adverse reactions have been reported during use of polidocanol in world-wide experience; in some of these cases these adverse events have been serious or troublesome. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size and without a control group, it is not possible to estimate their frequency reliably or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
