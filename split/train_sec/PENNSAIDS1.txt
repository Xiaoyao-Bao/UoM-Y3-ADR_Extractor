  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

 The data described below reflect exposure to PENNSAID of 130 patients treated for 4 weeks (mean duration of 28 days) in one Phase 2 controlled trial. This population's mean age was approximately 60 years, 85% of patients were Caucasian, 65% were females, and all patients had primary  osteoarthritis≠B-Not_AE_Candidate . The most common adverse events with PENNSAID were  application≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   site≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   skin≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . These events were the most common reason for withdrawing from the study.

     Application Site Reactions:  

 In this controlled trial,  application≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   site≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  were characterized by one or more of the following: dryness (22%), exfoliation (7%), erythema (4%), pruritus (2%), pain (2%), induration (2%), rash (2%), and scabbing (<1%).

     Other Common Adverse Reactions:  

 Table 1 lists all adverse reactions occurring in >1% of patients receiving PENNSAID, where the rate in the PENNSAID group exceeded vehicle, from a controlled study conducted in patients with  osteoarthritis≠B-Not_AE_Candidate .

             PENNSAID 1.5%  
 

 The safety of PENNSAID 2% is based in part, on prior experience with PENNSAID 1.5%. The data described below reflect exposure to PENNSAID 1.5% of 911 patients treated between 4 and 12 weeks (mean duration of 49 days) in seven Phase 3 controlled trials, as well as exposure of 793 patients treated in an open-label study, including 463 patients treated for at least 6 months, and 144 patients treated for at least 12 months. The population mean age was approximately 60 years, 89% of patients were Caucasian, 64% were females, and all patients had primary  osteoarthritis≠B-Not_AE_Candidate . The most common adverse events with PENNSAID 1.5% were  application≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   site≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   skin≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . These events were the most common reason for withdrawing from the studies.

     Application Site Reactions:  

 In controlled trials,  application≠B-NonOSE_AE   site≠I-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE  were characterized by one or more of the following: dryness, erythema, induration, vesicles, paresthesia, pruritus, vasodilation, acne, and urticaria. The most frequent of these reactions were  dry≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   skin≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (32%),  contact≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   dermatitis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  characterized by  skin≠B-NonOSE_AE   erythema≠I-NonOSE_AE  and  induration≠B-NonOSE_AE  (9%),  contact≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   dermatitis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   with≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   vesicles≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (2%) and pruritus (4%). In one controlled trial, a higher rate of  contact≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   dermatitis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   with≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   vesicles≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (4%) was observed after treatment of 152 subjects with the combination of PENNSAID 1.5% and oral diclofenac. In the open-label uncontrolled long-term safety study,  contact≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   dermatitis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred in 13% and  contact≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   dermatitis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   with≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   vesicles≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  in 10% of patients, generally within the first 6 months of exposure, leading to a withdrawal rate for an application site event of 14%.

     Other Common Adverse Reactions:  

 In controlled trials, subjects treated with PENNSAID 1.5% experienced some adverse events associated with the NSAID class more frequently than subjects using placebo ( constipation≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  diarrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  dyspepsia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  nausea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  flatulence≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  abdominal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  edema≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ; see  Table 2  ). The combination of PENNSAID 1.5% and oral diclofenac, compared to oral diclofenac alone, resulted in a higher rate of  rectal≠B-NonOSE_AE   hemorrhage≠I-NonOSE_AE  (3% vs. less than 1%), and more frequent  abnormal≠B-NonOSE_AE   creatinine≠I-NonOSE_AE  (12% vs. 7%), urea (20% vs. 12%), and hemoglobin (13% vs. 9%), but no difference in  elevation≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   liver≠I-NonOSE_AE   transaminases≠I-NonOSE_AE .

 Table 2 lists all adverse reactions occurring in >=1% of patients receiving PENNSAID 1.5%, where the rate in the PENNSAID 1.5% group exceeded placebo, from seven controlled studies conducted in patients with  osteoarthritis≠B-Not_AE_Candidate . Since these trials were of different durations, these percentages do not capture cumulative rates of occurrence.

           6.2 Postmarketing Experience
   In postmarketing surveillance, the following adverse reactions have been reported during post- approval use of PENNSAID 1.5%. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
