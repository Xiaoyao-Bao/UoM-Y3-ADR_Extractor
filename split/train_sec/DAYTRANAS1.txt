    The most commonly reported (frequency >= 5% and twice the rate of placebo) adverse reactions in a controlled trial in children aged 6-12 included  appetite≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   decreased≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  insomnia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  nausea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  vomiting≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  weight≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   decreased≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  tic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  affect≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   lability≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  anorexia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . The most commonly reported (frequency >= 5% and twice the rate of placebo) adverse reactions in a controlled trial in adolescents aged 13-17 were  appetite≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   decreased≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  nausea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  insomnia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  weight≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   decreased≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  dizziness≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  abdominal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  anorexia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  [    see Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .
 

 The most common (>= 2% of subjects) adverse reaction associated with discontinuations in double-blind clinical trials in children or adolescents was  application≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   site≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  [    see Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .

 The overall Daytrana development program included exposure to Daytrana in a total of 2,152 participants in clinical trials, including 1,529 children aged 6-12, 223 adolescents aged 13-17, and 400 adults. The 1,752 child and adolescent subjects aged 6-17 years were evaluated in 10 controlled clinical studies, 7 open-label clinical studies, and 5 clinical pharmacology studies. In a combined studies pool of children using Daytrana with a wear time of 9 hours, 212 subjects were exposed for >= 6 months and 115 were exposed for >= 1 year; 85 adolescents have been exposed for >= 6 months. Most patients studied were exposed to Daytrana patch sizes of 12.5 cm  2  , 18.75 cm  2  , 25 cm  2  or 37.5 cm  2  , with a wear time of 9 hours.

 In the data presented below, the adverse reactions reported during exposure were obtained primarily by general inquiry at each visit, and were recorded by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse reactions without first grouping similar types of events into a smaller number of standardized event categories.

 Throughout this section adverse reactions reported are events that were considered to be reasonably associated with the use of Daytrana based on comprehensive assessment of the available adverse event information. A causal association for Daytrana often cannot be reliably established in individual cases. Further, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

    EXCERPT:    *  Children (ages 6-12): The most commonly (>=5% and twice the rate of placebo) reported adverse reactions in a placebo-controlled trial in children aged 6-12 included appetite decreased, insomnia, nausea, vomiting, weight decreased, tic, affect lability, and anorexia (  6.1  ). 
 *  Adolescents (ages 13-17): The most commonly (>=5% and twice the rate of placebo) reported adverse reactions in a placebo-controlled trial in adolescents aged 13-17 included appetite decreased, nausea, insomnia, weight decreased, dizziness, abdominal pain, and anorexia. The majority of subjects in these trials had erythema at the application site (  6.1  ). 
 *  The most common (>=2% of subjects) adverse reaction associated with discontinuations in controlled clinical trials in children or adolescents was application site reactions (  6.1  ).

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Adverse Reactions Associated With Discontinuation of Treatment

 In a 7-week double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study in children with  ADHD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  conducted in the outpatient setting, 7.1% (7/98) of patients treated with Daytrana discontinued due to adverse events compared with 1.2% (1/85) receiving placebo. The most commonly reported (>= 1% and twice the rate of placebo) adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in the Daytrana group were  application≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   site≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   reaction≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (2%),  tics≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (1%),  headache≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (1%), and  irritability≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (1%).

 In a 7-week double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study in adolescents with  ADHD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  conducted in the outpatient setting, 5.5% (8/145) of patients treated with Daytrana discontinued due to adverse reactions compared with 2.8% (2/72) receiving placebo. The most commonly reported adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in the Daytrana group were  application≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   site≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   reaction≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (2%) and  decreased≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   appetite≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE / anorexia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (1.4%).

 Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions in Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trials

    Skin≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   Irritation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  Application≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   Site≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   Reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   

 Daytrana is a  dermal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   irritant≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . In addition to the most commonly reported adverse reactions presented in Table 2, the majority of subjects in those studies had minimal to definite  skin≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   erythema≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   at≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   the≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   patch≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   application≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   site≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . This  erythema≠B-NonOSE_AE  generally caused no or minimal discomfort and did not usually interfere with therapy or result in discontinuation from treatment.  Erythema≠B-NonOSE_AE  is not by itself a manifestation of  contact≠B-NonOSE_AE   sensitization≠I-NonOSE_AE . However,  contact≠B-NonOSE_AE   sensitization≠I-NonOSE_AE  should be suspected if  erythema≠B-NonOSE_AE  is accompanied by evidence of a more intense  local≠B-NonOSE_AE   reaction≠I-NonOSE_AE  ( edema≠I-NonOSE_AE , papules, vesicles) that does not significantly improve within 48 hours or spreads beyond the patch site [    see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)    ].

   Most Commonly Reported Adverse Reactions  

 Table 2 lists treatment-emergent adverse reactions reported in >= 1% Daytrana-treated children or adolescents with ADHD in two 7 week double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled studies conducted in the outpatient setting. Overall, in these studies, 75.5% of children and 78.6% of adolescents experienced at least 1 adverse event.

           Adverse Reactions With the Long-Term Use of Daytrana
 

 In a long-term open-label study of up to 12 months duration in 326 children wearing Daytrana 9 hours daily, the most common (>= 10%) adverse reactions were  decreased≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   appetite≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  headache≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  weight≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   decreased≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . A total of 30 subjects (9.2%) were withdrawn from the study due to adverse events and 22 additional subjects (6.7%) discontinued treatment as the result of an  application≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   site≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   reaction≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . Other than  application≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   site≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  affect≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   lability≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (5 subjects, 1.5%) was the only additional adverse reaction leading to discontinuation reported with a frequency of greater than 1%.

 In a long-term open-label study of up to 6 months duration in 162 adolescents wearing Daytrana 9 hours daily, the most common (>= 10%) adverse reactions were  decreased≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   appetite≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  headache≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . A total of 9 subjects (5.5%) were withdrawn from the study due to adverse events and 3 additional subjects (1.9%) discontinued treatment as the result of an  application≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   site≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   reaction≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . Other adverse reactions leading to discontinuation that occurred with a frequency of greater than 1% included affect lability and irritability (2 subjects each, 1.2%).

   6.2 Postmarketing Experience

  In addition, the following adverse reactions have been identified during the postapproval use of Daytrana. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to Daytrana exposure.

In a single report, a ten-year-old boy who had been taking methylphenidate for approximately 18 months experienced an  NMS≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  like≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   event≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  within 45 minutes of ingesting his first dose of venlafaxine. It is uncertain whether this case represented a drug-drug interaction, a response to either drug alone, or some other cause.
