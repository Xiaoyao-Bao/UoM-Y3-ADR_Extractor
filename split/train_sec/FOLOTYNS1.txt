    The most common adverse reactions observed in patients with  peripheral≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   T≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  cell≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   lymphoma≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  (PTCL) treated with FOLOTYN were  mucositis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  thrombocytopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  nausea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  fatigue≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .
 

   EXCERPT:   Most common adverse reactions (>35%) are mucositis, thrombocytopenia, nausea, and fatigue. Most common serious adverse reactions are pyrexia, mucositis, sepsis, febrile neutropenia, dehydration, dyspnea, and thrombocytopenia. (  6.1  )

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 The safety of FOLOTYN was evaluated in 111  PTCL≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  patients in a single-arm clinical study in which patients received a starting dose of 30 mg/m  2  once weekly for 6 weeks in 7-week cycles. The median duration of treatment was 70 days (range 1-540 days).

                 Serious Adverse Events  
 

 Forty-four percent of patients (n = 49) experienced a serious adverse event while on study or within 30 days after their last dose of FOLOTYN. The most common serious adverse events (> 3%), regardless of causality, were  pyrexia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  mucositis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  sepsis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  febrile≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   neutropenia≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  dehydration≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  dyspnea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  thrombocytopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . One  death≠B-NonOSE_AE  from  cardiopulmonary≠B-NonOSE_AE   arrest≠I-NonOSE_AE  in a patient with  mucositis≠B-NonOSE_AE  and  febrile≠B-NonOSE_AE   neutropenia≠I-NonOSE_AE  was reported in this trial.  Deaths≠B-NonOSE_AE  from  mucositis≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  febrile≠B-NonOSE_AE   neutropenia≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  sepsis≠B-NonOSE_AE , and  pancytopenia≠B-NonOSE_AE  occurred in 1.2% of patients treated on all FOLOTYN trials at doses ranging from 30 to 325 mg/m  2  .



     Discontinuations  



 Twenty-three percent of patients (n = 25) discontinued treatment with FOLOTYN due to adverse reactions. The adverse reactions reported most frequently as the reason for discontinuation of treatment were  mucositis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (6%, n = 7) and  thrombocytopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (5%, n = 5).



     Dose Modifications  



 The target dose of FOLOTYN was 30 mg/m  2  once weekly for 6 weeks in 7-week cycles. The majority of patients (69%, n = 77) remained at the target dose for the duration of treatment. Overall, 85% of scheduled doses were administered.



   6.2 Post Marketing Experience

  Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.



     Dermatologic Reactions  



  Toxic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   epidermal≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   necrolysis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , sometimes  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE , has been reported during post-marketing use of FOLOTYN.  Fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE  cases have been reported following the first dose of FOLOTYN, including when a reduced dose is given, and have been reported in patients with  end≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  stage≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   renal≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  undergoing dialysis [  see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  ), Use in Specific Populations (  8.7  ), and Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )  ].
