  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 BRILINTA has been evaluated for safety in more than 27000 patients, including more than 13000 patients treated for at least 1 year.

 Frequency of  bleeding≠B-NonOSE_AE  in PLATO is summarized in Tables 1 and 2. About half of the Non-CABG major  bleeding≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  events were in the first 30 days.

         No baseline demographic factor altered the relative risk of  bleeding≠B-NonOSE_AE  with BRILINTA compared to clopidogrel.
 

 In PLATO, 1584 patients underwent CABG surgery. The percentages of those patients who  bled≠B-NonOSE_AE  are shown in Figure 2 and Table 2.



   Figure 2 - 'Major fatal/life-threatening' CABG-related bleeding by days from last dose of study drug to CABG procedure (PLATO)  



 X-axis is days from last dose of study drug prior to CABG.



 The PLATO protocol recommended a procedure for withholding study drug prior to CABG or other major surgery without unblinding. If surgery was elective or non-urgent, study drug was interrupted temporarily, as follows: If local practice was to allow antiplatelet effects to dissipate before surgery, capsules (blinded clopidogrel) were withheld 5 days before surgery and tablets (blinded ticagrelor) were withheld for a minimum of 24 hours and a maximum of 72 hours before surgery. If local practice was to perform surgery without waiting for dissipation of antiplatelet effects capsules and tablets were withheld 24 hours prior to surgery and use of aprotinin or other haemostatic agents was allowed. If local practice was to use IPA monitoring to determine when surgery could be performed both the capsules and tablets were withheld at the same time and the usual monitoring procedures followed.

 In a Holter substudy of about 3000 patients in PLATO, more patients had  ventricular≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pauses≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  with BRILINTA (6.0%) than with clopidogrel (3.5%) in the acute phase; rates were 2.2% and 1.6% respectively after 1 month. PLATO and PEGASUS excluded patients at increased risk of  bradycardic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  events (e.g., patients who have  sick≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   sinus≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   syndrome≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , 2  nd  or 3  rd  degree  AV≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   block≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , or  bradycardic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  related≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   syncope≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and not protected with a pacemaker). In PLATO,  syncope≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  pre≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  syncope≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  loss≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   consciousness≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  were reported by 1.7% and 1.5% of BRILINTA 90 mg and clopidogrel patients, respectively. In PEGASUS,  syncope≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was reported by 1.2% and 0.9% of patients on BRILINTA 60 mg and aspirin alone, respectively.



     Lab abnormalities    



 Serum Uric Acid:



 In PLATO,  serum≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   uric≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   acid≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   levels≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   increased≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  approximately 0.6 mg/dL from baseline on BRILINTA 90 mg and approximately 0.2 mg/dL on clopidogrel. The difference disappeared within 30 days of discontinuing treatment. Reports of  gout≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  did not differ between treatment groups in PLATO (0.6% in each group).



 In PEGASUS,  serum≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   uric≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   acid≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   levels≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   increased≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  approximately 0.2 mg/dL from baseline on BRILINTA 60 mg and no elevation was observed on aspirin alone.  Gout≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred more commonly in patients on BRILINTA than in patients on aspirin alone (1.5%,1.1%). Mean  serum≠B-NonOSE_AE   uric≠I-NonOSE_AE   acid≠I-NonOSE_AE  concentrations  decrease≠I-NonOSE_AE d after treatment was stopped.



 Serum Creatinine:



 In PLATO, a >50%  increase≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   serum≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   creatinine≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   levels≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  was observed in 7.4% of patients receiving BRILINTA 90 mg compared to 5.9% of patients receiving clopidogrel. The increases typically did not progress with ongoing treatment and often decreased with continued therapy. Evidence of reversibility upon discontinuation was observed even in those with the greatest on treatment increases. Treatment groups in PLATO did not differ for  renal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  related≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   serious≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   adverse≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   events≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  such as  acute≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   renal≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   failure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  chronic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   renal≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   failure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  toxic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   nephropathy≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , or  oliguria≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .



 In PEGASUS,  serum≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   creatinine≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  concentration increased by >50% in approximately 4% of patients receiving BRILINTA 60 mg, similar to aspirin alone. The frequency of  renal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   related≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   adverse≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   events≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  was similar for ticagrelor and aspirin alone regardless of age and baseline renal function.
