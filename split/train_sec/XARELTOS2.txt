  EXCERPT:   WARNING: (A) PREMATURE DISCONTINUATION OF XARELTO INCREASES THE RISK OF THROMBOTIC EVENTS, (B) SPINAL/EPIDURAL HEMATOMA

   See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning  

   (A)  Premature discontinuation of XARELTO increases the risk of thrombotic events  

   Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including XARELTO, increases the risk of thrombotic events. To reduce this risk, consider coverage with another anticoagulant if XARELTO is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy (  2.3  ,   2.8  ,   5.1  ,   14.1  ).  

   (B)  Spinal/epidural hematoma  

   Epidural or spinal hematomas have occurred in patients treated with XARELTO who are receiving neuraxial anesthesia or undergoing spinal puncture. These hematomas may result in long-term or permanent paralysis (  5.2  ,   5.3  ,   6.2  ).  

   Monitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment and if observed, treat urgently. Consider the benefits and risks before neuraxial intervention in patients who are or who need to be anticoagulated (  5.3  ).  

 

    A. Premature discontinuation of XARELTO increases the risk of  thrombotic≠B-NonOSE_AE   events≠I-NonOSE_AE   

   Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including XARELTO, increases the risk of  thrombotic≠B-NonOSE_AE   events≠I-NonOSE_AE . If anticoagulation with XARELTO is discontinued for a reason other than pathological  bleeding≠B-NonOSE_AE  or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant   [see   Dosage and Administration (2.3  ,   2.8)  ,   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  , and   Clinical Studies (14.1)  ]  .  

     B. Spinal/epidural hematoma  

    Epidural≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  or spinal  hematomas≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  have occurred in patients treated with XARELTO who are receiving neuraxial anesthesia or undergoing spinal puncture. These  hematomas≠B-NonOSE_AE  may result in long-term or permanent  paralysis≠B-NonOSE_AE . Consider these risks when scheduling patients for spinal procedures. Factors that can increase the risk of developing  epidural≠B-NonOSE_AE  or spinal  hematomas≠I-NonOSE_AE  in these patients include:  

 *  use of indwelling epidural catheters 
 *  concomitant use of other drugs that affect hemostasis, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), platelet inhibitors, other anticoagulants 
 *  a history of traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal punctures 
 *  a history of spinal deformity or spinal surgery 
 *  optimal timing between the administration of XARELTO and neuraxial procedures is not known 
      [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.2  ,   5.3)   and   Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ].  
 

   Monitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of  neurological≠B-NonOSE_AE   impairment≠I-NonOSE_AE . If  neurological≠B-NonOSE_AE   compromise≠I-NonOSE_AE  is noted, urgent treatment is necessary   [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  .  

   Consider the benefits and risks before neuraxial intervention in patients anticoagulated or to be anticoagulated for  thromboprophylaxis≠B-Not_AE_Candidate    [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  .
