    6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



    EXCERPT:    *    Adverse reactions occurring in >=2% of patients include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, decreased appetite, dizziness, abdominal pain, pruritus, somnolence, elevated transaminases, and elevated creatinine (  6.1  ).

  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

    Visceral Leishmaniasis  



 One Phase 3 trial was conducted in patients >= 12 years of age in India. Two-hundred and ninety-nine (299) patients (211 men and 88 women) received oral IMPAVIDO at a target dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day for 28 days (50 mg capsule once daily if weight was less than 25 kg and 50 mg capsule twice daily if weight was 25 kg or greater). Patients ranged between 12 and 64 years of age. Weight ranged between 15 and 67 kg (mean weight 38.6 kg) and BMI ranged between 8.2 and 24 (mean 16.1). Ninety-nine (99) patients received 1 mg/kg/day amphotericin B deoxycholate intravenously every other day for 15 doses. A statistically significant higher percentage of men received IMPAVIDO compared to amphotericin B.



  Less than 1% of patients who received IMPAVIDO  died≠B-NonOSE_AE  (2/299) and no patient who received amphotericin B  died≠B-NonOSE_AE . Serious adverse reactions were reported in 2% of IMPAVIDO recipients (6/299) and 1% of amphotericin B recipients (1/99). Approximately 3% of patients discontinued treatment in each treatment arm due to an adverse reaction. Serious adverse reactions and adverse reactions leading to drug discontinuation that were thought to be related or possibly related to IMPAVIDO included  Stevens≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  Johnson≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   syndrome≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  melena≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  thrombocytopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  arthritis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  skin≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   rash≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) Grade 4  diarrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (>=10 stools per day) and CTCAE Grade 4  hyperbilirubinemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (>=10x upper limit of normal ULN).

         In this study,  creatinine≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (Cr)  elevations≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  >= 1.5 times above baseline occurred in approximately 10% of IMPAVIDO recipients and in 40% of amphotericin B recipients at the end of therapy.

  Elevations≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  of  transaminases≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  during therapy occurred in up to half of IMPAVIDO recipients and up to a third of amphotericin B recipients.

   Cutaneous Leishmaniasis  



 The efficacy of IMPAVIDO in the treatment of  cutaneous≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   leishmaniasis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  was evaluated in one placebo-controlled trial conducted in Colombia and Guatemala and in two comparative trials conducted in Bolivia and Brazil respectively. In the placebo-controlled trial, eighty-nine (89) patients >=12 years of age received a target IMPAVIDO dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day for 28 days and forty-four (44) received placebo. In the comparative trials, one hundred and twenty (120) patients >=12 years of age received a target IMPAVIDO dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day for 28 days and fifty eight (58) patients received 20 mg/kg/day pentavalent antimony (meglumine) parenterally for 20 days.

  The following adverse reactions have been identified during use of IMPAVIDO worldwide. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
