  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed during the clinical trials performed with one somatropin formulation cannot always be directly compared to the rates observed during the clinical trials performed with a second somatropin formulation, and may not reflect the adverse reaction rates observed in practice.

     Clinical Trials in children with GHD  

 In clinical studies with GENOTROPIN in pediatric  GHD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  patients, the following events were reported infrequently:  injection≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   site≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , including  pain≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  or burning associated  with≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   the≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   injection≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , fibrosis, nodules, rash, inflammation, pigmentation, or bleeding;  lipoatrophy≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ;  headache≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ;  hematuria≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ;  hypothyroidism≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ; and mild  hyperglycemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .

     Clinical Trials in PWS  

 In two clinical studies with GENOTROPIN in pediatric patients with  Prader≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  Willi≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   syndrome≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , the following drug-related events were reported:  edema≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  aggressiveness≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  arthralgia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  benign≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   intracranial≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   hypertension≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  hair≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   loss≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  headache≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  myalgia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .

     Clinical Trials in children with SGA  

 In clinical studies of 273 pediatric patients born  small≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   for≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   gestational≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   age≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  treated with GENOTROPIN, the following clinically significant events were reported: mild transient  hyperglycemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , one patient with  benign≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   intracranial≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   hypertension≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , two patients with  central≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   precocious≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   puberty≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , two patients with  jaw≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   prominence≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and several patients with  aggravation≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   preexisting≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   scoliosis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  injection≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   site≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and self-limited  progression≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   pigmented≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   nevi≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE .  Anti≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  hGH≠I-NonOSE_AE   antibodies≠I-NonOSE_AE  were not detected in any of the patients treated with GENOTROPIN.

     Clinical Trials in children with Turner Syndrome  

 In two clinical studies with GENOTROPIN in pediatric patients with  Turner≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   syndrome≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , the most frequently reported adverse events were  respiratory≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   illnesses≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  ( influenza≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  tonsillitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  otitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  sinusitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ),  joint≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  urinary≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   tract≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infection≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . The only treatment-related adverse event that occurred in more than 1 patient was  joint≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE .

     Clinical Trials in children with Idiopathic Short Stature  

 In two open-label clinical studies with GENOTROPIN in pediatric patients with  ISS≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , the most commonly encountered adverse events include  upper≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   respiratory≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   tract≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   infections≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  influenza≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  tonsillitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  nasopharyngitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  gastroenteritis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  headaches≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  increased≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   appetite≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  pyrexia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  fracture≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  altered≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   mood≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  arthralgia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE . In one of the two studies, during GENOTROPIN treatment, the mean IGF-1 standard deviation (SD) scores were maintained in the normal range. IGF-1 SD scores above +2 SD were observed as follows: 1 subject (3%), 10 subjects (30%) and 16 subjects (38%) in the untreated control, 0. 23 and the 0.47 mg/kg/week groups, respectively, had at least one measurement; while 0 subjects (0%), 2 subjects (7%) and 6 subjects (14%) had two or more consecutive IGF-1 measurements above +2 SD.

     Clinical Trials in adults with GHD  

 In clinical trials with GENOTROPIN in 1,145  GHD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  adults, the majority of the adverse events consisted of mild to moderate symptoms of  fluid≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   retention≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , including  peripheral≠B-NonOSE_AE   swelling≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  arthralgia≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  pain≠B-NonOSE_AE  and  stiffness≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   the≠I-NonOSE_AE   extremities≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  peripheral≠B-NonOSE_AE   edema≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  myalgia≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  paresthesia≠B-NonOSE_AE , and  hypoesthesia≠B-NonOSE_AE . These events were reported early during therapy, and tended to be transient and/or responsive to dosage reduction.

 Table 1 displays the adverse events reported by 5% or more of adult  GHD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  patients in clinical trials after various durations of treatment with GENOTROPIN. Also presented are the corresponding incidence rates of these adverse events in placebo patients during the 6-month double-blind portion of the clinical trials.

                Post-Trial Extension Studies in Adults  
 

 In expanded post-trial extension studies,  diabetes≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   mellitus≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  developed in 12 of 3,031 patients (0.4%) during treatment with GENOTROPIN. All 12 patients had predisposing factors, e.g.,  elevated≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   glycated≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   hemoglobin≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   levels≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and/or marked  obesity≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , prior to receiving GENOTROPIN. Of the 3,031 patients receiving GENOTROPIN, 61 (2%) developed symptoms of  carpal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   tunnel≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   syndrome≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , which lessened after dosage reduction or treatment interruption (52) or surgery (9). Other adverse events that have been reported include  generalized≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   edema≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  hypoesthesia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE .

     Anti-hGH Antibodies  

 As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for  immunogenicity≠B-NonOSE_AE . The detection of  antibody≠B-NonOSE_AE   formation≠I-NonOSE_AE  is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of  antibody≠B-NonOSE_AE  (including neutralizing a ntibody≠B-NonOSE_AE  )≠I-NonOSE_AE    positivity≠I-NonOSE_AE  ≠≠I-NonOSE_AE I-NonOSE_AE  in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of  antibodies≠B-NonOSE_AE   to≠I-NonOSE_AE   GENOTROPIN≠I-NonOSE_AE  with the incidence of  antibodies≠B-NonOSE_AE   to≠I-NonOSE_AE   other≠I-NonOSE_AE   products≠I-NonOSE_AE  may be misleading. In the case of growth hormone,  antibodies≠B-NonOSE_AE  with binding capacities lower than 2 mg/mL have not been associated with  growth≠B-NonOSE_AE   attenuation≠I-NonOSE_AE . In a very small number of patients treated with somatropin, when binding capacity was greater than 2 mg/mL,  interference≠B-NonOSE_AE   with≠I-NonOSE_AE   the≠I-NonOSE_AE   growth≠I-NonOSE_AE   response≠I-NonOSE_AE  was observed.

 In 419 pediatric patients evaluated in clinical studies with GENOTROPIN lyophilized powder, 244 had been treated previously with GENOTROPIN or other growth hormone preparations and 175 had received no previous growth hormone therapy.  Antibodies≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   to≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   growth≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   hormone≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  ( anti≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  hGH≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   antibodies≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ) were present in six previously treated patients at baseline. Three of the six became  negative≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   for≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   anti≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  hGH≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   antibodies≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  during 6 to 12 months of treatment with GENOTROPIN. Of the remaining 413 patients, eight (1.9%) developed detectable  anti≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  hGH≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   antibodies≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  during treatment with GENOTROPIN; none had an  antibody≠B-NonOSE_AE  binding capacity > 2 mg/L. There was no evidence that the growth response to GENOTROPIN was affected in these  antibody≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  positive≠I-NonOSE_AE  patients.

     Periplasmic Escherichia coli Peptides  

 Preparations of GENOTROPIN contain a small amount of periplasmic  Escherichia coli  peptides (PECP).  Anti≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  PECP≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   antibodies≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  are found in a small number of patients treated with GENOTROPIN, but these appear to be of no clinical significance.

   6.2 Post-Marketing Experience

  Because these adverse events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

 Serious  systemic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   hypersensitivity≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  including  anaphylactic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  angioedema≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported with post-marketing use of somatropin products  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.6)  ].  

  Leukemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  has been reported in a small number of  GHD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  children treated with somatropin, somatrem (methionylated rhGH) and GH of pituitary origin. It is uncertain whether these cases of  leukemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  are related to GH therapy, the pathology of  GHD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  itself, or other associated treatments such as radiation therapy. On the basis of current evidence, experts have not been able to conclude that GH therapy  per se  was responsible for these cases of  leukemia≠B-NonOSE_AE . The risk for children with  GHD≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , if any, remains to be established  [see  Contraindications (4)  and  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ].  

 The following serious adverse reactions have been observed with use of somatropin (including events observed in patients who received brands of somatropin other than GENOTROPIN):  acute≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   critical≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   illness≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  ,  sudden≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   death≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]  ,  intracranial≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   tumors≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  ,  central≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   hypothyroidism≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.9)  ]  ,  cardiovascular≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   disorders≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  pancreatitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.15)  ]  .

  Slipped≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   capital≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   femoral≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   epiphysis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  Legg≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  Calve≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  Perthes≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   disease≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  ( osteonecrosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE / avascular≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   necrosis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ; occasionally associated with  slipped≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   capital≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   femoral≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   epiphysis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ) have been reported in children treated with growth hormone  [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.10)  ].  Cases have been reported with GENOTROPIN  .  

 The following additional adverse reactions have been observed during the appropriate use of somatropin:  headaches≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (children and adults),  gynecomastia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (children), and  significant≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   diabetic≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   retinopathy≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE .

 New-onset  type≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   2≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   diabetes≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   mellitus≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  has been reported.
