    6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

  The most commonly reported adverse reactions are  hypersensitivity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  (e.g.,  rash≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  urticaria≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ) reactions due to the effect of GH (e.g.,  arthralgia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  extremity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   pain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  peripheral≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   edema≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  hyperglycemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  carpal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   tunnel≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   syndrome≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ),  injection≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   site≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  ( injection≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   site≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   erythema≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , pruritus, pain, urticaria, irritation, swelling, hemorrhage).



 During the first 26 weeks of treatment (main phase), discontinuations as a result of adverse reactions occurred in 9.6% of patients receiving EGRIFTA  (r)  and 6.8% of patients receiving placebo. Apart from patients with  hypersensitivity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  identified during the studies and who were discontinued per protocol (2.2%), the most common reasons for discontinuation of EGRIFTA  (r)  treatment were adverse reactions due to the effect of GH (4.2%) and local  injection≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   site≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (4.6%).



 During the following 26 weeks of treatment (extension phase), discontinuations as a result of adverse events occurred in 2.4% of patients in the T-T group (patients treated with tesamorelin for Week 0-26 and with tesamorelin for Week 26-52) and 5.2% of patients in the T-P group (patients treated with tesamorelin for Week 0-26 and with placebo for Week 26-52).



   EXCERPT:   Most commonly reported adverse reactions (>5% and more frequent than placebo): Arthralgia, injection site erythema, injection site pruritus, pain in extremity, peripheral edema, and myalgia. (  6.1  )

  6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.



 Seven hundred and forty  HIV≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  infected≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   patients≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   with≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   lipodystrophy≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and  excess≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   abdominal≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   fat≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  were exposed to EGRIFTA  (r)  in the Phase 3 clinical trials; of these 543 received EGRIFTA  (r)  during the initial 26-week placebo-controlled phase  [see Clinical Studies (  14  )].  



 Adverse reactions that occurred more frequently with EGRIFTA  (r)  relative to placebo and had an incidence >=1% during the first 26 weeks across all studies are presented in  Table 1  .

         Mean levels of fasting blood glucose and fasting insulin were not significantly different between EGRIFTA  (r)  -treated and placebo-treated patients after 26 weeks of treatment.
 

 In the EGRIFTA  (r)  Phase 3 clinical trials, mean baseline (Week 0) HbA1cwas 5.26% among patients in the EGRIFTA  (r)  group and 5.28% among those in the placebo group. At Week 26, mean  HbA≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  1≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  cwas≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   higher≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  among patients treated with EGRIFTA  (r)  compared with placebo (5.39% vs. 5.28% for the EGRIFTA  (r)  and placebo groups, respectively, mean treatment difference of 0.12%, p=0.0004). Patients receiving EGRIFTA  (r)  had an increased risk of developing  diabetes≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  ( HbA≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  1≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  clevel≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   >≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  =≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   6≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  .≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  5≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  %≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ) compared with placebo (4.5% vs. 1.3%), with a hazard ratio of 3.3 (CI 1.4, 9.6).



 Adverse reactions observed during Week 26 to 52 of the Phase 3 clinical trials which had an incidence of >=1% and were seen more frequently with EGRIFTA  (r)  relative to placebo are presented in  Table 2  :

           6.2 Immunogenicity

In the combined Phase 3 clinical trials  anti≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  tesamorelin≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   IgG≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   antibodies≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  were detected in 49.5% of patients treated with EGRIFTA  (r)  for 26 weeks and 47.4% of patients who received EGRIFTA  (r)  for 52 weeks. In the subset of patients with  hypersensitivity≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  anti≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  tesamorelin≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   IgG≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   antibodies≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   were≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   detected≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  in 85.2%.

Patients with and without  anti≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  tesamorelin≠I-NonOSE_AE   IgG≠I-NonOSE_AE   antibodies≠I-NonOSE_AE  had similar mean  reductions≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   visceral≠I-NonOSE_AE   adipose≠I-NonOSE_AE   tissue≠I-NonOSE_AE   (≠I-NonOSE_AE  VAT≠I-NonOSE_AE ) and  IGF≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  1≠I-NonOSE_AE   response≠I-NonOSE_AE  suggesting that the  presence≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   antibodies≠I-NonOSE_AE  did not alter the efficacy of EGRIFTA  (r)  . In a group of patients who had  antibodies≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   to≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   tesamorelin≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  after 26 weeks of treatment (56%) and were re-assessed 6 months later, after stopping EGRIFTA  (r)  treatment, 18% were still  antibody≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   positive≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE .



  Neutralizing≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   antibodies≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   to≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   tesamorelin≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and hGHRH were detected in vitro at Week 52 in 10% and 5% of EGRIFTA  (r)  -treated patients, respectively. They did not appear to have an impact on efficacy, as evidenced by comparable changes in VAT and IGF-1 level in patients with or without in vitro  neutralizing≠B-NonOSE_AE   antibodies≠I-NonOSE_AE .



 The observed incidence of  antibody≠B-NonOSE_AE   positivity≠I-NonOSE_AE  in an assay is highly dependent on several factors including assay sensitivity and specificity, methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medication and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of  antibodies≠B-NonOSE_AE   to≠I-NonOSE_AE   EGRIFTA≠I-NonOSE_AE   (r)  with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.
