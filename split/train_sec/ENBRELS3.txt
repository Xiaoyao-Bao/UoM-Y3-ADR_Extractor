    5        WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS      

   EXCERPT:    *  Do not start Enbrel during an active infection. If an infection develops, monitor carefully and stop Enbrel if infection becomes serious. (  5.1  ) 
 *  Consider empiric anti-fungal therapy for patients at risk for invasive fungal infections who develop a severe systemic illness on Enbrel (those who reside or travel to regions where mycoses are endemic). (  5.1  ) 
 *  Demyelinating disease, exacerbation or new onset, may occur. (  5.2  ) 
 *  Cases of lymphoma have been observed in patients receiving TNF-blocking agents. (  5.3  ) 
 *  Congestive heart failure, worsening or new onset, may occur. (  5.4  ) 
 *  Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms of pancytopenia or aplastic anemia develop, and consider stopping Enbrel. (  5.5  ) 
 *  Monitor patients previously infected with hepatitis B virus for reactivation during and several months after therapy. If reactivation occurs, consider stopping Enbrel and beginning anti-viral therapy. (  5.6  ) 
 *  Anaphylaxis or serious allergic reactions may occur. (  5.7  ) 
 *  Stop Enbrel if lupus-like syndrome or autoimmune hepatitis develops. (  5.9  ) 
    
 

   5.1       Serious Infections

  Patients treated with Enbrel are at increased risk for developing serious  infections≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  involving various organ systems and sites that may lead to hospitalization or  death≠B-NonOSE_AE .

  Opportunistic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   infections≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, parasitic, or other opportunistic pathogens including  aspergillosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  blastomycosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  candidiasis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  coccidioidomycosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  histoplasmosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  legionellosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  listeriosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  pneumocystosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  tuberculosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported with TNF blockers. Patients have frequently presented with disseminated rather than localized disease.

 Treatment with Enbrel should not be initiated in patients with an active  infection≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , including clinically important  localized≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   infections≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Patients greater than 65 years of age, patients with co-morbid conditions, and/or patients taking concomitant  immunosuppressants≠B-NonOSE_AE  (such as corticosteroids or methotrexate), may be at greater risk of  infection≠B-NonOSE_AE . The risks and benefits of treatment should be considered prior to initiating therapy in patients:

 *  With chronic or recurrent  infection≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ; 
 *  Who have been exposed to  tuberculosis≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ; 
 *  With a history of an  opportunistic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   infection≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ; 
 *  Who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic  tuberculosis≠B-NonOSE_AE  or endemic  mycoses≠B-NonOSE_AE , such as  histoplasmosis≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  coccidioidomycosis≠B-NonOSE_AE , or  blastomycosis≠B-NonOSE_AE ; or 
 *  With underlying conditions that may  predispose≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   them≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   to≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   infection≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , such as advanced or poorly controlled  diabetes≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  [see Adverse Reactions (    6.1    )] . 
    Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of  infection≠B-NonOSE_AE  during and after treatment with Enbrel.
 

 Enbrel should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious  infection≠B-NonOSE_AE  or  sepsis≠B-NonOSE_AE . A patient who develops a new  infection≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  during treatment with Enbrel should be closely monitored, undergo a prompt and complete diagnostic workup appropriate for an  immunocompromised≠B-NonOSE_AE  patient, and appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be initiated.

  Tuberculosis  

 Cases of  reactivation≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   tuberculosis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  or new  tuberculosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   infections≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been observed in patients receiving Enbrel, including patients who have previously received treatment for  latent≠B-NonOSE_AE  or active  tuberculosis≠I-NonOSE_AE . Data from clinical trials and preclinical studies suggest that the risk of  reactivation≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   latent≠I-NonOSE_AE   tuberculosis≠I-NonOSE_AE   infection≠I-NonOSE_AE  is lower with Enbrel than with TNF-blocking monoclonal antibodies. Nonetheless, postmarketing cases of  tuberculosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactivation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported for TNF blockers, including Enbrel.   Tuberculosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  has developed in patients who tested  negative≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   for≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   latent≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   tuberculosis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  prior to initiation of therapy. Patients should be evaluated for  tuberculosis≠B-NonOSE_AE  risk factors and tested for  latent≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   infection≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  prior to initiating Enbrel and periodically during therapy.   Tests≠B-NonOSE_AE   for≠I-NonOSE_AE   latent≠I-NonOSE_AE   tuberculosis≠I-NonOSE_AE   infection≠I-NonOSE_AE   may≠I-NonOSE_AE   be≠I-NonOSE_AE   falsely≠I-NonOSE_AE   negative≠I-NonOSE_AE  while on therapy with Enbrel.

 Treatment of  latent≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   tuberculosis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   infection≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  prior to therapy with TNF-blocking agents has been shown to reduce the risk of  tuberculosis≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactivation≠I-NonOSE_AE  during therapy.  Induration≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   5≠I-NonOSE_AE   mm≠I-NonOSE_AE   or≠I-NonOSE_AE   greater≠I-NonOSE_AE   with≠I-NonOSE_AE   tuberculin≠I-NonOSE_AE   skin≠I-NonOSE_AE   testing≠I-NonOSE_AE   should≠I-NonOSE_AE   be≠I-NonOSE_AE   considered≠I-NonOSE_AE   a≠I-NonOSE_AE   positive≠I-NonOSE_AE   test≠I-NonOSE_AE  result when assessing if treatment for  latent≠B-NonOSE_AE   tuberculosis≠I-NonOSE_AE  is needed prior to initiating Enbrel, even for patients previously vaccinated with  Bacille≠B-NonOSE_AE   Calmette≠I-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  Guerin≠I-NonOSE_AE   (≠I-NonOSE_AE  BCG≠I-NonOSE_AE ).

  Anti≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  tuberculosis≠I-NonOSE_AE   therapy≠I-NonOSE_AE  should also be considered prior to initiation of Enbrel in patients with a past history of  latent≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or active  tuberculosis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a  negative≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   test≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   for≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   latent≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   tuberculosis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  but having risk factors for  tuberculosis≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   infection≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of  tuberculosis≠B-NonOSE_AE  is recommended to aid in the decision whether initiating  anti≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  tuberculosis≠I-NonOSE_AE   therapy≠I-NonOSE_AE  is appropriate for an individual patient.

  Tuberculosis≠B-NonOSE_AE  should be strongly considered in patients who develop a new  infection≠B-NonOSE_AE  during Enbrel treatment, especially in patients who have previously or recently traveled to countries with a high prevalence of  tuberculosis≠B-NonOSE_AE , or who have had close contact with a person with  active≠B-NonOSE_AE   tuberculosis≠I-NonOSE_AE .

  Invasive Fungal Infections  

 Cases of serious and sometimes  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE   fungal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   infections≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , including  histoplasmosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , have been reported with TNF blockers, including Enbrel. For patients who reside or travel in regions where  mycoses≠B-NonOSE_AE  are endemic,  invasive≠B-NonOSE_AE   fungal≠I-NonOSE_AE   infection≠I-NonOSE_AE  should be suspected if they develop a serious  systemic≠B-NonOSE_AE   illness≠I-NonOSE_AE . Appropriate empiric anti-fungal therapy should be considered while a diagnostic workup is being performed.  Antigen≠B-NonOSE_AE  and antibody  testing≠I-NonOSE_AE   for≠I-NonOSE_AE   histoplasmosis≠I-NonOSE_AE   may≠I-NonOSE_AE   be≠I-NonOSE_AE   negative≠I-NonOSE_AE  in some patients with active  infection≠B-NonOSE_AE . When feasible, the decision to administer empiric anti-fungal therapy in these patients should be made in consultation with a physician with expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of invasive  fungal≠B-NonOSE_AE   infections≠I-NonOSE_AE  and should take into account both the risk for severe  fungal≠B-NonOSE_AE   infection≠I-NonOSE_AE  and the risks of anti-fungal therapy. In 38 Enbrel clinical trials and 4 cohort studies in all approved indications representing 27,169 patient-years of exposure (17,696 patients) from the United States and Canada, no  histoplasmosis≠B-NonOSE_AE   infections≠I-NonOSE_AE  were reported among patients treated with Enbrel.

    5.2        Neurologic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   Reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE 

  Treatment with TNF-blocking agents, including Enbrel, has been associated with rare (< 0.1%) cases of new onset or exacerbation of  central≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   nervous≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   system≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   demyelinating≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   disorders≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , some presenting with  mental≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   status≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   changes≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and some associated with permanent disability, and with  peripheral≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   nervous≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   system≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   demyelinating≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   disorders≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . Cases of  transverse≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   myelitis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  optic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   neuritis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  multiple≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   sclerosis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  Guillain≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  Barre≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   syndromes≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , other  peripheral≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   demyelinating≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   neuropathies≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , and new onset or exacerbation of  seizure≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   disorders≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported in postmarketing experience with Enbrel therapy. Prescribers should exercise caution in considering the use of Enbrel in patients with preexisting or recent-onset central or peripheral nervous system  demyelinating≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorders≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  [   see   Adverse Reactions   (     6.2     )]  .

    5.3       Malignancies

   Lymphomas  

 In the controlled portions of clinical trials of TNF-blocking agents, more cases of  lymphoma≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been observed among patients receiving a TNF blocker compared to control patients. During the controlled portions of Enbrel trials in adult patients with  RA≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ,  AS≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , and  PsA≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , 2  lymphomas≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  were observed among 3306 Enbrel-treated patients versus 0 among 1521 control patients (duration of controlled treatment ranged from 3 to 36 months).

 Among 6543 adult rheumatology ( RA≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ,  PsA≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ,  AS≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ) patients treated with Enbrel in controlled and uncontrolled portions of clinical trials, representing approximately 12,845 patient-years of therapy, the observed rate of  lymphoma≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was 0.10 cases per 100 patient-years. This was 3-fold higher than the rate of  lymphoma≠B-NonOSE_AE  expected in the general U.S. population based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Database.  An increased rate of  lymphoma≠B-NonOSE_AE  up to several-fold has been reported in the  RA≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  patient population, and may be further increased in patients with more severe disease activity.

 Among 4410 adult  PsO≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  patients treated with Enbrel in clinical trials up to 36 months, representing approximately 4278 patient-years of therapy, the observed rate of  lymphoma≠B-NonOSE_AE  was 0.05 cases per 100 patient-years, which is comparable to the rate in the general population. No cases were observed in Enbrel- or placebo-treated patients during the controlled portions of these trials.

  Leukemia  

 Cases of  acute≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and chronic  leukemia≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported in association with postmarketing TNF-blocker use in  rheumatoid≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   arthritis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  and other indications. Even in the absence of TNF-blocker therapy, patients with  rheumatoid≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   arthritis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  may be at higher risk (approximately 2-fold) than the general population for the development of  leukemia≠B-NonOSE_AE .

 During the controlled portions of Enbrel trials, 2 cases of  leukemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  were observed among 5445 (0.06 cases per 100 patient-years) Enbrel-treated patients versus 0 among 2890 (0%) control patients (duration of controlled treatment ranged from 3 to 48 months).

 Among 15,401 patients treated with Enbrel in controlled and open portions of clinical trials representing approximately 23,325 patient-years of therapy, the observed rate of  leukemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was 0.03 cases per 100 patient-years.

  Other Malignancies  

 Information is available from 10,953 adult patients with 17,123 patient-years and 696 pediatric patients with 1282 patient-years of experience across 45 Enbrel clinical studies.

 For  malignancies≠B-NonOSE_AE  other than  lymphoma≠B-NonOSE_AE  and  non≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  melanoma≠I-NonOSE_AE   skin≠I-NonOSE_AE   cancer≠I-NonOSE_AE , there was no difference in exposure-adjusted rates between the Enbrel and control arms in the controlled portions of clinical studies for all indications. Analysis of the  malignancy≠B-NonOSE_AE  rate in combined controlled and uncontrolled portions of studies has demonstrated that types and rates are similar to what is expected in the general U.S. population based on the SEER database and suggests no increase in rates over time.  Whether treatment with Enbrel might influence the development and course of  malignancies≠B-NonOSE_AE  in adults is unknown.

  Melanoma and   Non  - M   elanoma   S   kin   C   ancer (NMSC)  

  Melanoma≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  non≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  melanoma≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   skin≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   cancer≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  has been reported in patients treated with TNF antagonists including etanercept.

 Among 15,401 patients treated with Enbrel in controlled and open portions of clinical trials representing approximately 23,325 patient-years of therapy, the observed rate of  melanoma≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was 0.043 cases per 100 patient-years.

 Among 3306 adult rheumatology ( RA≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ,  PsA≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ,  AS≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ) patients treated with Enbrel in controlled clinical trials representing approximately 2669 patient-years of therapy, the observed rate of  NMSC≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was 0.41 cases per 100 patient-years vs 0.37 cases per 100 patient-years among 1521 control-treated patients representing 1077 patient-years.  Among 1245 adult  PsO≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  patients treated with Enbrel in controlled clinical trials, representing approximately 283 patient-years of therapy, the observed rate of  NMSC≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was 3.54 cases per 100 patient-years vs 1.28 cases per 100 patient-years among 720 control-treated patients representing 156 patient-years.

 Postmarketing cases of  Merkel≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   cell≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   carcinoma≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported very infrequently in patients treated with Enbrel.

 Periodic skin examinations should be considered for all patients at increased risk for  skin≠B-NonOSE_AE   cancer≠I-NonOSE_AE .

  Pediatric Patients  

  Malignancies≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , some  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE , have been reported among children, adolescents, and young adults who received treatment with TNF-blocking agents (initiation of therapy at <= 18 years of age), including Enbrel. Approximately half the cases were  lymphomas≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , including  Hodgkin≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  '≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  s≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and non-Hodgkin's  lymphoma≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . The other cases represented a variety of different  malignancies≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and included rare  malignancies≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  usually associated with  immunosuppression≠B-NonOSE_AE  and  malignancies≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  that are not usually observed in children and adolescents. The  malignancies≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred after a median of 30 months of therapy (range 1 to 84 months). Most of the patients were receiving concomitant  immunosuppressants≠B-NonOSE_AE . These cases were reported postmarketing and are derived from a variety of sources, including registries and spontaneous postmarketing reports.

 In clinical trials of 1140 pediatric patients representing 1927.2 patient-years of therapy, no  malignancies≠B-NonOSE_AE , including  lymphoma≠B-NonOSE_AE  or  NMSC≠B-NonOSE_AE , have been reported.

  Post   m   arketing Use  

 In global postmarketing adult and pediatric use,  lymphoma≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and other  malignancies≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported.

    5.4       Patients With Heart Failure

  Two clinical trials evaluating the use of Enbrel in the treatment of  heart≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   failure≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  were terminated early due to lack of efficacy. One of these studies suggested higher  mortality≠B-NonOSE_AE  in Enbrel-treated patients compared to placebo [see   Adverse React   ion   s       (     6.2     )]  .     There have been postmarketing reports of  worsening≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   congestive≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   heart≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   failure≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  CHF≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ), with and without identifiable precipitating factors, in patients taking Enbrel. There have also been rare (< 0.1%) reports of  new≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   onset≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   CHF≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , including  CHF≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  in patients without known preexisting  cardiovascular≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Some of these patients have been under 50 years of age. Physicians should exercise caution when using Enbrel in patients who also have  heart≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   failure≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , and monitor patients carefully.

    5.5        Hematologic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   Reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE 

  Rare (< 0.1%) reports of  pancytopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , including very rare (< 0.01%) reports of  aplastic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   anemia≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , some with a  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE  outcome, have been reported in patients treated with Enbrel. The causal relationship to Enbrel therapy remains unclear. Although no high-risk group has been identified, caution should be exercised in patients being treated with Enbrel who have a previous history of significant  hematologic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   abnormalities≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . All patients should be advised to seek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of  blood≠B-NonOSE_AE   dyscrasias≠I-NonOSE_AE  or  infection≠B-NonOSE_AE  (eg,  persistent≠B-NonOSE_AE   fever≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  bruising≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  bleeding≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  pallor≠B-NonOSE_AE ) while on Enbrel. Discontinuation of Enbrel therapy should be considered in patients with confirmed significant  hematologic≠B-NonOSE_AE   abnormalities≠I-NonOSE_AE .

 Two percent of patients treated concurrently with Enbrel and anakinra developed  neutropenia≠B-NonOSE_AE  ( ANC≠B-NonOSE_AE   <≠I-NonOSE_AE   1≠I-NonOSE_AE   x≠I-NonOSE_AE   1≠I-NonOSE_AE  0≠I-NonOSE_AE    9≠I-NonOSE_AE    /≠I-NonOSE_AE  L≠I-NonOSE_AE ). While  neutropenic≠B-NonOSE_AE , one patient developed  cellulitis≠B-NonOSE_AE  that resolved with antibiotic therapy.

    5.6       Hepatitis B Reactivation

   Reactivation≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   hepatitis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   B≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  in patients who were previously  infected≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   with≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   the≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   hepatitis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   B≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   virus≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   (≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  HBV≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ) and had received concomitant TNF-blocking agents, including very rare cases (< 0.01%) with Enbrel, has been reported. In some instances,  hepatitis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   B≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactivation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurring in conjunction with TNF-blocker therapy has been  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE . The majority of these reports have occurred in patients concomitantly receiving other  medications≠B-NonOSE_AE   that≠I-NonOSE_AE   suppress≠I-NonOSE_AE   the≠I-NonOSE_AE   immune≠I-NonOSE_AE   system≠I-NonOSE_AE , which may also contribute to  hepatitis≠B-NonOSE_AE   B≠I-NonOSE_AE   reactivation≠I-NonOSE_AE . Patients at risk for  HBV≠B-NonOSE_AE   infection≠I-NonOSE_AE  should be evaluated for prior evidence of  HBV≠B-NonOSE_AE   infection≠I-NonOSE_AE  before initiating TNF-blocker therapy. Prescribers should exercise caution in prescribing TNF blockers in patients previously infected with  HBV≠B-Not_AE_Candidate . Adequate data are not available on the safety or efficacy of treating patients who are carriers of  HBV≠B-NonOSE_AE  with anti-viral therapy in conjunction with TNF-blocker therapy to prevent  HBV≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactivation≠I-NonOSE_AE . Patients previously infected with  HBV≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and requiring treatment with Enbrel should be closely monitored for clinical and laboratory signs of  active≠B-NonOSE_AE   HBV≠I-NonOSE_AE   infection≠I-NonOSE_AE  throughout therapy and for several months following termination of therapy. In patients who develop  HBV≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactivation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , consideration should be given to stopping Enbrel and initiating anti-viral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment. The safety of resuming Enbrel therapy after  HBV≠B-NonOSE_AE   reactivation≠I-NonOSE_AE  is controlled is not known. Therefore, prescribers should weigh the risks and benefits when considering resumption of therapy in this situation.

    5.7       Allergic Reactions  

   Allergic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  associated with administration of Enbrel during clinical trials have been reported in < 2% of patients. If an  anaphylactic≠B-NonOSE_AE   reaction≠I-NonOSE_AE  or other serious  allergic≠B-NonOSE_AE   reaction≠I-NonOSE_AE  occurs, administration of Enbrel should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated.

 Caution:  The following components contain dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which may cause  allergic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   reactions≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  in individuals sensitive to  latex≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE : the needle cover of the prefilled syringe, the needle cover within the white cap of the SureClick autoinjector, and the needle cover within the purple cap of the Enbrel Mini cartridge.

    5.8       Immunizations

  Live vaccines should not be given concurrently with Enbrel.  It is recommended that pediatric patients, if possible, be brought up-to-date with all immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating Enbrel therapy [   see       Drug Interactions (     7.1     )       and   Use in   Specific Populations (     8.4     )   ]  .

    5.9       Autoimmunity

  Treatment with Enbrel may result in the  formation≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   autoantibodies≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  [see Adverse Reactions (     6.1     )]  and, rarely (< 0.1%), in the development of a  lupus≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  like≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   syndrome≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  or  autoimmune≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   hepatitis≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  [see Adverse Reactions (     6.2     )]  , which may resolve following withdrawal of Enbrel. If a patient develops symptoms and findings suggestive of a  lupus≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  like≠I-NonOSE_AE   syndrome≠I-NonOSE_AE  or  autoimmune≠B-NonOSE_AE   hepatitis≠I-NonOSE_AE  following treatment with Enbrel, treatment should be discontinued and the patient should be carefully evaluated.

    5.10       Immunosuppression

  TNF mediates  inflammation≠B-NonOSE_AE  and  modulates≠B-NonOSE_AE   cellular≠I-NonOSE_AE   immune≠I-NonOSE_AE  responses. TNF-blocking agents, including Enbrel, affect host defenses against  infections≠B-NonOSE_AE .  The effect of TNF inhibition on the development and course of  malignancies≠B-NonOSE_AE  is not fully understood.  In a study of 49 patients with  RA≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  treated with Enbrel, there was no evidence of  depression≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   delayed≠I-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  type≠I-NonOSE_AE   hypersensitivity≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  depression≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   immunoglobulin≠I-NonOSE_AE   levels≠I-NonOSE_AE , or  change≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   enumeration≠I-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   effector≠I-NonOSE_AE   cell≠I-NonOSE_AE   populations≠I-NonOSE_AE   [   see   Warnings   and Precautions   (     5.1     ,     5.3     )       and   Adverse Reactions   (     6.1     )   ]  .

    5.11       Use in Wegener's Granulomatosis Patients

  The use of Enbrel in patients with  Wegener≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  s≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   granulomatosis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  receiving  immunosuppressive≠B-NonOSE_AE   agents≠I-NonOSE_AE  is not recommended. In a study of patients with  Wegener≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  s≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   granulomatosis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , the addition of Enbrel to standard therapy (including cyclophosphamide) was associated with a higher incidence of  non≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  cutaneous≠I-NonOSE_AE   solid≠I-NonOSE_AE   malignancies≠I-NonOSE_AE  and was not associated with improved clinical outcomes when compared with standard therapy alone [see   Drug Interactions (     7.3     )   ]  .
