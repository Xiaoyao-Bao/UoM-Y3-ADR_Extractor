   5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

   EXCERPT:    *  Cerebrovascular events, including stroke, in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis: RISPERDAL  (r)  is not approved for use in patients with dementia-related psychosis. (  5.2  ) 
 *  Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome: Manage with immediate discontinuation of RISPERDAL  (r)  and close monitoring. (  5.3  ) 
 *  Tardive dyskinesia: Consider discontinuing RISPERDAL  (r)  if clinically indicated. (  5.4  ) 
 *  *   Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus: Monitor patients for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Monitor glucose regularly in patients with diabetes or at risk for diabetes. (  5.5  ) 
 *   Dyslipidemia: Undesirable alterations have been observed in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. (  5.5  ) 
 *   Weight Gain: Significant weight gain has been reported. Monitor weight gain. (  5.5  ) 
   Metabolic Changes: Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular/ cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and weight gain. (  5.5  ) 
 *  Hyperprolactinemia: Prolactin elevations occur and persist during chronic administration. (  5.6  ) 
 *  Orthostatic hypotension: For patients at risk, consider a lower starting dose and slower titration. (  5.7  ) 
 *  Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis: Perform complete blood counts in patients with a history of clinically significant low white blood cell count (WBC). Consider discontinuing RISPERDAL  (r)  if a clinically significant decline in WBC occurs in the absence of other causative factors. (  5.9  ) 
 *  Potential for cognitive and motor impairment: Use caution when operating machinery. (  5.10  ) 
 *  Seizures: Use cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that lower the seizure threshold. (  5.11  ) 
    
 

   5.1 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis

  Elderly patients with  dementia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  related≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   psychosis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of  death≠B-NonOSE_AE . Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of  death≠B-NonOSE_AE  in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of  death≠B-NonOSE_AE  in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of  death≠B-NonOSE_AE  in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of  death≠B-NonOSE_AE  were varied, most of the  deaths≠B-NonOSE_AE  appeared to be either  cardiovascular≠I-NonOSE_AE  (e.g.,  heart≠B-NonOSE_AE   failure≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  sudden≠B-NonOSE_AE   death≠I-NonOSE_AE ) or  infectious≠B-NonOSE_AE  (e.g.,  pneumonia≠B-NonOSE_AE ) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase  mortality≠B-NonOSE_AE . The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear.

 In two of four placebo-controlled trials in  elderly≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  patients with  dementia≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  related≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   psychosis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , a higher incidence of mortality was observed in patients treated with furosemide plus RISPERDAL  (r)  when compared to patients treated with RISPERDAL  (r)  alone or with placebo plus furosemide. No pathological mechanism has been identified to explain this finding, and no consistent pattern for cause of  death≠B-NonOSE_AE  was observed.

 RISPERDAL  (r)  (risperidone) is not approved for the treatment of  dementia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  related≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   psychosis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  [see  Boxed Warning  ]  .

    5.2 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions, Including Stroke, in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis

   Cerebrovascular≠B-NonOSE_AE   adverse≠I-NonOSE_AE   reactions≠I-NonOSE_AE  (e.g.,  stroke≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  transient≠B-NonOSE_AE   ischemic≠I-NonOSE_AE   attack≠I-NonOSE_AE ), including  fatalities≠B-NonOSE_AE , were reported in patients (mean age 85 years; range 73-97) in trials of risperidone in elderly patients with  dementia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  related≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   psychosis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . In placebo-controlled trials, there was a significantly higher incidence of  cerebrovascular≠B-NonOSE_AE   adverse≠I-NonOSE_AE   events≠I-NonOSE_AE  in patients treated with risperidone compared to patients treated with placebo. RISPERDAL  (r)  is not approved for the treatment of patients with  dementia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  related≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   psychosis≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . [see     Boxed Warning     and     Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  

    5.3 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome

  Antipsychotic drugs including RISPERDAL  (r)  can cause a potentially  fatal≠B-NonOSE_AE  symptom complex referred to as  Neuroleptic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   Malignant≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   Syndrome≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   (≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  NMS≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ). Clinical manifestations of  NMS≠B-NonOSE_AE  include  hyperpyrexia≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  muscle≠B-NonOSE_AE   rigidity≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  altered≠B-NonOSE_AE   mental≠I-NonOSE_AE   status≠I-NonOSE_AE , and  autonomic≠B-NonOSE_AE   instability≠I-NonOSE_AE  ( irregular≠B-NonOSE_AE   pulse≠I-NonOSE_AE  or blood pressure,  tachycardia≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  diaphoresis≠B-NonOSE_AE , and  cardiac≠B-NonOSE_AE   dysrhythmia≠I-NonOSE_AE ). Additional signs may include  elevated≠B-NonOSE_AE   creatine≠I-NonOSE_AE   phosphokinase≠I-NonOSE_AE   (≠I-NonOSE_AE  CPK≠I-NonOSE_AE ),  myoglobinuria≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  rhabdomyolysis≠B-NonOSE_AE , and  acute≠B-NonOSE_AE   renal≠I-NonOSE_AE   failure≠I-NonOSE_AE .

 The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases in which the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g.,  pneumonia≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  systemic≠B-NonOSE_AE   infection≠I-NonOSE_AE , etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated  extrapyramidal≠B-NonOSE_AE   signs≠I-NonOSE_AE   and≠I-NonOSE_AE   symptoms≠I-NonOSE_AE   (≠I-NonOSE_AE  EPS≠I-NonOSE_AE ). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include  central≠B-NonOSE_AE   anticholinergic≠I-NonOSE_AE   toxicity≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  heat≠B-NonOSE_AE   stroke≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  drug≠B-NonOSE_AE   fever≠I-NonOSE_AE , and  primary≠B-NonOSE_AE   central≠I-NonOSE_AE   nervous≠I-NonOSE_AE   system≠I-NonOSE_AE   pathology≠I-NonOSE_AE .

 The management of  NMS≠B-NonOSE_AE  should include: (1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy; (2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring; and (3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for uncomplicated  NMS≠B-NonOSE_AE .

 If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from  NMS≠B-NonOSE_AE , the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of  NMS≠B-NonOSE_AE  have been reported.

    5.4  Tardive≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   Dyskinesia≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE 

  A syndrome of potentially irreversible, involuntary,  dyskinetic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   movements≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. The risk of developing  tardive≠B-NonOSE_AE   dyskinesia≠I-NonOSE_AE  and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses.

 There is no known treatment for established cases of  tardive≠B-NonOSE_AE   dyskinesia≠I-NonOSE_AE , although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.

 Given these considerations, prescribe RISPERDAL  (r)  in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of  tardive≠B-NonOSE_AE   dyskinesia≠I-NonOSE_AE . Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that: (1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.

 If signs and symptoms of  tardive≠B-NonOSE_AE   dyskinesia≠I-NonOSE_AE  appear in a patient treated with RISPERDAL  (r)  , consider drug discontinuation. However, some patients may require treatment with RISPERDAL  (r)  despite the presence of the syndrome.

    5.5 Metabolic Changes

  Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with  metabolic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   changes≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  that may increase cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk. These  metabolic≠B-NonOSE_AE   changes≠I-NonOSE_AE  include  hyperglycemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  dyslipidemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  body≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   weight≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   gain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE . While all of the drugs in the class have been shown to produce some  metabolic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   changes≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , each drug has its own specific risk profile.

    Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus  

  Hyperglycemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  diabetes≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   mellitus≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , in some cases extreme and associated with  ketoacidosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  or  hyperosmolar≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   coma≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  or  death≠B-NonOSE_AE , have been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics including RISPERDAL  (r)  . Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and  glucose≠B-NonOSE_AE   abnormalities≠I-NonOSE_AE  is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of  diabetes≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   mellitus≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  in patients with  schizophrenia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and the increasing incidence of  diabetes≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   mellitus≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and  hyperglycemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  related≠I-NonOSE_AE   adverse≠I-NonOSE_AE   events≠I-NonOSE_AE  is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent  hyperglycemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  -≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  related≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   adverse≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   events≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for  hyperglycemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  related≠I-NonOSE_AE   adverse≠I-NonOSE_AE   events≠I-NonOSE_AE  in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available.

 Patients with an established diagnosis of  diabetes≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   mellitus≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  who are started on atypical antipsychotics, including RISPERDAL  (r)  , should be monitored regularly for  worsening≠B-NonOSE_AE   of≠I-NonOSE_AE   glucose≠I-NonOSE_AE   control≠I-NonOSE_AE . Patients with risk factors for  diabetes≠B-NonOSE_AE   mellitus≠I-NonOSE_AE  (e.g.,  obesity≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ,  family≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   history≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   of≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   diabetes≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics, including RISPERDAL  (r)  , should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics, including RISPERDAL  (r)  , should be monitored for symptoms of  hyperglycemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  including  polydipsia≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  polyuria≠B-NonOSE_AE ,  polyphagia≠B-NonOSE_AE , and  weakness≠B-NonOSE_AE . Patients who develop symptoms of  hyperglycemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  during treatment with atypical antipsychotics, including RISPERDAL  (r)  , should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases,  hyperglycemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic, including RISPERDAL  (r)  , was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of RISPERDAL  (r)  .

 Pooled data from three double-blind, placebo-controlled  schizophrenia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  studies and four double-blind, placebo-controlled  bipolar≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  monotherapy studies are presented in Table 2.

    Weight Gain  

  Weight≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   gain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  has been observed with atypical antipsychotic use. Clinical monitoring of weight is recommended.

         In longer-term, uncontrolled, open-label extension pediatric studies, RISPERDAL  (r)  was associated with a  mean≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   change≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   weight≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  of +5.5 kg at Week 24 (n=748) and +8.0 kg at Week 48 (n=242).
 

 In a long-term, open-label extension study in adolescent patients with  schizophrenia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ,  weight≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   increase≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  was reported as a treatment-emergent adverse event in 14% of patients. In 103 adolescent patients with  schizophrenia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate , a  mean≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   increase≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   9≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  .≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  0≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   kg≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  was observed after 8 months of RISPERDAL  (r)  treatment. The majority of that increase was observed within the first 6 months. The average percentiles at baseline and 8 months, respectively, were 56 and 72 for weight, 55 and 58 for height, and 51 and 71 for body mass index.

 In long-term, open-label trials (studies in patients with  autistic≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  or other  psychiatric≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disorders≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ), a  mean≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   increase≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   7≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  .≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  5≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   kg≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  after 12 months of RISPERDAL  (r)  treatment was observed, which was higher than the expected normal  weight≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   gain≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  (approximately 3 to 3.5 kg per year adjusted for age, based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention normative data). The majority of that increase occurred within the first 6 months of exposure to RISPERDAL  (r)  . The average percentiles at baseline and 12 months, respectively, were 49 and 60 for weight, 48 and 53 for height, and 50 and 62 for body mass index.

 In one 3-week, placebo-controlled trial in children and adolescent patients with  acute≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   manic≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   or≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   mixed≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   episodes≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   of≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   bipolar≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   I≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   disorder≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ,  increases≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   body≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   weight≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  were higher in the RISPERDAL  (r)  groups than the placebo group, but not dose related (1.90 kg in the RISPERDAL  (r)  0.5-2.5 mg group, 1.44 kg in the RISPERDAL  (r)  3-6 mg group, and 0.65 kg in the placebo group). A similar trend was observed in the  mean≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   change≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   from≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   baseline≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   in≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   body≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   mass≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   index≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE .

 When treating pediatric patients with RISPERDAL  (r)  for any indication,  weight≠B-NonOSE_AE   gain≠I-NonOSE_AE  should be assessed against that expected with normal growth.

    5.6  Hyperprolactinemia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE 

  As with other drugs that antagonize dopamine D2receptors, RISPERDAL  (r)   elevates≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   prolactin≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   levels≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and the elevation persists during chronic administration. RISPERDAL  (r)  is associated with higher levels of  prolactin≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   elevation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  than other antipsychotic agents.

  Hyperprolactinemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  may  suppress≠B-NonOSE_AE   hypothalamic≠I-NonOSE_AE   GnRH≠I-NonOSE_AE , resulting in  reduced≠B-NonOSE_AE   pituitary≠I-NonOSE_AE   gonadotropin≠I-NonOSE_AE   secretion≠I-NonOSE_AE . This, in turn, may  inhibit≠B-NonOSE_AE   reproductive≠I-NonOSE_AE   function≠I-NonOSE_AE  by  impairing≠B-NonOSE_AE   gonadal≠I-NonOSE_AE   steroidogenesis≠I-NonOSE_AE  in both female and male patients.  Galactorrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  amenorrhea≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  gynecomastia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and  impotence≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported in patients receiving prolactin-elevating compounds. Long-standing  hyperprolactinemia≠B-NonOSE_AE  when associated with  hypogonadism≠B-NonOSE_AE  may lead to  decreased≠B-NonOSE_AE   bone≠I-NonOSE_AE   density≠I-NonOSE_AE  in both female and male subjects.

 Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human  breast≠B-NonOSE_AE   cancers≠I-NonOSE_AE  are prolactin dependent in vitro  , a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with previously detected  breast≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   cancer≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . An increase in  pituitary≠B-NonOSE_AE   gland≠I-NonOSE_AE , mammary gland, and pancreatic islet cell  neoplasia≠I-NonOSE_AE  ( mammary≠B-NonOSE_AE   adenocarcinomas≠I-NonOSE_AE ,  pituitary≠B-NonOSE_AE  and pancreatic  adenomas≠I-NonOSE_AE ) was observed in the risperidone carcinogenicity studies conducted in mice and rats [see     Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)  ]  . Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration of this class of drugs and  tumorigenesis≠B-NonOSE_AE  in humans; the available evidence is considered too limited to be conclusive at this time.

    5.7 Orthostatic Hypotension

  RISPERDAL  (r)  may induce  orthostatic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   hypotension≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  associated with  dizziness≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  tachycardia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , and in some patients,  syncope≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE , especially during the initial dose-titration period, probably reflecting its alpha-adrenergic antagonistic properties.  Syncope≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was reported in 0.2% (6/2607) of RISPERDAL  (r)  -treated patients in Phase 2 and 3 studies in adults with  schizophrenia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate . The risk of  orthostatic≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   hypotension≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  syncope≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  may be minimized by limiting the initial dose to 2 mg total (either once daily or 1 mg twice daily) in normal adults and 0.5 mg twice daily in the elderly and patients with  renal≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  or hepatic  impairment≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  [see     Dosage and Administration (2.1    ,   2.4)  ]  . Monitoring of orthostatic vital signs should be considered in patients for whom this is of concern. A dose reduction should be considered if  hypotension≠B-NonOSE_AE  occurs. RISPERDAL  (r)  should be used with particular caution in patients with known  cardiovascular≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  (history of  myocardial≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   infarction≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  or  ischemia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ,  heart≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   failure≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , or  conduction≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   abnormalities≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ),  cerebrovascular≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   disease≠I-Not_AE_Candidate , and conditions which would predispose patients to  hypotension≠B-NonOSE_AE , e.g.,  dehydration≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  and  hypovolemia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate . Clinically significant  hypotension≠B-NonOSE_AE  has been observed with concomitant use of RISPERDAL  (r)  and  antihypertensive≠B-NonOSE_AE   medication≠I-NonOSE_AE .

    5.8 Falls

    Somnolence≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  postural≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   hypotension≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE ,  motor≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and sensory  instability≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported with the use of antipsychotics, including RISPERDAL  (r)  , which may lead to  falls≠B-NonOSE_AE  and, consequently,  fractures≠B-NonOSE_AE  or other  fall≠B-NonOSE_AE  -≠I-NonOSE_AE  related≠I-NonOSE_AE   injuries≠I-NonOSE_AE . For patients, particularly the elderly, with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, assess the risk of  falls≠B-NonOSE_AE  when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy.  

    5.9 Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis

   Class Effect:  In clinical trial and/or postmarketing experience, events of  leukopenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE / neutropenia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents, including RISPERDAL  (r)  .  Agranulocytosis≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  has also been reported.

 Possible risk factors for  leukopenia≠B-NonOSE_AE / neutropenia≠B-NonOSE_AE  include pre-existing  low≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   white≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   blood≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   cell≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   count≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   (≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  WBC≠I-Not_AE_Candidate ) and history of  drug≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  induced≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  leukopenia/ neutropenia≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . Patients with a history of a clinically significant  low≠B-Not_AE_Candidate   WBC≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  or a  drug≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  -≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  induced≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   leukopenia≠I-Not_AE_Candidate /neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and discontinuation of RISPERDAL  (r)  should be considered at the first sign of a clinically significant  decline≠B-NonOSE_AE   in≠I-NonOSE_AE   WBC≠I-NonOSE_AE  in the absence of other causative factors.

 Patients with clinically significant  neutropenia≠B-NonOSE_AE  should be carefully monitored for  fever≠B-NonOSE_AE  or other symptoms or signs of  infection≠B-NonOSE_AE  and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe  neutropenia≠B-NonOSE_AE  ( absolute≠B-NonOSE_AE   neutrophil≠I-NonOSE_AE   count≠I-NonOSE_AE   <≠I-NonOSE_AE  1≠I-NonOSE_AE  0≠I-NonOSE_AE  0≠I-NonOSE_AE  0≠I-NonOSE_AE  /≠I-NonOSE_AE  mm≠I-NonOSE_AE    3≠I-NonOSE_AE   ) should discontinue RISPERDAL  (r)  and have their WBC followed until recovery.

    5.10 Potential for  Cognitive≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and Motor  Impairment≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE 

   Somnolence≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  was a commonly reported adverse reaction associated with RISPERDAL  (r)  treatment, especially when ascertained by direct questioning of patients. This adverse reaction is dose-related, and in a study utilizing a checklist to detect adverse events, 41% of the high-dose patients (RISPERDAL  (r)  16 mg/day) reported  somnolence≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  compared to 16% of placebo patients. Direct questioning is more sensitive for detecting adverse events than spontaneous reporting, by which 8% of RISPERDAL  (r)  16 mg/day patients and 1% of placebo patients reported  somnolence≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  as an adverse reaction. Since RISPERDAL  (r)  has the potential to  impair≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   judgment≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE , thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that RISPERDAL  (r)  therapy does not affect them adversely.

    5.11 Seizures

  During premarketing testing in adult patients with  schizophrenia≠B-Not_AE_Candidate ,  seizures≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  occurred in 0.3% (9/2607) of RISPERDAL  (r)  -treated patients, two in association with  hyponatremia≠B-NonOSE_AE . RISPERDAL  (r)  should be used cautiously in patients with a history of  seizures≠B-Not_AE_Candidate .

    5.12  Dysphagia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE 

   Esophageal≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   dysmotility≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  aspiration≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been associated with antipsychotic drug use.  Aspiration≠B-NonOSE_AE   pneumonia≠I-NonOSE_AE  is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with advanced  Alzheimer≠B-Not_AE_Candidate  '≠I-Not_AE_Candidate  s≠I-Not_AE_Candidate   dementia≠I-Not_AE_Candidate . RISPERDAL  (r)  and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for  aspiration≠B-NonOSE_AE   pneumonia≠I-NonOSE_AE . [see     Boxed Warning  and  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  

    5.13 Priapism

   Priapism≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  has been reported during postmarketing surveillance. Severe  priapism≠B-NonOSE_AE  may require surgical intervention.

    5.14 Body Temperature Regulation

   Disruption≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE   of≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   body≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   temperature≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE   regulation≠I-OSE_Labeled_AE  has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Both  hyperthermia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  and  hypothermia≠B-OSE_Labeled_AE  have been reported in association with oral RISPERDAL  (r)  use. Caution is advised when prescribing for patients who will be exposed to temperature extremes.

    5.15 Patients with Phenylketonuria

  Inform patients that RISPERDAL  (r)  M-TAB  (r)  Orally Disintegrating Tablets contain phenylalanine .  Phenylalanine is a component of aspartame. Each 4 mg RISPERDAL  (r)  M-TAB  (r)  Orally Disintegrating Tablet contains 0.84 mg phenylalanine; each 3 mg RISPERDAL  (r)  M-TAB  (r)  Orally Disintegrating Tablet contains 0.63 mg phenylalanine; each 2 mg RISPERDAL  (r)  M-TAB  (r)  Orally Disintegrating Tablet contains 0.42 mg phenylalanine; each 1 mg RISPERDAL  (r)  M-TAB  (r)  Orally Disintegrating Tablet contains 0.28 mg phenylalanine; and each 0.5 mg RISPERDAL  (r)  M-TAB  (r)  Orally Disintegrating Tablet contains 0.14 mg phenylalanine.
