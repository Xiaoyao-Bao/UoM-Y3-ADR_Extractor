PRECAUTIONS O
General O
If O
Valium O
is O
to O
be O
combined O
with O
other O
psychotropic O
agents O
or O
anticonvulsant O
drugs O
, O
careful O
consideration O
should O
be O
given O
to O
the O
pharmacology O
of O
the O
agents O
to O
be O
employed O
- O
particularly O
with O
known O
compounds O
that O
may O
potentiate O
the O
action O
of O
diazepam O
, O
such O
as O
phenothiazines O
, O
narcotics O
, O
barbiturates O
, O
MAO O
inhibitors O
and O
other O
antidepressants O
( O
see O
Drug O
Interactions O
) O
. O

The O
usual O
precautions O
are O
indicated O
for O
severely O
depressed B-Not_AE_Candidate
patients O
or O
those O
in O
whom O
there O
is O
any O
evidence O
of O
latent O
depression B-Not_AE_Candidate
or O
anxiety B-Not_AE_Candidate
associated O
with I-Not_AE_Candidate
depression I-Not_AE_Candidate
, O
particularly O
the O
recognition O
that O
suicidal B-Not_AE_Candidate
tendencies I-Not_AE_Candidate
may O
be O
present O
and O
protective O
measures O
may O
be O
necessary O
. O

Psychiatric B-OSE_Labeled_AE
and O
paradoxical O
reactions I-OSE_Labeled_AE
are O
known O
to O
occur O
when O
using O
benzodiazepines O
( O
see O
ADVERSE O
REACTIONS O
) O
. O

Should O
this O
occur O
, O
use O
of O
the O
drug O
should O
be O
discontinued O
. O

These O
reactions O
are O
more O
likely O
to O
occur O
in O
children O
and O
the O
elderly O
. O

A O
lower O
dose O
is O
recommended O
for O
patients O
with O
chronic B-Not_AE_Candidate
respiratory I-Not_AE_Candidate
insufficiency I-Not_AE_Candidate
, O
due O
to O
the O
risk O
of O
respiratory B-NonOSE_AE
depression I-NonOSE_AE
. O

Benzodiazepines O
should O
be O
used O
with O
extreme O
caution O
in O
patients O
with O
a O
history O
of O
alcohol B-Not_AE_Candidate
or O
drug O
abuse I-Not_AE_Candidate
( O
see O
DRUG O
ABUSE O
AND O
DEPENDENCE O
) O
. O

In O
debilitated B-Not_AE_Candidate
patients O
, O
it O
is O
recommended O
that O
the O
dosage O
be O
limited O
to O
the O
smallest O
effective O
amount O
to O
preclude O
the O
development O
of O
ataxia B-NonOSE_AE
or O
oversedation B-NonOSE_AE
( O
2 O
mg O
to O
2.5 O
mg O
once O
or O
twice O
daily O
, O
initially O
, O
to O
be O
increased O
gradually O
as O
needed O
and O
tolerated O
) O
. O

Some O
loss B-OSE_Labeled_AE
of I-OSE_Labeled_AE
response I-OSE_Labeled_AE
to I-OSE_Labeled_AE
the I-OSE_Labeled_AE
effects I-OSE_Labeled_AE
of O
benzodiazepines O
may O
develop O
after O
repeated O
use O
of O
Valium O
for O
a O
prolonged O
time O

Information O
For O
Patients O
To O
assure O
the O
safe O
and O
effective O
use O
of O
benzodiazepines O
, O
patients O
should O
be O
informed O
that O
, O
since O
benzodiazepines O
may O
produce O
psychological O
and O
physical O
dependence O
, O
it O
is O
advisable O
that O
they O
consult O
with O
their O
physician O
before O
either O
increasing O
the O
dose O
or O
abruptly O
discontinuing O
this O
drug O
. O

The O
risk O
of O
dependence O
increases O
with O
duration O
of O
treatment O
; O
it O
is O
also O
greater O
in O
patients O
with O
a O
history O
of O
alcohol O
or O
drug O
abuse O
. O

Patients O
should O
be O
advised O
against O
the O
simultaneous O
ingestion O
of O
alcohol O
and O
other O
CNS-depressant O
drugs O
during O
Valium O
therapy O
. O

As O
is O
true O
of O
most O
CNS-acting O
drugs O
, O
patients O
receiving O
Valium O
should O
be O
cautioned O
against O
engaging O
in O
hazardous O
occupations O
requiring O
complete O
mental O
alertness O
, O
such O
as O
operating O
machinery O
or O
driving O
a O
motor O
vehicle O
. O

Drug O
Interactions O
Opioids O
The O
concomitant O
use O
of O
benzodiazepines O
and O
opioids O
increases O
the O
risk O
of O
respiratory B-NonOSE_AE
depression I-NonOSE_AE
because O
of O
actions O
at O
different O
receptor O
sites O
in O
the O
CNS O
that O
control O
respiration O
. O

Benzodiazepines O
interact O
at O
GABAAsites O
and O
opioids O
interact O
primarily O
at O
mu O
receptors O
. O

When O
benzodiazepines O
and O
opioids O
are O
combined O
, O
the O
potential O
for O
benzodiazepines O
to O
significantly O
worsen O
opioid-related O
respiratory B-NonOSE_AE
depression I-NonOSE_AE
exists O
. O

Limit O
dosage O
and O
duration O
of O
concomitant O
use O
of O
benzodiazepines O
and O
opioids O
, O
and O
monitor O
patients O
closely O
for O
respiratory B-NonOSE_AE
depression I-NonOSE_AE
and O
sedation B-NonOSE_AE

Agents O
If O

Alcohol O
Concomitant O

there O

the O

The O
lower O
